honesty had it stretch'd so far would have made nature immortal and death should have play for lack of work Would for the King 's sake he were living I think it would be the death of the King 's disease How call'd you the man you speak of madam He was famous sir in his profession and it was his great right to be so- Gerard de Narbon He was excellent indeed madam the King very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have liv'd still if knowledge could be set up against mortality What is it my good lord the King languishes of A fistula my lord I heard not of it before I would it were not notorious Was this gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon His sole child my lord and bequeathed to my overlooking I have those hopes of her good that her education promises her dispositions she inherits which makes fair gifts fairer for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities there commendations go with pity they are virtues and traitors too In her they are the better for their simpleness she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness Your commendations madam get from her tears ' Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek No more of this Helena go to no more lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than to have- I do affect a sorrow indeed but I have it too Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living If the living be enemy to the grief the excess makes it soon mortal Madam I desire your holy wishes How understand we that Be thou blest Bertram and succeed thy father In manners as in shape Thy blood and virtue Contend for empire in thee and thy goodness Share with thy birthright Love all trust a few Do wrong to none be able for thine enemy Rather in power than use and keep thy friend Under thy own life 's key be check'd for silence But never tax'd for speech What heaven more will That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down Fall on thy head Farewell My lord ' Tis an unseason'd courtier good my lord Advise him He can not want the best That shall attend his love Heaven bless him Farewell Bertram Exit The best wishes that can be forg'd in your thoughts be servants to you To HELENA Be comfortable to my mother your mistress and make much of her Farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU O were that all I think not on my father And these great tears grace his remembrance more Than those I shed for him What was he like I have forgot him my imagination Carries no favour in't but Bertram 's I am undone there is no living none If Bertram be away ' Twere all one That I should love a bright particular star And think to we d it he is so above me In his bright radiance and collateral light Must I be comforted not in his sphere Th ' ambition in my love thus plagues itself The hind that would be mated by the lion Must die for love ' Twas pretty though a plague To see him every hour to sit and draw His arched brows his hawking eye his curls In our heart 's table heart too capable Of every line and trick of his sweet favour But now he 's gone and my idolatrous fancy Must sanctify his relics Who comes here Save you fair queen And you monarch No And no Are you meditating on virginity Ay You have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question Man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him Keep him out But he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak Unfold to us some warlike resistance There is none Man setting down before you will undermine you and blow you up Bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up Is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men Virginity being blown down man will quicklier be blown up marry in blowing him down again with the breach yourselves I will stand for ' t a little though therefore I die a virgin There 's little can be said in ' t ' tis against the rule of nature To speak on the part of virginity is to accuse your mothers which is most infallible disobedience He that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit as a desperate offendress against nature Virginity breeds mites much like a cheese consumes itself to the very paring and so dies with feeding his own stomach Besides virginity is peevish proud idle made of self love which is the most inhibited sin in the canon Keep it not you can not choose but lose by't Out with't Within ten year it will make itself ten which is a goodly increase and the principal itself not much the worse Away with't How might one do sir to lose it to her own liking Let me see Marry ill to like him that ne'er it likes ' Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying the longer kept the less worth Off with't while ' tis vendible answer the time of request Virginity like an old courtier wears her cap out of fashion richly suited but unsuitable just like the brooch and the toothpick which wear not now Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek And your virginity your old virginity is like one of our French wither'd pears it looks ill it eats drily marry ' tis a wither'd pear it was formerly better marry yet ' tis a wither'd pear Will you anything with it Not my virginity yet There shall your master have a thousand loves A mother and a mistress and a friend A phoenix captain and an enemy A guide a goddess and a sovereign A counsellor a traitress and a dear His humble ambition proud humility His jarring concord and his discord dulcet His faith his sweet disaster with a world Of pretty fond adoptious christendoms That blinking Cupid gossips Now shall he- I know not what he shall God send him well The court 's a learning place and he is one- What one i ' faith That I wish well ' Tis pity- What 's pity That wishing well had not a body in't Which might be felt that we the poorer born Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes Might with effects of them follow our friends And show what we alone must think which never Returns us thanks Monsieur Parolles my lord calls for you Exit PAGE Little Helen farewell if I can remember thee I will think of thee at court Monsieur Parolles you were born under a charitable star Under Mars I. I especially think under Mars Why under Man The wars hath so kept you under that you must needs be born under Mars When he was predominant When he was retrograde I think rather Why think you so You go so much backward when you fight That 's for advantage So is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and I like the wear well I am so full of business I can not answer thee acutely I will return perfect courtier in the which my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee so thou wilt be capable of a courtier 's counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee else thou diest in thine unthankfulness and thine ignorance makes thee away Farewell When thou hast leisure say thy prayers when thou hast none remember thy friends Get thee a good husband and use him as he uses thee So farewell Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie Which we ascribe to heaven The fated sky Gives us free scope only doth backward pull Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull What power is it which mounts my love so high That makes me see and can not feed mine eye The mightiest space in fortune nature brings To join like likes and kiss like native things Impossible be strange attempts to those That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose What hath been can not be Who ever strove To show her merit that did miss her love The King 's disease my project may deceive me But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me Exit The Florentines and Senoys are by th ' ears Have fought with equal fortune and continue A braving war So ' tis reported sir Nay ' tis most credible We here receive it A certainty vouch'd from our cousin Austria With caution that the Florentine will move us For speedy aid wherein our dearest friend Prejudicates the business and would seem To have us make denial His love and wisdom Approv'd so to your Majesty may plead For amplest credence He hath arm'd our answer And Florence is denied before he comes Yet for our gentlemen that mean to see The Tuscan service freely have they leave To stand on either part It well may serve A nursery to our gentry who are sick For breathing and exploit What 's he comes here It is the Count Rousillon my good lord Young Bertram Youth thou bear'st thy father 's face Frank nature rather curious than in haste Hath well compos'd thee Thy father 's moral parts Mayst thou inherit too Welcome to Paris My thanks and duty are your Majesty 's I would I had that corporal soundness now As when thy father and myself in friendship First tried our soldiership He did look far Into the service of the time and was Discipled of the bravest He lasted long But on us both did haggish age steal on And wore us out of act It much repairs me To talk of your good father In his youth He had the wit which I can well observe To day in our young lords but they may jest Till their own scorn return to them unnoted Ere they can hide their levity in honour So like a courtier contempt nor bitterness Were in his pride or sharpness if they were His equal had awak'd them and his honour Clock to itself knew the true minute when Exception bid him speak and at this time His tongue obey'd his hand Who were below him He us'd as creatures of another place And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks Making them proud of his humility In their poor praise he humbled Such a man Might be a copy to these younger times Which followed well would demonstrate them now But goers backward His good remembrance sir Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb So in approof lives not his epitaph As in your royal speech Would I were with him He would always say- Methinks I hear him now his plausive words He scatter'd not in ears but grafted them To grow there and to bear- ' Let me not live'- This his good melancholy oft began On the catastrophe and heel of pastime When it was out-'Let me not live ' quoth he ' After my flame lacks oil to be the snuff Of younger spirits whose apprehensive senses All but new things disdain whose judgments are Mere fathers of their garments whose constancies Expire before their fashions ' This he wish'd I after him do after him wish too Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home I quickly were dissolved from my hive To give some labourers room You 're loved sir They that least lend it you shall lack you first I fill a place I know't How long is't Count Since the physician at your father 's died He was much fam'd Some six months since my lord If he were living I would try him yet- Lend me an arm the rest have worn me out

care I have had to even your content I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings when of ourselves we publish them What does this knave here Get you gone sirrah The complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe ' tis my slowness that I do not for I know you lack not folly to commit them and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours ' Tis not unknown to you madam I am a poor fellow Well sir No madam ' tis not so well that I am poor though many of the rich are damn'd but if I may have your ladyship 's good will to go to the world Isbel the woman and I will do as we may Wilt thou needs be a beggar I do beg your good will in this case In what case In Isbel 's case and mine own Service is no heritage and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I have issue o ' my body for they say bames are blessings Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry My poor body madam requires it I am driven on by the flesh and he must needs go that the devil drives Is this all your worship 's reason Faith madam I have other holy reasons such as they are May the world know them I have been madam a wicked creature as you and all flesh and blood are and indeed I do marry that I may repent Thy marriage sooner than thy wickedness I am out o ' friends madam and I hope to have friends for my wife 's sake Such friends are thine enemies knave Y'are shallow madam in great friends for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of He that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop If I be his cuckold he 's my drudge He that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo he that kisses my wife is my friend If men could be contented to be what they are there were no fear in marriage for young Charbon the puritan and old Poysam the papist howsome'er their hearts are sever'd in religion their heads are both one they may jowl horns together like any deer i ' th ' herd Wilt thou ever be a foul mouth'd and calumnious knave A prophet I madam and I speak the truth the next way Get you gone sir I 'll talk with you more anon May it please you madam that he bid Helen come to you Of her I am to speak Sirrah tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her Helen I mean Sings What one good in ten You corrupt the song sirrah One good woman in ten madam which is a purifying o ' th ' song Would God would serve the world so all the year We 'd find no fault with the tithe woman if I were the parson One in ten quoth ' a An we might have a good woman born before every blazing star or at an earthquake ' twould mend the lottery well a man may draw his heart out ere ' a pluck one You 'll be gone sir knave and do as I command you That man should be at woman 's command and yet no hurt done Though honesty be no puritan yet it will do no hurt it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart I am going forsooth The business is for Helen to come hither Well now I know madam you love your gentlewoman entirely Faith I do Her father bequeath'd her to me and she herself without other advantage may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds There is more owing her than is paid and more shall be paid her than she 'll demand Madam I was very late more near her than I think she wish'd me Alone she was and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears she thought I dare vow for her they touch'd not any stranger sense Her matter was she loved your son Fortune she said was no goddess that had put such difference betwixt their two estates Love no god that would not extend his might only where qualities were level Diana no queen of virgins that would suffer her poor knight surpris'd without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward This she deliver'd in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal sithence in the loss that may happen it concerns you something to know it YOU have discharg'd this honestly keep it to yourself Many likelihoods inform'd me of this before which hung so tott'ring in the balance that I could neither believe nor misdoubt Pray you leave me Stall this in your bosom and I thank you for your honest care I will speak with you further anon Exit STEWARD What is your pleasure madam You know Helen I am a mother to you Mine honourable mistress Nay a mother Why not a mother When I said ' a mother ' Methought you saw a serpent What 's in ' mother ' That you start at it I say I am your mother And put you in the catalogue of those That were enwombed mine ' Tis often seen Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds A native slip to us from foreign seeds You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother 's groan Yet I express to you a mother 's care God 's mercy maiden does it

of me I follow him not By any token of presumptuous suit Nor would I have him till I do deserve him Yet never know how that desert should be I know I love in vain strive against hope Yet in this captious and intenible sieve I still pour in the waters of my love And lack not to lose still Thus Indian like Religious in mine error I adore The sun that looks upon his worshipper But knows of him no more My dearest madam Let not your hate encounter with my love For loving where you do but if yourself Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth Did ever in so true a flame of liking Wish chastely and love dearly that your Dian Was both herself and Love O then give pity To her whose state is such that can not choose But lend and give where she is sure to lose That seeks not to find that her search implies But riddle like lives sweetly where she dies Had you not lately an intent speak truly- To go to Paris Madam I had Wherefore Tell true I will tell truth by grace itself I swear You know my father left me some prescriptions Of rare and prov'd effects such as his reading And manifest experience had collected For general sovereignty and that he will'd me In heedfull'st reservation to

lost This was your motive For Paris was it Speak My lord your son made me to think of this Else Paris and the medicine and the King Had from the conversation of my thoughts Haply been absent then But think you Helen If you should tender your supposed aid He would receive it He and his physicians Are of a mind he that they can not help him They that they can not help How shall they credit A poor unlearned virgin when the schools Embowell'd of their doctrine have let off The danger to itself There 's something in't More than my father 's skill which was the great'st Of his profession that his

yourself within the list of too cold an adieu Be more expressive to them for they wear themselves in the cap of the time there do muster true gait eat speak and move under the influence of the most receiv'd star and though the devil lead the measure such are to be followed After them and take a more dilated farewell And I will do so Worthy fellows and like to prove most sinewy sword men Kneeling Pardon my lord for me and for my tidings I 'll fee thee to stand up Then here 's a man stands that has brought his pardon I would you had kneel'd my lord to ask me mercy And that at my bidding you

royal fox Yes but you will My noble grapes an if my royal fox Could reach them I have seen a medicine That 's able to breathe life into a stone Quicken a rock and make you dance canary With spritely fire and motion whose simple touch Is powerful to araise King Pepin nay To give great Charlemain a pen in 's hand And write to her a love line What her is this Why Doctor She My lord there 's one arriv'd If you will see her Now by my faith and honour If seriously I may convey my thoughts In this my light deliverance I have spoke With one that in her sex her years profession Wisdom and

towards him Knowing him is enough On 's bed of death Many receipts he gave me chiefly one Which as the dearest issue of his practice And of his old experience th ' only darling He bade me store up as a triple eye Safer than mine own two more dear I have so And hearing your high Majesty is touch'd With that malignant cause wherein the honour Of my dear father 's gift stands chief in power I come to tender it and my appliance With all bound humbleness We thank you maiden But may not be so credulous of cure When our most learned doctors leave us and The congregated college have concluded That labouring art can never ransom nature From her inaidable estate I say we must not So stain our judgment or corrupt our hope To prostitute our past cure malady To empirics or to dissever so Our great self and our credit to esteem A senseless help when help past sense we deem My duty then shall pay me for my pains I will no more enforce mine office on you Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts A modest one to bear me back again I can not give thee less to be call'd grateful Thou thought'st to help me and such thanks I give As one near death to those that wish him live But what at full I know thou know'st no part I knowing all my peril thou no art What I can do can do no hurt to try Since you set up your rest ' gainst remedy He that of greatest works is finisher Oft does them by the weakest minister So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown When judges have been babes Great floods have flown From simple sources and great seas have dried When miracles have by the greatest been denied Oft expectation fails and most oft there Where most it promises and oft it hits Where hope is coldest and despair most fits I must not hear thee Fare thee well kind maid Thy pains not us'd must by thyself be paid Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd It is not so with Him that all things knows As ' tis with us that square our guess by shows But most it is presumption in us when The help of heaven we count the act of men Dear sir to my endeavours give consent Of heaven not me make an experiment I am not an impostor that proclaim Myself against the level of mine aim But know I think and think I know most sure My art is not past power nor you past cure Art thou so confident Within what space Hop'st thou my cure The greatest Grace lending grace Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring Ere twice in murk and occidental damp Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp Or four and twenty times the pilot 's glass Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly Health shall live free and sickness freely die Upon thy certainty and confidence What dar'st thou venture Tax of impudence A strumpet 's boldness a divulged shame Traduc'd by odious ballads my maiden 's name Sear'd otherwise ne worse of worst extended With vilest torture let my life be ended Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak His powerful sound within an organ weak And what impossibility would slay In common sense sense saves another way Thy life is dear for all that life can rate Worth name of life in thee hath estimate Youth beauty wisdom courage all That happiness and prime can happy call Thou this to hazard needs must intimate Skill infinite or monstrous desperate Sweet practiser thy physic I will try That ministers thine own death if I die If I break time or flinch in property Of what I spoke unpitied let me die And well deserv'd Not helping death 's my fee But if I help what do you promise me Make thy demand But will you make it even Ay by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand What husband in thy power I will command Exempted be from me the arrogance To choose from forth the royal blood of France My low and humble name to propagate With any branch or image of thy state But such a one thy vassal whom I know Is free for me to ask thee to bestow Here is my hand the premises observ'd Thy will by my performance shall be serv'd So make the choice of thy own time for I Thy resolv'd patient on thee still rely More should I question thee and more I must Though more to know could not be more to trust From whence thou cam'st how tended on But rest Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest Give me some help here ho If thou proceed As high as word my deed shall match thy deed Come on sir I shall now put you to the height of your breeding I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught I know my business is but to the court To the court Why what place make you special when you put off that with such contempt But to the court Truly madam if God have lent a man any manners he may easily put it off at court He that can not make a leg put off 's cap kiss his hand and say nothing has neither leg hands lip nor cap and indeed such a fellow to say precisely were not for the court but for me I have an answer will serve all men Marry that 's a bountiful answer that fits all questions It is like a barber 's chair that fits all buttocks the pin buttock the quatch buttock the brawn buttock or any buttock Will your answer serve fit to all questions As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney as your French crown for your taffety punk as Tib 's rush for Tom 's forefinger as a pancake for Shrove Tuesday a morris for Mayday as the nail to his hole the cuckold to his horn as a scolding quean to a wrangling knave as the nun 's lip to the friar 's mouth nay as the pudding to his skin Have you I say an answer of such fitness for all questions From below your duke to beneath your constable it will fit any question It must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands But a trifle neither in good faith if the learned should speak truth of it Here it is and all that belongs to't Ask me if I am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn To be young again if we could I will be a fool in question hoping to be the wiser by your answer I pray you sir are you a courtier O Lord sir!-There 's a simple putting off More more a hundred of them Sir I am a poor friend of yours that loves you O Lord sir!-Thick thick spare not me I think sir you can eat none of this homely meat O Lord sir!-Nay put me to't I warrant you You were lately whipp'd sir as I think O Lord sir!-Spare not me Do you cry ' O Lord sir ' at your whipping and ' spare not me ' Indeed your ' O Lord sir ' is very sequent to your whipping You would answer very well to a whipping if you were but bound to't I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my ' O Lord sir ' I see thing 's may serve long but not serve ever I play the noble housewife with the time To entertain it so merrily with a fool O Lord sir!-Why there't serves well again An end sir To your business give Helen this And urge her to a present answer back Commend me to my kinsmen and my son This is not much Not much commendation to them Not much employment for you You understand me Most fruitfully I am there before my legs Haste you again Exeunt They say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear Why ' tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times And so ' tis To be relinquish'd of the artists- So I say both of Galen and Paracelsus Of all the learned and authentic fellows- Right

my liege I shall beseech your Highness In such a business give me leave to use The help of mine own eyes Know'st thou not Bertram What she has done for me Yes my good lord But never hope to know why I should marry her Thou know'st she has rais'd me from my sickly bed But follows it my lord to bring me down Must answer for your raising I know her well She had her breeding at my father 's charge A poor physician 's daughter my wife Disdain Rather corrupt me ever ' Tis only title thou disdain'st in her the which I can build up Strange is it that our bloods Of colour weight and heat pour'd all together Would quite confound distinction yet stand off In differences so mighty If she be All that is virtuous save what thou dislik'st A poor physician 's daughter thou dislik'st Of virtue for the name but do not so From lowest place when virtuous things proceed The place is dignified by the doer 's deed Where great additions swell 's and virtue none It is a dropsied honour Good alone Is good without a name Vileness is so The property by what it is should go Not by the title She is young wise fair In these to nature she 's immediate heir And these breed honour That is honour 's scorn Which challenges itself as honour 's born And is not like the sire Honours thrive When rather from our acts we them derive Than our fore goers The mere word 's a slave Debauch'd on every tomb on every grave A lying trophy and as oft is dumb Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb Of honour'd bones indeed What should be said If thou canst like this creature as a maid I can create the rest Virtue and she Is her own dower honour and wealth from me I can not love her nor will strive to do ' t. Thou wrong'st thyself if thou shouldst strive to choose That you are well restor'd my lord I 'm glad Let the rest go My honour 's at the stake which to defeat I must produce my power Here take her hand Proud scornful boy unworthy this good gift That dost in vile misprision shackle up My love and her desert that canst not dream We poising us in her defective scale Shall weigh thee to the beam that wilt not know It is in us to plant thine honour where We please to have it grow Check thy contempt Obey our will which travails in thy good Believe not thy disdain but presently Do thine own fortunes that obedient right Which both thy duty owes and our power claims Or I will throw thee from my care for ever Into the staggers and the careless lapse Of youth and ignorance both my revenge and hate Loosing upon thee in the name of justice Without all terms of pity Speak thine answer Pardon my gracious lord for I submit My fancy to your eyes When I consider What great creation and what dole of honour Flies where you bid it I find that she which late Was in my nobler thoughts most base is now The praised of the King who so ennobled Is as ' twere born so Take her by the hand And tell her she is thine to whom I promise A counterpoise if not to thy estate A balance more replete I take her hand Good fortune and the favour of the King Smile upon this contract whose ceremony Shall seem expedient on the now born brief And be perform'd to night The solemn feast Shall more attend upon the coming space Expecting absent friends As thou lov'st her Thy love 's to me religious else does err

this French earl the honour of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as honesty I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion I know that knave hang him one Parolles a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl Beware of them Diana their promises enticements oaths tokens and all these engines of lust are not the things they go under many a maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is example that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood can not for all that dissuade succession but that they are limed with the twigs that threatens them I hope I need not to advise you further but I hope your own grace will keep you where you are though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost You shall not need to fear me I hope so Look here comes a pilgrim I know she will lie at my house thither they send one another I 'll question her God save you pilgrim Whither are bound To Saint Jaques le Grand Where do the palmers lodge I do beseech you At the Saint Francis here beside the port Is this the way Ay marry is't Hark you They come this way If you will tarry holy pilgrim But till the troops come by I will conduct you where you shall be lodg'd The rather for I think I know your hostess As ample as myself Is it yourself If you shall please so pilgrim I thank you and will stay upon your leisure You came I think from France I did so Here you shall see a countryman of yours That has done worthy service His name I pray you The Count Rousillon Know you such a one But by the ear that hears most nobly of him His face I know not What some'er he is He 's bravely taken here He stole from France As ' tis reported for the King had married him Against his liking Think you it is so Ay surely mere the truth I know his lady There is a gentleman that serves the Count Reports but coarsely of her What 's his name Monsieur Parolles O I believe with him In argument of praise or to the worth Of the great Count himself she is too mean To have her name repeated all her deserving Is a reserved honesty and that I have not heard examin'd Alas poor lady ' Tis a hard bondage to become the wife Of a detesting lord I sweet good creature wheresoe'er she is Her heart weighs sadly This young maid might do her A shrewd turn if she pleas'd How do you mean May be the amorous Count solicits her In the

Please it this matron and this gentle maid To eat with us to night the charge and thanking Shall be for me and to requite you further I will bestow some precepts of this virgin Worthy the note BOTH We 'll take your offer kindly Exeunt Nay good my lord put him to't let him have his way If your lordship find him not a hiding hold me no more in your respect On my life my lord a bubble Do you think I am so far deceived in him Believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman he 's a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promise breaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship 's entertainment It were fit you knew him lest reposing too far in his virtue which he hath not he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you I would I knew in what particular action to try him None better than to let him fetch off his drum which you hear him so confidently undertake to do I with a troop of Florentines will suddenly surprise him such I will have whom I am sure he knows not from the enemy We will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents Be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in anything O for the love of laughter let him fetch his drum he says he has a stratagem for't When your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted if you give him not John Drum 's entertainment your inclining can not be removed Here he comes O for the love of laughter hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand How now monsieur This drum sticks sorely in your disposition A pox on ' t let it go ' tis but a drum But a drum Is't but a drum A drum so lost There was excellent command to charge in with our horse upon our own wings and to rend our own soldiers That was not to be blam'd in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that Caesar himself could not have prevented if he had been there to command Well we can not greatly condemn our success Some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum but it is not to be recovered It might have been recovered It might but it is not now It is to be recovered But that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer I would have that drum or another or ' hic jacet ' Why if you have a stomach to't monsieur If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on I will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit If you speed well in it the Duke shall both speak of it and extend to you what further becomes his greatness even to the utmost syllable of our worthiness By the hand of a soldier I will undertake it But you must not now slumber in it I 'll about it this evening and I will presently pen down my dilemmas encourage myself in my certainty put myself into my mortal preparation and by midnight look to hear further from me May I be bold to acquaint his Grace you are gone about it I know not what the success will be my lord but the attempt I vow I know th ' art valiant and to the of thy soldiership will subscribe for thee Farewell I love not many words Exit No more than a fish loves water Is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damn'd than to do ' t. You do not know him my lord as we do Certain it is that he will steal himself into a man 's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries but when you find him out you have him ever after Why do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto None in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies But we have almost emboss'd him You shall see his fall to night for indeed he is not for your lordship 's respect We 'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him He was first smok'd by the old Lord Lafeu When his disguise and he is parted tell me what a sprat you shall find him which you shall see this very night I must go look my twigs he shall be caught Your brother he shall go along with me As't please your lordship I 'll leave you Exit Now will I lead you to the house and show you The lass I spoke of But you say she 's honest That 's all the fault I spoke with her but once And found her wondrous cold but I sent to her By this same coxcomb that we have i ' th ' wind Tokens and letters which she did re send And this is all I have done She 's a fair creature Will you go see her With all my heart my lord Exeunt If you misdoubt me that I am not she I know not how I shall assure you further But I shall lose the grounds I work upon Though my estate be fall'n I was well born Nothing acquainted with these businesses And would not put my reputation now In any staining act Nor would I wish you I should believe you For you have show'd me that which well approves Y'are great in fortune Take this purse of gold And let me buy your friendly help thus far Which I will over pay and pay again When I have found it The Count he woos your daughter Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty Resolv'd to carry her Let her in fine consent As we 'll direct her how ' tis best to bear it Now his important blood will nought deny That she 'll demand A ring the County wears That downward hath succeeded in his house From son to son some four or five descents Since the first father wore it This ring he holds In most rich choice yet in his idle fire To buy his will it would not seem too dear Howe'er repented after Now I see The bottom of your purpose You see it lawful then It is no more But that your daughter ere she seems as won Desires this ring appoints him an encounter In fine delivers me to fill the time Herself most chastely absent After this To marry her I 'll add three thousand crowns To what is pass'd already I have yielded Instruct my daughter how she shall persever That time and place with this deceit so lawful May prove coherent Every night he comes With musics of all sorts and songs compos'd To her unworthiness It nothing steads us To chide him from our eaves for he persists As if his life lay on ' t. Why then to night Let us assay our plot which if it speed Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed And lawful meaning in a lawful act Where both not sin and yet a sinful fact But let 's about it Exeunt He can come no other way but by this hedge corner When you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter Good captain let me be th ' interpreter Art not acquainted with him Knows he not thy voice No sir I warrant you But what linsey woolsey has thou to speak to us again E'en such as you speak to me He must think us some band of strangers i ' th ' adversary 's entertainment Now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose choughs ' language gabble enough and good enough As for you interpreter you must seem very politic But couch ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges Ten o'clock Within these three hours ' twill be time

too foolhardy but my heart hath the fear of Mars before it and of his creatures not daring the reports of my tongue This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of What the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum being not ignorant of the impossibility and knowing I had no such purpose I must give myself some hurts and say I got them in exploit Yet slight ones will not carry it They will say ' Came you off with so little ' And great ones I dare not give Wherefore what 's the instance Tongue I must put you into a butterwoman 's mouth and buy myself another of Bajazet 's mule if you prattle me into these perils Is it possible he should know what he is and be that he is I would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn or the breaking of my

of our camp I 'll show Their force their purposes Nay I 'll speak that Which you will wonder at But wilt thou faithfully If I do not damn me Acordo linta Come on thou art granted space Go tell the Count Rousillon and my brother We have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled Till we do hear from them Captain I will ' A will betray us all unto ourselves- Inform on that So I will sir Till then I 'll keep him dark and safely lock'd They told me that your name was Fontibell No my good lord Diana Titled goddess And worth it with addition But fair soul In your fine frame hath love no quality If the quick fire of youth light not your mind You are no maiden but a monument When you are dead you should be such a one As you are now for you are cold and stern And now you should be as your mother was When your sweet self was got She then was honest So should you be No My mother did but duty such my lord As you owe to your wife No more o'that I prithee do not strive against my vows I was compell'd to her but I love the By love 's own sweet constraint and will for ever Do thee all rights of service Ay so you serve us Till we serve you but when you have our roses You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves And mock us with our bareness How have I sworn ' Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth But the plain single vow that is vow'd true What is not holy that we swear not by But take the High'st to witness Then pray you tell me If I should swear by Jove 's great attributes I lov'd you dearly would you believe my oaths When I did love you ill This has no holding To swear by him whom I protest to love That I will work against him Therefore your oaths Are words and poor conditions but unseal'd- At least in my opinion Change it change it Be not so holy cruel Love is holy And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts That you do charge men with Stand no more off But give thyself unto my sick desires Who then recovers Say thou art mine and ever My love as it begins shall so persever I see that men make ropes in such a scarre That we 'll forsake ourselves Give me that ring I 'll lend it thee my dear but have no power To give it from me Will you not my lord It is an honour ' longing to our house Bequeathed down from many ancestors Which were the greatest obloquy i ' th ' world In me to lose Mine honour 's such a ring My chastity 's the jewel of our house Bequeathed down from many ancestors Which were the greatest obloquy i ' th ' world In me to lose Thus your own proper wisdom Brings in the champion Honour on my part Against your vain assault Here take my ring My house mine honour yea my life be thine And I 'll be bid by thee When midnight comes knock at my chamber window I 'll order take my mother shall not hear Now will I charge you in the band of truth When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed Remain there but an hour nor speak to me My reasons are most strong and you shall know them When back again this ring shall be deliver'd And on your finger in the night I 'll put Another ring that what in time proceeds May token to the future our past deeds Adieu till then then fail not You have won A wife of me though there my hope be done A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee For which live long to thank both heaven and me You may so in the end My mother told me just how he would woo As if she sat in 's heart she says all men Have the like oaths He had sworn to marry me When his wife 's dead therefore I 'll lie with him When I am buried Since Frenchmen are so braid Marry that will I live and die a maid Only in this disguise I think't no sin To cozen him that would unjustly win Exit You have not given him his mother 's letter I have deliv'red it an hour since There is something in't that stings his nature for on the reading it he chang'd almost into another man He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady Especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the King who had even tun'd his bounty to sing happiness to him I will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you When you have spoken it ' tis dead and I am the grave of it He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in Florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour He hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition Now God delay our rebellion As we are ourselves what things are we Merely our own traitors And as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorr'd ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream o'erflows himself Is it not meant damnable in us to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents We shall not then have his company to night Not till after midnight for he is dieted to his hour That approaches apace I would gladly have him see his company anatomiz'd that he might take a measure of his own judgments wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit We will not meddle with him till he come for his presence must be the whip of the other In the meantime what hear you of these wars I hear there is an overture of peace Nay I assure you a peace concluded What will Count Rousillon do then Will he travel higher or return again into France I perceive by this demand you are not altogether of his counsel Let it be forbid sir So should I be a great deal of his act Sir his wife some two months since fled from his house Her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplish'd and there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief in fine made a groan of her last breath and now she sings in heaven How is this justified The stronger part of it by her own letters which makes her story true even to the point of her death Her death itself which could not be her office to say is come was faithfully confirm'd by the rector of the place Hath the Count all this intelligence Ay and the particular confirmations point from point to the full arming of the verity I am heartily sorry that he 'll be glad of this How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses And how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears The great dignity that his valour hath here acquir'd for him shall at home be encount'red with a shame as ample The web of our life is of a mingled yarn good and ill together Our virtues would be proud if our faults whipt them not and our crimes would despair if they were not cherish'd by our virtues He met the Duke in the street sir of whom he hath taken a solemn leave His lordship will next morning for France The Duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the King They shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commend They can not be too sweet for the King 's tartness Here 's his lordship now I have to night dispatch'd sixteen businesses a month 's length apiece by an abstract of success I have congied with the Duke done my adieu with his nearest buried a wife mourn'd for her writ to my lady mother I am returning entertain'd my convoy and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs The last was the greatest but that I have not ended yet If the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship I mean the business is not ended as fearing to hear of it hereafter But shall we have this dialogue between the Fool and the Soldier Come bring forth this counterfeit module has deceiv'd me like a double meaning prophesier Bring him forth Exeunt SOLDIERS Has sat i ' th ' stocks all night poor gallant knave No matter his heels have deserv'd it in usurping his spurs so long How does he carry himself I have told your lordship already the stocks carry him But to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confess'd himself to Morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i ' th ' stocks And what think you he hath confess'd Nothing of me has ' a His confession is taken and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be in't as I believe you are you must have the patience to hear it A plague upon him muffled He can say nothing of me Hush hush Hoodman comes Portotartarossa He calls for the tortures What will you say without 'em I will confess what I know without constraint if ye pinch me like a pasty I can say no more Bosko chimurcho Boblibindo chicurmurco YOU are a merciful general Our General bids you answer to what I shall ask you out of a note And truly as I hope to live ' First demand of him how many horse the Duke is strong ' What say you to that Five or six thousand but very weak and unserviceable The troops are all scattered and the commanders very poor rogues upon my reputation and credit and as I hope to live Shall I set down your answer so Do I 'll take the sacrament on ' t how and which way you will All 's one to him What a past saving slave is this Y'are deceiv'd my lord this is Monsieur Parolles the gallant militarist that was his own phrase that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf and the practice in the chape of his dagger I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have everything in him by wearing his apparel neatly Well that 's set down ' Five or six thousand horse ' I said I will say true- ' or thereabouts ' set down for I 'll speak truth He 's very near the truth in this But I con him no thanks for't in the nature he delivers it ' Poor rogues ' I pray you say Well that 's set down I humbly thank you sir A truth 's a truth the rogues are marvellous poor ' Demand of him of what strength they are a foot ' What say you to that By my troth sir if I were to live this present hour I will tell true Let me see Spurio a hundred and fifty Sebastian so many Corambus so many Jaques so many Guiltian Cosmo Lodowick and Gratii two hundred fifty each mine own company Chitopher Vaumond Bentii two hundred fifty each so that the muster file rotten and sound upon my life amounts not to fifteen thousand poll half of the which dare not shake the snow from off their cassocks lest they shake themselves to pieces What shall be done to him Nothing but let him have thanks Demand of him my condition and what credit I have with the Duke Well that 's set down ' You shall demand of him whether one Captain Dumain be i ' th ' camp a Frenchman what his reputation is with the Duke what his valour honesty expertness in wars or whether he thinks it were not possible with well weighing sums of gold to corrupt him to a revolt ' What say you to this What do you know of it I beseech you let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories Demand them singly Do you know this Captain Dumain I know him ' a was a botcher 's prentice in Paris from whence he was whipt for getting the shrieve 's fool with child a dumb innocent that could not say him nay Nay by your leave hold your hands though I know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls Well is this captain in the Duke of Florence 's camp Upon my knowledge he is and lousy Nay look not so upon me we shall hear of your lordship anon What is his reputation with the Duke The Duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine and writ to me this other day to turn him out o ' th ' band I think I have his letter in my pocket Marry we 'll search In good sadness I do not know either it is there or it is upon a file with the Duke 's other letters in my tent Here ' tis here 's a paper Shall I read it to you I do not know if it be it or no Our interpreter does it well Excellently Reads ' Dian the Count 's a fool and full of gold ' That is not the Duke 's letter sir that is an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence one Diana to take heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon a foolish idle boy but for all that very ruttish I pray you sir put it up again Nay I 'll read it first by your favour My meaning in't I protest was very honest in the behalf of the maid for I knew the young Count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds Damnable both sides rogue Reads ' When he swears oaths bid him drop gold and take it After he scores he never pays the score Half won is match well made match and well make it He ne'er pays after debts take it before And say a soldier Dian told thee this Men are to mell with boys are not to kiss For count of this the Count 's a fool I know it Who pays before but not when he does owe it Thine as he vow'd to thee in thine ear He shall be whipt through the army with this rhyme in 's forehead This is your devoted friend sir the manifold linguist and the amnipotent soldier I could endure anything before but a cat and now he 's a cat to me I perceive sir by our General 's looks we shall be fain to hang you My life sir in any case Not that I am afraid to die but that my offences being many I would repent out the remainder of nature Let me live sir in a dungeon i ' th ' stocks or anywhere so I may live We 'll see what may be done so you confess freely therefore once more to this Captain Dumain you have answer'd to his reputation with the Duke and to his valour what is his honesty He will steal sir an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus He professes not keeping of oaths in breaking 'em he is stronger than Hercules He will lie sir with such volubility that you would think truth were a fool Drunkenness is his best virtue for he will be swine drunk and in his sleep he does little harm save to his bedclothes about him but they know his conditions and lay him in straw I have but little more to say sir of his honesty He has everything that an honest man should not have what an honest man should have he has nothing I begin to love him for this For this description of thine honesty A pox upon him For me he 's more and more a cat What say you to his expertness in war Faith sir has led the drum before the English tragedians to belie him I will not and more of his soldier ship I know not except in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called Mile end to instruct for the doubling of files I would do the man what honour I can but of this I am not certain He hath out villain'd villainy so far that the rarity redeems him A pox on him he 's a cat still His qualities being at this poor price I need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt Sir for a cardecue he will sell the fee simple of his salvation the inheritance of it and cut th ' entail from all remainders and a perpetual succession for it perpetually What 's his brother the other Captain Dumain Why does he ask him of me What 's he E'en a crow o ' th ' same nest not altogether so great as the first in goodness but greater a great deal in evil He excels his brother for a coward yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is In a retreat he outruns any lackey marry in coming on he has the cramp If your life be saved will you undertake to betray the Florentine Ay and the Captain of his Horse Count Rousillon I 'll whisper with the General and know his pleasure Aside I 'll no more drumming A plague of all drums Only to seem to deserve well and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the Count have I run into this danger Yet who would have suspected an ambush where I was taken There is no remedy sir but you must die The General says you that have so traitorously discover'd the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held can serve the world for no honest use therefore you must die Come headsman of with his head O Lord sir let me live or let me see my death That shall you and take your leave of all your friends Unmuffling him So look about you know you any here Good morrow noble Captain God bless you Captain Parolles God save you noble Captain Captain what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu I am for France Good Captain will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon An I were not a very coward I 'd compel it of you but fare you well You are undone Captain all but your scarf that has a knot on ' t yet Who can not be crush'd with a plot If you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame you might begin an impudent nation Fare ye well sir I am for France too we shall speak of you there Exit with SOLDIERS Yet am I thankful If my heart were great ' Twould burst at this Captain I 'll be no more But I will eat and drink and sleep as soft As captain shall Simply the thing I am Shall make me live Who knows himself a braggart Let him fear this for it will come to pass That every braggart shall be found an ass Rust sword cool blushes and Parolles live Safest in shame Being fool'd by fool'ry thrive There 's place and means for every man alive I 'll after them Exit That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you One of the greatest in the Christian world Shall be my surety fore whose throne ' tis needful Ere I can perfect mine intents to kneel Time was I did him a desired office Dear almost as his life which gratitude Through flinty Tartar 's bosom would peep forth And answer ' Thanks ' I duly am inform'd His Grace is at Marseilles to which place We have convenient convoy You must know I am supposed dead

was more welcome Nor you mistress Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour To recompense your love Doubt not but heaven Hath brought me up to be your daughter 's dower As it hath fated her to be my motive And helper to a husband But O strange men That can such sweet use make of what they hate When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts Defiles the pitchy night So lust doth play With what it loathes for that which is away But more of this hereafter You Diana Under my poor instructions yet must suffer Something in my behalf Let death and honesty Go with your impositions I am yours Upon

would have made all the unbak'd and doughy youth of a nation in his colour Your daughter in law had been alive at this hour and your son here at home more advanc'd by the King than by that red tail'd humble bee I speak of I would I had not known him It was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating If she had partaken of my flesh and cost me the dearest groans of a mother I could not have owed her a more rooted love ' Twas a good lady ' twas a good lady We may pick a thousand sallets ere we light on such another herb Indeed sir she was the sweet marjoram of the sallet or rather the herb of grace They are not sallet herbs you knave they are nose herbs I am no great Nebuchadnezzar sir I have not much skill in grass Whether dost thou profess thyself a knave or a fool A fool sir at a woman 's service and a knave at a man 's Your distinction I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service So you were a knave at his service indeed And I would give his wife my bauble sir to do her service I will subscribe for thee thou art both knave and fool At your service No no no Why sir if I can not serve you I can serve as great a prince as you

humble themselves may but the many will be too chill and tender and they 'll be for the flow'ry way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire Go thy ways I begin to be aweary of thee and I tell thee so before because I would not fall out with thee Go thy ways let my horses be well look'd to without any tricks If I put any tricks upon 'em sir they shall be jades ' tricks which are their own

sauciness and indeed he has no pace but runs where he will I like him well ' tis not amiss And I was about to tell you since I heard of the good lady 's death and that my lord your son was upon his return home I moved the King my master to speak in the behalf of my daughter which in the minority of them both his Majesty out of a self gracious remembrance did first propose His Highness hath promis'd me to do it and to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your son there is no fitter matter How does your ladyship like it With very much content my lord and I wish it happily effected His Highness comes post from Marseilles of as able body as when he number'd thirty ' a will be here to morrow or I am deceiv'd by him that in such intelligence hath seldom fail'd It rejoices me that I hope I shall see him ere I die I have letters that my son will be here to night I shall beseech your lordship to remain with me tal they meet together Madam I was thinking with what manners I might safely be admitted You need but plead your honourable privilege Lady of that I have made a bold charter but I thank my God it holds yet O madam yonder 's my lord your son with a patch of velvet on 's face whether there be a scar under ' t or no the velvet knows but ' tis a goodly patch of velvet His left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half but his right cheek is worn bare A scar

dozen of 'em with delicate fine hats and most courteous feathers which bow the head and nod at every man But this exceeding posting day and night Must wear your spirits low we can not help it But since you have made the days and nights as one To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs Be bold you do so grow in my requital As nothing can unroot you And you Sir I have seen you in the court of

time seem so adverse and means unfit I do beseech you whither is he gone Marry as I take it to Rousillon Whither I am going I do beseech you sir Since you are like to see the King before me Commend the paper to his gracious hand Which I presume shall render you no blame But rather make you thank your pains for it I will come after you with what good speed Our means will make us means This I 'll

stool to give to a nobleman Look here he comes himself My lord I am a man whom Fortune hath cruelly scratch'd And what would you have me to do ' Tis too late to pare her nails now Wherein have you played the knave with Fortune that she should scratch you who of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves thrive long under her There 's a cardecue for you Let the justices make you and Fortune friends I am for other business I beseech your honour to hear me one single word You beg a single penny more come you shall ha't save your word My name my good lord is Parolles You beg more than word then Cox my passion give me your hand How does your drum O my good lord you were the first that found me Was I in sooth And I was the first that lost thee It lies in you my lord to bring me in some grace for you did bring me out Out upon thee knave Dost thou put upon me at once both the office of God and the devil One brings the in grace and the other brings thee out Trumpets sound The King 's coming I know by his trumpets Sirrah inquire further after me I had talk of you last night Though you are a fool and a knave you shall eat Go to follow I praise God for you Exeunt We lost a jewel of her and our esteem Was made much poorer by it but your son As mad in folly lack'd the sense to know Her estimation home ' Tis past my liege And I beseech your Majesty to make it Natural

all He lost a wife Whose beauty did astonish the survey Of richest eyes whose words all ears took captive Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve Humbly call'd mistress Praising what is lost Makes the remembrance dear Well call him hither We are reconcil'd and the first view shall kill All repetition Let him not ask our pardon The nature of his great offence is dead And deeper than

Dear sovereign pardon to me All is whole Not one word more of the consumed time Let 's take the instant by the forward top For we are old and on our quick'st decrees Th ' inaudible and noiseless foot of Time Steals ere we can effect them You remember The daughter of this lord Admiringly my liege At first I stuck my choice upon her ere my heart Durst make too bold herald of my tongue Where the impression of mine eye infixing Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me Which warp'd the line of every other favour Scorn'd a fair colour or express'd it stol'n Extended or contracted all proportions To a most hideous object Thence it came That she whom all men prais'd and whom myself Since I have lost have lov'd was in mine eye The dust that did offend it Well excus'd That thou didst love her strikes some scores away From the great compt but love that comes too late Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried To the great sender turns a sour offence Crying ' That 's good that 's gone ' Our rash faults Make trivial price of serious things we have Not knowing them until we know their grave Oft our displeasures to ourselves unjust Destroy our friends and after weep their dust Our own love waking cries to see what 's done While shameful hate sleeps out the afternoon Be this sweet Helen 's knell And now forget her Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin The main consents are had and here we 'll stay To see our widower 's second marriage day Which better than the first O dear heaven bless Or ere they meet in me O nature cesse Come on my son in whom my house 's name Must be digested give a favour from you To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter That she may quickly come Hers it was not Now pray you let me see it for mine eye While I was speaking oft was fasten'd to't This ring was mine and when I gave it Helen I bade her if her fortunes ever stood Necessitied to help that by this token I would relieve her Had you that craft to reave her Of what should stead her most My gracious sovereign Howe'er it pleases you to take it so The ring was never hers Son on my life I have seen her wear it and she reckon'd it At her life 's rate I am sure I saw her wear it You are deceiv'd my lord she never saw it In Florence was it from a casement thrown me Wrapp'd in a paper which contain'd the name Of her that threw it Noble she was and thought I stood engag'd but when I had subscrib'd To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully I could not answer in that course of honour As she had made the overture she ceas'd In heavy satisfaction and would never Receive the ring again Plutus himself That knows the tinct and multiplying med'cine Hath not in nature 's mystery more science Than I have in this ring ' Twas mine ' twas Helen 's Whoever gave it you Then if you know That you are well acquainted with yourself Confess ' twas hers and by what rough enforcement You got it from her She call'd the saints to surety That she would never put it from her finger Unless she gave it to yourself in bed- Where you have never come- or sent it us Upon her great disaster She never saw it Thou speak'st it falsely as I love mine honour And mak'st conjectural fears to come into me Which I would fain shut out If it should prove That thou art so inhuman- ' twill not prove so And yet I know not- thou didst hate her deadly And she is dead which nothing but to close Her eyes myself could win me to believe More than to see this ring Take him away If you shall prove This ring was ever hers you shall as easy Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence Where she yet never was Exit guarded I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings Gracious sovereign Whether I have been to blame or no I know not Here 's a petition from a Florentine Who hath for four or five removes come short To tender it herself I undertook it Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech Of the poor suppliant who by this I know Is here attending her business looks in her With an importing visage and she told me In a sweet verbal brief it did concern Your Highness with herself Reads the letter ' Upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead I blush to say it he won me Now is the Count Rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me and my honour 's paid to him He stole from Florence taking no leave and I follow him to his country for justice Grant it me O King in you it best lies otherwise a seducer flourishes and a poor maid is undone I will buy me a son in law in a fair and toll for this I 'll none of him The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu To bring forth this discov'ry Seek these suitors Go speedily and bring again the Count Now justice on the doers I wonder sir sith wives are monsters to you And that you fly them as you swear them lordship Yet you desire to marry I am my lord a wretched Florentine Derived from the ancient Capilet My suit as I do understand you know And therefore know how far I may be pitied I am her mother sir whose age and honour Both suffer under this complaint we bring And both shall cease without your remedy Come hither Count do you know these women My lord I neither can nor will deny But that I know them Do they charge me further Why do you look so strange upon your wife She 's none of mine my lord If you shall marry You give away this hand and that is mine You give away heaven 's vows and those are mine You give away myself which is known mine For I by vow am so embodied yours That she which marries you must marry me Either both or none To BERTRAM Your reputation comes too short for my daughter you are no husband

Whose high respect and rich validity Did lack a parallel yet for all that He gave it to a commoner o ' th ' camp If I be one He blushes and ' tis it Of six preceding ancestors that gem Conferr'd by testament to th ' sequent issue Hath it been ow'd and worn This is his wife That ring 's a thousand proofs Methought you said You saw one here in court could witness it I did my lord but loath am to

Certain it is I lik'd her And boarded her i ' th ' wanton way of youth She knew her distance and did angle for me Madding my eagerness with her restraint As all impediments in fancy 's course Are motives of more fancy and in fine Her infinite cunning with her modern grace Subdu'd me to her rate She got the ring And I had that which any inferior might At market price have bought I must be patient You that have turn'd off a first so noble wife May justly diet me I pray you yet- Since you lack virtue I will lose a husband- Send for your ring I will return it home And give me mine again I have it not What ring was yours I pray you Sir much like The same upon your finger Know you this ring This ring was his of late And this was it I gave him being abed The story then goes false you threw it him Out of a casement I have spoke the truth My lord I do confess the ring was hers You boggle shrewdly every feather starts you Is this the man you speak of Ay my lord Tell me sirrah but tell me true I charge you Not fearing the displeasure of your master Which on your just proceeding I 'll keep off- By him and by this woman here what know you So please your Majesty my master hath been an honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him which gentlemen have Come come to th ' purpose Did he love this woman Faith sir he did love her but how How I pray you He did love her sir as a gentleman loves a woman How is that He lov'd her sir and lov'd her not As thou art a knave and no knave What an equivocal companion is this I am a poor man and at your Majesty 's command He 's a good drum my lord but a naughty orator Do you know he promis'd me marriage Faith I know more than I 'll speak But wilt thou not speak all thou know'st Yes so please your Majesty I did go between them as I said but more than that he loved her for indeed he was mad for her and talk'd of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what Yet I was in that credit with them at that time that I knew of their going to bed and of other motions as promising her marriage and things which would derive me ill will to speak of therefore I will not speak what I know Thou hast spoken all already unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence therefore stand aside This ring you say was yours Ay my good lord Where did you buy it Or who gave it you It was not given me nor I did not buy it Who lent it you It was not lent me neither Where did you find it then I found it not If it were yours by none of all these ways How could you give it him I never gave it him This woman 's an easy glove my lord she goes of and on at pleasure This ring was mine I gave it his first wife It might be yours or hers for aught I know Take her away I do not like her now To prison with her And away with him Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring Thou diest within this hour I 'll never tell you Take her away I 'll put in bail my liege I think thee now some common customer By Jove if ever I knew man ' twas you Wherefore hast thou accus'd him all this while Because he 's guilty and he is not guilty He knows I am no maid and he 'll swear to't I 'll swear I am a maid and he knows not Great King I am no strumpet by my life I am either maid or else this old man 's wife She does abuse our ears to prison with her Good mother fetch my bail Stay royal sir Is there no exorcist Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes Is't real that I see No my good lord ' Tis but the shadow of a wife you see The name and not the thing Both both o pardon O my good lord when I was like this maid I found you wondrous kind There is your ring And look you here 's your letter This it says ' When from my finger you can get this ring And are by me with child ' etc This is done Will you be mine now you are doubly won If she my liege can make me know this clearly I 'll love her dearly ever ever dearly If it appear not plain and prove untrue Deadly divorce step between me and you O my dear mother do I see you living Mine eyes smell onions I shall weep anon To PAROLLES Good Tom Drum lend me a handkercher So I thank thee Wait on me home I 'll make sport with thee let thy curtsies alone they are scurvy ones Let us from point to point this story know To make the even truth in pleasure flow To DIANA If thou beest yet a fresh uncropped flower Choose thou thy husband and I 'll pay thy dower For I can guess that by thy honest aid Thou kept'st a wife herself thyself a maid.- Of that and all the progress more and less Resolvedly more leisure shall express All yet seems well and if it end so meet The bitter past more welcome is the sweet Flourish The King 's a beggar now the play is done All is well ended if this suit be won That you express content which we will pay With strife to please you day exceeding day Ours be your patience then and yours our parts Your gentle hands lend us and take our hearts Nay but this dotage of our general 's O'erflows the measure Those his goodly eyes That o'er the files and musters of the war Have glow'd like plated Mars now bend now turn The office and devotion of their view Upon a tawny front His captain 's heart Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst The buckles on his breast reneges all temper And is become the bellows and the fan To cool a gipsy 's lust If it be love indeed tell me how much There 's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd I 'll set a bourn how far to be belov'd Then must thou needs find out new heaven new earth News my good lord from Rome Grates me the sum Nay hear them Antony Fulvia perchance is angry or who knows If the scarce bearded Caesar have not sent His pow'rful mandate to you ' Do this or this Take in that kingdom and enfranchise that Perform't or else we damn thee ' How my love Perchance Nay and most like You must not stay here longer your dismission Is come from Caesar therefore hear it Antony Where 's Fulvia 's process Caesar 's I would say Both Call in the messengers As I am Egypt 's Queen Thou blushest Antony and that blood of thine Is Caesar 's homager Else so thy cheek pays shame When shrill tongu'd Fulvia scolds The messengers Let Rome in Tiber melt and the wide arch Of the rang'd empire fall Here is my space Kingdoms are clay our dungy earth alike Feeds beast as man The nobleness of life Is to do thus emhracing when such a mutual pair And such a twain can do't in which I bind On pain of punishment the world to weet We stand up peerless Excellent falsehood Why did he marry Fulvia and not love her I 'll seem the fool I am not Antony Will be himself But stirr'd by Cleopatra Now for the love of Love and her soft hours Let 's not confound the time with conference harsh There 's not a minute of our lives should stretch Without some pleasure now What sport to night Hear the ambassadors Fie wrangling queen Whom everything becomes- to chide to laugh To weep whose every passion fully strives To make itself in thee fair and admir'd No messenger but thine and all alone To night we 'll wander through the streets and note The qualities of people Come my queen Last night you did desire it Speak not to us Is Caesar with Antonius priz'd so slight Sir sometimes when he is not Antony He comes too short of that great property Which still should go with Antony I am full sorry That he approves the common liar who Thus speaks of him at Rome but I will hope Of better deeds to morrow Rest you happy Exeunt Lord Alexas sweet Alexas most anything Alexas almost most absolute Alexas where 's the soothsayer that you prais'd so to th ' Queen O that I knew

him Good now some excellent fortune Let me be married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all Let me have a child at fifty to whom Herod of Jewry may do homage Find me to marry me with Octavius Caesar and companion me with my mistress You shall outlive the lady whom you serve O excellent I love long life better than figs You have seen and prov'd a fairer former fortune Than that which is to approach Then belike my children shall have no names Prithee how many boys and wenches must I have If every of your wishes had a womb And fertile every wish a million Out fool I forgive thee for a witch You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes Nay come tell Iras hers We 'll know all our fortunes Mine and most of our fortunes to night shall be- drunk to bed There 's a palm presages chastity if nothing else E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine Go you wild bedfellow you can not soothsay Nay if an oily palm be not a fruitful prognostication I can not scratch mine ear Prithee tell her but worky day fortune Your fortunes are alike But how but how Give me particulars I have said Am I not an inch of fortune better than she Well if you were but an inch of fortune better than I where would you choose it Not in my husband 's nose Our worser thoughts heavens mend Alexas- come his fortune his fortune O let him marry a woman that can not go sweet Isis I beseech thee And let her die too and give him a worse And let worse follow worse till the worst of all follow him laughing to his grave fiftyfold a cuckold Good Isis hear me this prayer though thou deny me a matter of more weight good Isis I beseech thee Amen Dear goddess hear that prayer of the people For as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man loose wiv'd so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a foul knave uncuckolded Therefore dear Isis keep decorum and fortune him accordingly Amen Lo now if it lay in their hands to make me a cuckold they would make themselves whores but they'ld do't Hush Here comes Antony Not he the Queen Saw you my lord No lady Was he not here No madam He was dispos'd to mirth but on the sudden A Roman thought hath struck him Enobarbus Madam Seek him and bring him hither Where 's Alexas Here at your service My lord approaches We will not look upon him Go with us Fulvia thy wife first came into the field Against my brother Lucius Ay But soon that war had end and the time 's state Made friends of them jointing their force ' gainst Caesar Whose better issue in the war from Italy Upon the first encounter drave them Well what worst The nature of bad news infects the teller When it concerns the fool or coward On Things that are past are done with me ' Tis thus Who tells me true though in his tale lie death I hear him as he flatter'd Labienus- This is stiff news- hath with his Parthian force Extended Asia from Euphrates His conquering banner shook from Syria To Lydia and to Ionia Whilst- Antony thou wouldst say O my lord Speak to me home mince not the general tongue Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome Rail thou in Fulvia 's phrase and taunt my faults With such full licence as both truth and malice Have power to utter O then we bring forth weeds When our quick minds lie still and our ills told us Is as our earing Fare thee well awhile At your noble pleasure Exit From Sicyon ho the news Speak there The man from Sicyon- is there such an one He stays upon your will Let him appear These strong Egyptian fetters I must break Or lose myself in dotage Fulvia thy wife is dead Where died she In Sicyon Her length of sickness with what else more serious Importeth thee to know this bears Gives the letter Forbear me Exit MESSENGER There 's a great spirit gone Thus did I desire it What our contempts doth often hurl from us We wish it ours again the present pleasure By revolution low'ring does become The opposite of itself She 's good being gone The hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on I must from this enchanting queen break off Ten thousand harms more than the ills I know My idleness doth hatch How now Enobarbus What 's your pleasure sir I must with haste from hence Why then we kill all our women We see how mortal an unkindness is to them if they suffer our departure death 's the word I must be gone Under a compelling occasion let women die It were pity to cast them away for nothing though between them and a great cause they should be esteemed nothing Cleopatra catching but the least noise of this dies instantly I have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment I do think there is mettle in death which commits some loving act upon her she hath such a celerity in dying She is cunning past man 's thought Alack sir no Her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love We can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report This can not be cunning in her if it be she makes a show'r of rain as well as Jove Would I had never seen her O Sir you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel Fulvia is dead Sir Fulvia is dead Fulvia Dead Why sir give the gods a thankful sacrifice When it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him it shows to man the tailors of the earth comforting therein that when old robes are worn out there are members to make new If there were no more women but Fulvia then had you indeed a cut and the case to be lamented This grief is crown'd with consolation your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow The business she hath broached in the state Can not endure my absence And the business you have broach'd here can not be without you especially that of Cleopatra 's which wholly depends on your abode No more light answers Let our officers Have notice what we purpose I shall break The cause of our expedience to the Queen And get her leave to part For not alone The death of Fulvia with more urgent touches Do strongly speak to us but the letters to Of many our contriving friends in Rome Petition us at home Sextus Pompeius Hath given the dare to Caesar and commands The empire of the sea our slippery people Whose love is never link'd to the deserver Till his deserts are past begin to throw Pompey the Great and all his dignities Upon his son who high in name and power Higher than both in blood and life stands up For the main soldier whose quality going on The sides o ' th ' world may danger Much is breeding Which like the courser 's hair hath yet but life And not a serpent 's poison Say our pleasure To such whose place is under us requires Our quick remove from hence I shall do't Exeunt Where is he I did not see him since See where he is who 's with him what he does I did not send you If you find him sad Say I am dancing if in mirth report That I am sudden sick Quick and return Exit ALEXAS Madam methinks if you did love him dearly You do not hold the method to enforce The like from him What should I do I do not In each thing give him way cross him in nothing Thou teachest like a fool- the way to lose him Tempt him not so too far I wish forbear In time we hate that which we often fear I am sick and sullen I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose- Help me away dear Charmian I shall fall It can not be thus long the sides of nature Will not sustain it Now my dearest queen- Pray you stand farther from me What 's the matter I know by that same eye there 's some good news What says the married woman You may go Would she had never given you leave to come Let her not say ' tis I that keep you here- I have no power upon you hers you are The gods best know- O never was there queen So mightily betray'd Yet at the first I saw the treasons planted Cleopatra- Why should I think you can be mine and true Though you in swearing shake the throned gods Who have been false to Fulvia Riotous madness To be entangled with those mouth made vows Which break themselves in swearing Most sweet queen- Nay pray you seek no colour for your going But bid farewell and go When you sued staying Then was the time for words No going then Eternity was in our lips and eyes Bliss in our brows ' bent none our parts so poor But was a race of heaven They are so still Or thou the greatest soldier of the world Art turn'd the greatest liar How now lady I would I had thy inches Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt Hear me queen The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile but my full heart Remains in use with you Our Italy Shines o'er with civil swords Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction the hated grown to strength Are newly grown to love The condemn'd Pompey Rich in his father 's honour creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state whose numbers threaten And quietness grown sick of rest would purge By any desperate change My more particular And that which most with you should safe my going Is Fulvia 's death Though age from folly could not give me freedom She 's dead my Queen Look here and at thy sovereign leisure read The garboils she awak'd At the last best See when and where she died O most false love Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill With sorrowful water Now I see I see In Fulvia 's death how mine receiv'd shall be Quarrel no more but be prepar'd to know The purposes I bear which are or cease As you shall give th ' advice By the fire That quickens Nilus ' slime I go from hence Thy soldier servant making peace or war As thou affects Cut my lace Charmian come But let it be I am quickly ill and well- So Antony loves My precious queen forbear And give true evidence to his love which stands An honourable trial So Fulvia told me I prithee turn aside and weep for her Then bid adieu to me and say the tears Belong to Egypt Good now play one scene Of excellent dissembling and let it look Like perfect honour You 'll heat my blood no more You can do better yet but this is meetly Now by my sword- And target Still he mends But this is not the best Look prithee Charmian How this Herculean Roman does become The carriage of his chafe I 'll leave you lady Courteous lord one word Sir you and I must part- but that 's not it Sir you and I have lov'd- but there 's not it That you know well Something it is I would- O my oblivion is a very Antony And I am all forgotten But that your royalty Holds idleness your subject I should take you For idleness itself ' Tis sweating labour To bear such idleness so near the heart As Cleopatra this But sir forgive me Since my becomings kill me when they do not Eye well to you Your honour calls you hence Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly And all the gods go with you Upon your sword Sit laurel victory and smooth success Be strew'd before your feet Let us go Come Our separation so abides and flies That thou residing here goes yet with me And I hence fleeting here remain with thee Away Exeunt You may see Lepidus and henceforth know It is not Caesar 's natural vice to hate Our great competitor From Alexandria This is the news he fishes drinks and wastes The lamps of night in revel is not more manlike Than Cleopatra nor the queen of Ptolemy More womanly than he hardly gave audience or Vouchsaf'd to think he had partners You shall find there A man who is the abstract of all faults That all men follow I must not think there are Evils enow to darken all his goodness His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven More fiery by night 's blackness hereditary Rather than purchas'd what he can not change Than what he chooses You are too indulgent Let 's grant it is not Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy To give a kingdom for a mirth to sit And keep the turn of tippling with a slave To reel the streets at noon and stand the buffet With knaves that smell of sweat Say this becomes him- As his composure must be rare indeed Whom these things can not blemish- yet must Antony No way excuse his foils when we do bear So great weight in his lightness If he fill'd His vacancy with his voluptuousness Full surfeits and the dryness of his bones Call on him for't But to confound such time That drums him from his sport and speaks as loud As his own state and ours- ' tis to be chid As we rate boys who being mature in knowledge Pawn their experience to their present pleasure And so rebel to judgment Here 's more news Thy biddings have been done and every hour Most noble Caesar shalt thou have report How ' tis abroad Pompey is strong at sea And it appears he is belov'd of those That only have fear'd Caesar To the ports The discontents repair and men 's reports Give him much wrong'd I should have known no less It hath been taught us from the primal state That he which is was wish'd until he were And the ebb'd man ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love Comes dear'd by being lack'd This common body Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream Goes to and back lackeying the varying tide To rot itself with motion Caesar I bring thee word Menecrates and Menas famous pirates Make the sea serve them which they ear and wound With keels of every kind Many hot inroads They make in Italy the borders maritime Lack blood to think on't and flush youth revolt No vessel can peep forth but ' tis as soon Taken as seen for Pompey 's name strikes more Than could his war resisted Antony Leave thy lascivious wassails When thou once Was beaten from Modena where thou slew'st Hirtius and Pansa consuls at thy heel Did famine follow whom thou fought'st against Though daintily brought up with patience more Than savages could suffer Thou didst drink The stale of horses and the gilded puddle Which beasts would cough at Thy palate then did deign The roughest berry on the rudest hedge Yea like the stag when snow the pasture sheets The barks of trees thou brows'd On the Alps It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh Which some did die to look on And all this- It wounds thine honour that I speak it now- Was borne so like a soldier that thy cheek So much as lank'd not ' Tis pity of him Let his shames quickly Drive him to Rome ' Tis time we twain Did show ourselves i ' th ' field and to that end Assemble we immediate council Pompey Thrives in our idleness To morrow Caesar I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly Both what by sea and land I can be able To front this present time Till which encounter It is my business too Farewell Farewell my lord What you shall know meantime Of stirs abroad I shall beseech you sir To let me be partaker Doubt not sir I knew it for my bond Exeunt Charmian Madam Ha ha Give me to drink mandragora Why madam That I might sleep out this great gap of time My Antony is away You think of him too much O ' tis treason Madam I trust not so Thou eunuch Mardian What 's your Highness ' pleasure Not now to hear thee sing I take no pleasure In aught an eunuch has ' Tis well for thee That being unseminar'd thy freer thoughts May not fly forth of Egypt Hast thou affections Yes gracious madam Indeed Not in deed madam for I can do nothing But what indeed is honest to be done Yet have I fierce affections and think What Venus did with Mars O Charmian Where think'st thou he is now Stands he or sits he Or does he walk or is he on his horse O happy horse to bear the weight of Antony Do bravely horse for wot'st thou whom thou mov'st The demi Atlas of this earth the arm And burgonet of men He 's speaking now Or murmuring ' Where 's my serpent of old Nile ' For so he calls me Now I feed myself With most delicious poison Think on me That am with Phoebus ' amorous pinches black And wrinkled deep in time Broad fronted Caesar When thou wast here above the ground I was A morsel for a monarch and great Pompey Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow There would he anchor his aspect and die With looking on his life Sovereign of Egypt hail How much unlike art thou Mark Antony Yet coming from him that great med'cine hath With his tinct gilded thee How goes it with my brave Mark Antony Last thing he did dear Queen He kiss'd- the last of many doubled kisses- This orient pearl His speech sticks in my heart Mine ear must pluck it thence ' Good friend ' quoth he ' Say the firm Roman to great Egypt sends This treasure of an oyster at whose foot To mend the petty present I will piece Her opulent throne with kingdoms All the East Say thou shall call her mistress ' So he nodded And soberly did mount an arm gaunt steed Who neigh'd so high that what I would have spoke Was beastly dumb'd by him What was he sad or merry Like to the time o ' th ' year between the extremes Of hot and cold he was nor sad nor merry O well divided disposition Note him Note him good Charmian ' tis the man but note him He was not sad for he would shine on those That make their looks by his he was not merry Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay In Egypt with his joy but between both O heavenly mingle Be'st thou sad or merry The violence of either thee becomes So does it no man else Met'st thou my posts Ay madam twenty several messengers Why do you send so thick Who 's born that day When I forget to send to Antony Shall die a beggar Ink and paper Charmian Welcome my good Alexas Did I Charmian Ever love Caesar so O that brave Caesar Be chok'd with such another emphasis Say ' the brave Antony ' The valiant Caesar By Isis I will give thee bloody teeth If thou with Caesar paragon again My man of men By your most gracious pardon I sing but after you My salad days When I was green in judgment cold in blood To say as I said then But come away Get me ink and paper He shall have every day a several greeting Or I 'll unpeople Egypt Exeunt If the great gods be just they shall assist The deeds of justest men Know worthy Pompey That what they do delay they not deny Whiles we are suitors to their throne decays The thing we sue for We ignorant of ourselves Beg often our own harms which the wise pow'rs Deny us for our good so find we profit By losing of our prayers I shall do well The people love me and the sea is mine My powers are crescent and my auguring hope Says it will come to th ' full Mark Antony In Egypt sits at dinner and will make No wars without doors Caesar gets money where He loses hearts Lepidus flatters both Of both is flatter'd but he neither loves Nor either cares for him Caesar and Lepidus Are in the field A mighty strength they carry Where have you this ' Tis false From Silvius sir He dreams I know they are in Rome together Looking for Antony But all the charms of love Salt Cleopatra soften thy wan'd lip Let witchcraft join with beauty lust with both Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts Keep his brain fuming Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour Even till a Lethe'd dullness- This is most certain that I shall deliver Mark Antony is every hour in Rome Expected Since he went from Egypt ' tis A space for farther travel I could have given less matter A better ear Menas I did not think This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm For such a petty war his soldiership Is twice the other twain But let us rear The higher our opinion that our stirring Can from the lap of Egypt 's widow pluck The ne'er lust wearied Antony I can not hope Caesar and Antony shall well greet together His wife that 's dead did trespasses to Caesar His brother warr'd upon him although I think Not mov'd by Antony I know not Menas How lesser enmities may give way to greater Were't not that we stand up against them all ' Twere pregnant they should square between themselves For they have entertained cause enough To draw their swords But how the fear of us May cement their divisions and bind up The petty difference we yet not know Be't as our gods will have't It only stands Our lives upon to use our strongest hands Come Menas Exeunt Good Enobarbus ' tis a worthy deed And shall become you well to entreat your captain To soft and gentle speech I shall entreat him To answer like himself If Caesar move him Let Antony look over Caesar 's head And speak as loud as Mars By Jupiter Were I the wearer of Antonius ' beard I would not shave't to day ' Tis not a time For private stomaching Every time Serves for the matter that is then born in't But small to greater matters must give way Not if the small come first Your speech is passion But pray you stir no embers up Here comes The noble Antony And yonder Caesar If we compose well here to Parthia Hark Ventidius I do not know Maecenas Ask Agrippa Noble friends That which combin'd us was most great and let not A leaner action rend us What 's amiss May it be gently heard When we debate Our trivial difference loud we do commit Murder in healing wounds Then noble partners The rather for I earnestly beseech Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms Nor curstness grow to th ' matter ' Tis spoken well Were we before our arinies and to fight I should do thus Flourish Welcome to Rome Thank you Sit Sit sir Nay then They sit I learn you take things ill which are not so Or being concern you not I must be laugh'd at If or for nothing or a little Should say myself offended and with you Chiefly i ' the world more laugh'd at that I should Once name you derogately when to sound your name It not concern'd me My being in Egypt Caesar What was't to you No more than my residing here at Rome Might be to you in Egypt Yet if you there Did practise on my state your being in Egypt Might be my question How intend you- practis'd You may be pleas'd to catch at mine intent By what did here befall me Your wife and brother Made wars upon me and their contestation Was theme for you you were the word of war You do mistake your business my brother never Did urge me in his act I did inquire it And have my learning from some true reports That drew their swords with you Did he not rather Discredit my authority with yours And make the wars alike against my stomach Having alike your cause Of this my letters Before did satisfy you If you 'll patch a quarrel As matter whole you have not to make it with It must not be with this You praise yourself By laying defects of judgment to me but You patch'd up your excuses Not so not so I know you could not lack I am certain on't Very necessity of this thought that I Your partner in the cause ' gainst which he fought Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars Which fronted mine own peace As for my wife I would you had her spirit in such another The third o ' th ' world is yours which with a snaffle You may pace easy but not such a wife Would we had all such wives that the men might go to wars with the women So much uncurbable her garboils Caesar Made out of her impatience- which not wanted Shrewdness of policy too- I grieving grant Did you too much disquiet For that you must But say I could not help it I wrote to you When rioting in Alexandria you Did pocket up my letters and with taunts Did gibe my missive out of audience Sir He fell upon me ere admitted Then Three kings I had newly feasted and did want Of what I was i ' th ' morning but next day I told him of myself which was as much As to have ask'd him pardon Let this fellow Be nothing of our strife if we contend Out of our question wipe him You have broken The article of your oath which you shall never Have tongue to charge me with Soft Caesar No Lepidus let him speak The honour is sacred which he talks on now Supposing that I lack'd it But on Caesar The article of my oath- To lend me arms and aid when I requir'd them The which you both denied Neglected rather And then when poisoned hours had bound me up From mine own knowledge As nearly as I may I 'll play the penitent to you but mine honesty Shall not make poor my greatness nor my power Work without it Truth is that Fulvia To have me out of Egypt made wars here For which myself the ignorant motive do So far ask pardon as befits mine honour To stoop in such a case ' Tis noble spoken If it might please you to enforce no further The griefs between ye- to forget them quite Were to remember that the present need Speaks to atone you Worthily spoken Maecenas Or if you borrow one another 's love for the instant you may when you hear no more words of Pompey return it again You shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do Thou art a soldier only Speak no more That truth should be silent I had almost forgot You wrong this presence therefore speak no more Go to then- your considerate stone I do not much dislike the matter but The manner of his speech for't can not be We shall remain in friendship our conditions So diff'ring in their acts Yet if I knew What hoop should hold us stanch from edge to edge O ' th ' world I would pursue it Give me leave Caesar Speak Agrippa Thou hast a sister by the mother 's side Admir'd Octavia Great Mark Antony Is now a widower Say not so Agrippa If Cleopatra heard you your reproof Were well deserv'd of rashness I am not married Caesar Let me hear Agrippa further speak To hold you in perpetual amity To make you brothers and to knit your hearts With an unslipping knot take Antony Octavia to his wife whose beauty claims No worse a husband than the best of men Whose virtue and whose general graces speak That which none else can utter By this marriage All little jealousies which now seem great And all great fears which now import their dangers Would then be nothing Truths would be tales Where now half tales be truths Her love to both Would each to other and all loves to both Draw after her Pardon what I have spoke For ' tis a studied not a present thought By duty ruminated Will Caesar speak Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd With what is spoke already What power is in Agrippa If I would say ' Agrippa be it so ' To make this good The power of Caesar and His power unto Octavia May I never To this good purpose that so fairly shows Dream of impediment Let me have thy hand Further this act of grace and from this hour The heart of brothers govern in our loves And sway our great designs There is my hand A sister I bequeath you whom no brother Did ever love so dearly Let her live To join our kingdoms and our hearts and never Fly off our loves again Happily amen I did not think to draw my sword ' gainst Pompey For he hath laid strange courtesies and great Of late upon me I must thank him only Lest my remembrance suffer ill report At heel of that defy him Time calls upon 's Of us must Pompey presently be sought Or else he seeks out us Where lies he About the Mount Misenum What is his strength by land Great and increasing but by sea He is an absolute master So is the fame Would we had spoke together Haste we for it Yet ere we put ourselves in arms dispatch we The business we have talk'd of With most gladness And do invite you to my sister 's view Whither straight I 'll lead you Let us Lepidus Not lack your company Noble Antony Not sickness should detain me Flourish Welcome from Egypt sir Half the heart of Caesar worthy Maecenas My honourable friend Agrippa Good Enobarbus We have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested You stay'd well by't in Egypt Ay sir we did sleep day out of countenance and made the night light with drinking Eight wild boars roasted whole at a breakfast and but twelve persons there Is this true This was but as a fly by an eagle We had much more monstrous matter of feast which worthily deserved noting She 's a most triumphant lady if report be square to her When she first met Mark Antony she purs'd up his heart upon the river of Cydnus There she appear'd indeed Or my reporter devis'd well for her I will tell you The barge she sat in like a burnish'd throne Burn'd on the water The poop was beaten gold Purple the sails and so perfumed that The winds were love sick with them the oars were silver Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke and made The water which they beat to follow faster As amorous of their strokes For her own person It beggar'd all description She did lie In her pavilion cloth of gold of tissue O'erpicturing that Venus where we see The fancy out work nature On each side her Stood pretty dimpled boys like smiling Cupids With divers colour'd fans whose wind did seem To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool And what they undid did O rare for Antony Her gentlewomen like the Nereides So many mermaids tended her i ' th ' eyes And made their bends adornings At the helm A seeming mermaid steers The silken tackle Swell with the touches of those flower soft hands That yarely frame the office From the barge A strange invisible perfume hits the sense Of the adjacent wharfs The city cast Her people out upon her and Antony Enthron'd i ' th ' market place did sit alone Whistling to th ' air which but for vacancy Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too And made a gap in nature Rare Egyptian Upon her landing Antony sent to her Invited her to supper She replied It should be better he became her guest Which she entreated Our courteous Antony Whom ne'er the word of ' No ' woman heard speak Being barber'd ten times o'er goes to the feast And for his ordinary pays his heart For what his eyes eat only Royal wench She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed He ploughed her and she cropp'd I saw her once Hop forty paces through the public street And having lost her breath she spoke and panted That she did make defect perfection And breathless pow'r breathe forth Now Antony must leave her utterly Never He will not Age can not wither her nor custom stale Her infinite variety Other women cloy The appetites they feed but she makes hungry Where most she satisfies for vilest things Become themselves in her that the holy priests Bless her when she is riggish If beauty wisdom modesty can settle The heart of Antony Octavia is A blessed lottery to him Let us go Good Enobarbus make yourself my guest Whilst you abide here Humbly sir I thank you Exeunt The world and my great office will sometimes Divide me from your bosom All which time Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers To them for you Good night sir My Octavia Read not my blemishes in the world 's report I have not kept my square but that to come Shall all be done by th ' rule Good night dear lady Good night sir Good night Exeunt CAESAR and OCTAVIA Now sirrah you do wish yourself in Egypt Would I had never come from thence nor you thither If you can- your reason I see it in my motion have it not in my tongue but yet hie you to Egypt again Say to me Whose fortunes shall rise higher Caesar 's or mine Caesar 's Therefore O Antony stay not by his side Thy daemon that thy spirit which keeps thee is Noble courageous high unmatchable Where Caesar 's is not but near him thy angel Becomes a fear as being o'erpow'r'd Therefore Make space enough between you Speak this no more To none but thee no more but when to thee If thou dost play with him at any game Thou art sure to lose and of that natural luck He beats thee ' gainst the odds Thy lustre thickens When he shines by I say again thy spirit Is all afraid to govern thee near him But he away ' tis noble Get thee gone Say to Ventidius I would speak with him Trouble yourselves no further Pray you hasten Your generals after Sir Mark Antony Will e'en but kiss Octavia and we 'll follow Till I shall see you in your soldier 's dress Which will become you both farewell We shall As I conceive the

angling when your diver Did hang a salt fish on his hook which he With fervency drew up That time O times I laughed him out of patience and that night I laugh'd him into patience and next morn Ere the ninth hour I drunk him to his bed Then put my tires and mantles on him whilst I wore his sword Philippan Madam madam- Antony 's dead If thou say so villain Thou kill'st thy mistress but well and free If thou so yield him there is gold and here My bluest veins to kiss- a hand that kings Have lipp'd and trembled kissing First madam he is well Why there 's more gold But sirrah mark we use To say the dead are well Bring it to that The gold I give thee will I melt and pour Down thy ill uttering throat Good madam hear me Well go to I will But there 's no goodness in thy face If Antony Be free and healthful- why so tart a favour To trumpet such good tidings If not well Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes Not like a formal man Will't please you hear me I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st Yet if thou say Antony lives is well Or friends with Caesar or not captive to him I 'll set thee in a shower of gold and hail Rich pearls upon thee Madam he 's well Well said And friends with Caesar Th'art an honest man Caesar and he are greater friends than ever Make thee a fortune from me But yet madam- I do not like ' but yet ' It does allay The good precedence fie upon '

health thou say'st and thou say'st free Free madam No I made no such report He 's bound unto Octavia For what good turn For the best turn i ' th ' bed I am pale Charmian Madam he 's married to Octavia The most infectious pestilence upon thee Good madam patience What say you Hence Strikes him Horrible villain or I 'll spurn thine eyes Like balls before me I 'll unhair thy head Gracious madam I that

what gift beside Thy modesty can beg He 's married madam Rogue thou hast liv'd too long Draws a knife Nay then I 'll run What mean you madam I have made no fault Exit Good madam keep yourself within yourself The man is innocent Some innocents scape not the thunderbolt Melt Egypt into Nile and kindly creatures Turn all to serpents Call the slave again Though I am mad I will not bite him Call He is afear'd to come I will not hurt him These hands do lack nobility that they strike A meaner than myself since I myself Have given myself the cause I have done my duty Is he married I can not hate thee

Many times madam I am paid for't now Lead me from hence I faint O Iras Charmian ' Tis no matter Go to the fellow good Alexas bid him Report the feature of Octavia her years Her inclination let him not leave out The colour of her hair Bring me word quickly Your hostages I have so have you mine And we shall talk before we fight Most meet That first we come to words and therefore have we Our written purposes before us sent Which if thou hast considered let us know If ' twill tie up thy discontented sword And carry back to Sicily much tall youth That else must perish here To you all three The senators alone of this great world Chief factors for the gods I do not know Wherefore my father should revengers want Having a son and friends since Julius Caesar Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted There saw you labouring for him What was't That mov'd pale Cassius to conspire and what Made the all honour'd honest Roman Brutus With the arm'd rest courtiers of beauteous freedom To drench the Capitol but that they would Have one man but a man And that is it Hath made me rig my navy at whose burden The anger'd ocean foams with which I meant To scourge th ' ingratitude that despiteful Rome Cast on my noble father Take your time Thou canst not fear us Pompey with thy sails We 'll speak with thee at sea at land thou know'st How much we do o'er count thee At land indeed Thou dost o'er count me of my father 's house But since the cuckoo builds not for himself Remain in't as thou mayst Be pleas'd to tell us- For this is from the present- how you take The offers we have sent you There 's the point Which do not be entreated to but weigh What it is worth embrac'd And what may follow To try a larger fortune You have made me offer Of Sicily Sardinia and I must Rid all the sea of pirates then to send Measures of wheat to Rome this ' greed upon To part with unhack'd edges and bear back Our targes undinted That 's our offer Know then I came before you here a man prepar'd To take this offer but Mark Antony Put me to some impatience Though I lose The praise of it by telling you must know When Caesar and your brother were at blows Your mother came to Sicily and did find Her welcome friendly I have heard it Pompey And am well studied for a liberal thanks Which I do owe you Let me have your hand I did not think sir to have met you here The beds i ' th ' East are soft and thanks to you That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither For I have gained by't Since I saw you last There is a change upon you Well I know not What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face But in my bosom shall she never come To make my heart her vassal Well met here I hope so Lepidus Thus we are agreed I crave our composition may be written And seal'd between us That 's the next to do We 'll feast each other ere we part and let 's Draw lots who shall begin That will I Pompey No Antony take the lot But first or last your fine Egyptian cookery Shall have the fame I have heard that Julius Caesar Grew fat with feasting there You have heard much I have fair meanings sir And fair words to them Then so much have I heard And I have heard Apollodorus carried- No more of that He did so What I pray you A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress I know thee now How far'st thou soldier Well And well am like to do for I perceive Four feasts are toward Let me shake thy hand I never hated thee I have seen thee fight When I have envied thy behaviour Sir I never lov'd you much but I ha ' prais'd ye When you have well deserv'd ten times as much As I have said you did Enjoy thy plainness It nothing ill becomes thee Aboard my galley I invite you all Will you lead lords Show 's the way sir Come Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS and MENAS Aside Thy father Pompey would ne'er have made this treaty.- You and I have known sir At sea I think We have sir You have done well by water And you by land I Will praise any man that will praise me though it can not be denied what I have done by land Nor what I have done by water Yes something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea And you by land There I deny my land service But give me your hand Menas if our eyes had authority here they might take two thieves kissing All men 's faces are true whatsome'er their hands are But there is never a fair woman has a true face No slander they steal hearts We came hither to fight with you For my part I am sorry it is turn'd to a drinking Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune If he do sure he can not weep't back again Y'have said sir We look'd not for Mark Antony here Pray you is he married to Cleopatra Caesar ' sister is call'd Octavia True sir she was the wife of Caius Marcellus But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius Pray ye sir ' Tis true Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together If I were bound to divine of this unity I would not prophesy so I think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties I think so too But you shall find the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity Octavia is of a holy cold and still conversation Who would not have his wife so Not he that himself is not so which is Mark Antony He will to his Egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar and as I said before that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance Antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here And thus it may be Come sir will you aboard I have a health for you I shall take it sir We have us'd our throats in Egypt Come let 's away Exeunt Here they 'll be man Some o ' their plants are ill rooted already the least wind i ' th ' world will blow them down Lepidus is high colour'd They have made him drink alms drink As they pinch one another by the disposition he cries out ' No more ' reconciles them to his entreaty and himself to th ' drink But it raises the greater war between him and his discretion Why this it is to have a name in great men 's fellowship I had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partizan I could not heave To be call'd into a huge sphere and not to be seen to move in't are the holes where eyes should be which pitifully disaster the cheeks To CAESAR Thus do they sir they take the flow o ' th ' Y'have strange serpents there Ay Lepidus Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile They are so Sit- and some wine A health to Lepidus I am not so well as I should be but I 'll ne'er out Not till you have slept I fear me you 'll be in till then Nay certainly I have heard the Ptolemies ' pyramises are very goodly things Without contradiction I have heard that Aside to POMPEY Pompey a word Aside to MENAS Say in mine ear what is't Aside to POMPEY Forsake thy seat I do beseech thee Whispers in 's ear Forbear me till anon- This wine for Lepidus What manner o ' thing is your crocodile It is shap'd sir like itself and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is and moves with it own organs It lives by that which nourisheth it and the elements once out of it it transmigrates What colour is it of Of it own colour too ' Tis a strange serpent ' Tis so And the tears of it are wet Will this description satisfy him With the health that Pompey gives him else he is a very epicure Aside to MENAS Go hang sir hang Tell me of that Aside to POMPEY If for the sake of merit thou wilt hear Aside to MENAS I think th'art mad Rises and walks aside The matter I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes Thou hast serv'd me with much faith What 's else to say?- Be jolly lords These quicksands Lepidus Keep off them for you sink Wilt thou be lord of all the world What say'st thou Wilt thou be lord of the whole world That 's twice How should that be But entertain it And though you think me poor I am the man Will give thee all the world Hast thou drunk well No Pompey I have kept me from the cup Thou art if thou dar'st be the earthly Jove Whate'er the ocean pales or sky inclips Is thine if thou wilt ha't Show me which way These three world sharers these competitors Are in thy vessel Let me cut the cable And when we are put off fall to their throats All there is thine Ah this thou shouldst have done And not have spoke on't In me ' tis villainy In thee't had been good service Thou must know ' Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour Mine honour it Repent that e'er thy tongue Hath so betray'd thine act Being done unknown I should have found it afterwards well done But must condemn it now Desist and drink Aside For this I 'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more Who seeks and will not take when once ' tis offer'd Shall never find it more This health to Lepidus Bear him ashore I 'll pledge it for him Pompey Here 's to thee Menas Enobarbus welcome Fill till the cup be hid There 's a strong fellow Menas Why ' A bears the third part of the world man see'st not The third part then is drunk Would it were all That it might go on wheels Drink thou increase the reels Come This is not yet an Alexandrian feast It ripens towards it Strike the vessels ho Here 's to Caesar I could well forbear't It 's monstrous labour when I wash my brain And it grows fouler Be a child o ' th ' time Possess it I 'll make answer But I had rather fast from all four days Than drink so much in one To ANTONY Ha my brave emperor Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals And celebrate our drink Let 's ha't good soldier Come let 's all take hands Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense In soft and delicate Lethe All take hands Make battery to our ears with the loud music The while I 'll place you then the boy shall sing The holding every man shall bear as loud As his strong sides can volley What would you more Pompey good night Good brother Let me request you off our graver business Frowns at this levity Gentle lords let 's part You see we have burnt our cheeks Strong Enobarb Is weaker than the wine and mine own tongue Splits what it speaks The wild disguise hath almost Antick'd us all What needs more words Good night Good Antony your hand I 'll try you on the shore And shall sir Give 's your hand O Antony You have my father 's house- but what We are friends Come down into the boat Take heed you fall not No to my cabin These drums these trumpets flutes what Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell To these great fellows Sound and be hang'd sound out Hoo says ' a.

Thy Pacorus Orodes Pays this for Marcus Crassus Noble Ventidius Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm The fugitive Parthians follow spur through Media Mesopotamia and the shelters whither The routed fly So thy grand captain Antony Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and Put garlands on thy head O Silius Silius I have done enough A lower place note well May make too great an act for learn this Silius Better to leave undone than by our deed Acquire too high a fame when him we serve 's away Caesar and Antony have ever won More in their officer than person Sossius One of my place in Syria his lieutenant For quick accumulation of renown Which he achiev'd by th ' minute lost his favour Who does i ' th ' wars more than his captain can Becomes his captain 's captain and ambition The soldier 's virtue rather makes choice of loss Than gain which darkens him I could do more to do Antonius good But ' twould offend him and in his offence Should my performance perish Thou hast Ventidius that Without the which a soldier and his sword Grants scarce distinction Thou wilt write to Antony I 'll humbly signify what in his name That magical word of war we have effected How with his banners and his well paid ranks The ne'er yet beaten horse of Parthia We have jaded out o ' th ' field Where is he now He purposeth to Athens whither with what haste The weight we must convey with 's will permit We shall appear before him.- On there pass along What are the brothers parted They have dispatch'd with Pompey he is gone The other three are sealing Octavia weeps To part from Rome Caesar is sad and Lepidus Since Pompey 's feast as Menas says is troubled With the green sickness ' Tis a noble Lepidus A very fine one O how he loves Caesar Nay but how dearly he adores Mark Antony Caesar Why he 's the Jupiter of men What 's Antony The god of Jupiter Spake you of Caesar How the nonpareil O Antony O thou Arabian bird Would you praise Caesar say ' Caesar'- go no further Indeed he plied them both with excellent praises But he loves Caesar best Yet he loves Antony Hoo hearts tongues figures scribes bards poets can not Think speak cast write sing number- hoo!- His love to Antony But as for Caesar Kneel down kneel down and wonder Both he loves They are his shards and he their beetle Trumpets Good fortune worthy soldier and farewell No further sir You take from me a great part of myself Use me well in't Sister prove such a wife As my thoughts make thee and as my farthest band Shall pass on thy approof Most noble Antony Let not the piece of virtue which is set Betwixt us as the cement of our love To keep it builded be the ram to batter The fortress of it for better might we Have lov'd without this mean if on both parts This be not cherish'd Make me not offended In your distrust I have said You shall not find Though you be therein curious the least cause For what you seem to fear So the gods keep you And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends We will here part Farewell my dearest sister fare thee well The elements be kind to thee and make Thy spirits all of comfort Fare thee well My noble brother The April 's in her eyes It is love 's spring And these the showers to bring it on Be cheerful Sir look well to my husband 's house and- What Octavia I 'll tell you in your ear Her tongue will not obey her heart nor can Her heart inform her tongue- the swan 's down feather That stands upon the swell at the full of tide And neither way inclines Aside to AGRIPPA Will Caesar weep Aside to ENOBARBUS He has a cloud in 's face Aside to AGRIPPA He were the worse for that were he a Aside to ENOBARBUS Why Enobarbus When Antony found Julius Caesar dead He cried almost to roaring and he wept When at Philippi he found Brutus slain Aside to AGRIPPA That year indeed he was troubled No sweet Octavia You shall hear from me still the time shall not Out go my thinking on you Come sir come I 'll wrestle with you in my strength of love Look here I have you thus I let you go And give you to the gods Adieu be happy Let all the number of the stars give light To thy fair way Farewell farewell Kisses OCTAVIA Farewell Trumpets sound Exeunt Where is the fellow Half afeard to come Go to go to Good Majesty Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you But when you are well pleas'd That Herod 's head I 'll have But how when Antony is gone Through whom I might command it Come thou near Most gracious Majesty Didst thou behold Octavia Ay dread Queen Where Madam in Rome I look'd her in the face and saw her led Between her brother and Mark Antony Is she as tall as me She is not madam Didst hear her speak Is she shrill tongu'd or low Madam I heard her speak she is low voic'd That 's not so good He can not like her long Like her O Isis ' tis impossible I think so Charmian Dull of tongue and dwarfish What majesty is in her gait Remember If e'er thou look'dst on majesty She creeps Her motion and her station are as one She shows a body rather than a life A statue than a breather Is this certain Or I have no observance Three in Egypt Can not make better note He 's very knowing I do perceive't There 's nothing in her yet The fellow has good judgment Excellent Guess at her years I prithee Madam She was a widow Widow Charmian hark And I do think she 's thirty Bear'st thou her face in mind Is't long or round Round even to faultiness For the most part too they are foolish that are so Her hair what colour Brown madam and her forehead As low as she would wish it There 's gold for thee Thou must not take my former sharpness ill I will employ thee back again I find thee Most fit for business Go make thee ready Our letters are prepar'd Exeunt MESSENGER A proper man Indeed he is so I repent me much That so I harried him Why methinks by him This creature 's no such thing Nothing madam The man hath seen some majesty and should know Hath he seen majesty Isis else defend And serving you so long I have one thing more to ask him yet good Charmian But ' tis no matter thou shalt bring him to me Where I will write All may be well enough I warrant you madam Exeunt Nay nay Octavia not only that- That were excusable that and thousands more Of semblable import- but he hath wag'd New wars ' gainst Pompey made his will and read it To public ear Spoke scandy of me when perforce he could not But pay me terms of honour cold and sickly He vented them most narrow measure lent me When the best hint was given him he not took't Or did it from his teeth O my good lord Believe not all or if you must believe Stomach not all A more unhappy lady If this division chance ne'er stood between Praying for both parts The good gods will mock me presently When I shall pray ' O bless my lord and husband ' Undo that prayer by crying out as loud ' O bless my brother ' Husband win win brother Prays and destroys the prayer no mid way ' Twixt these extremes at all Gentle Octavia Let your best love draw to that point which seeks Best to preserve it If I lose mine honour I lose myself better I were not yours Than yours so branchless But as you requested Yourself shall go between 's The meantime lady I 'll raise the preparation of a war Shall stain your brother Make your soonest haste So your desires are yours Thanks to my lord The Jove of power make me most weak most weak Your reconciler Wars ' twixt you twain would be As if the world should cleave and that slain men Should solder up the rift When it appears to you where this begins Turn your displeasure that way for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them Provide your going Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to Exeunt How now friend Eros There 's strange news come sir What man Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey This is old What is the success Caesar having made use of him in the wars ' gainst Pompey presently denied him rivality would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to Pompey upon his own appeal seizes him So the poor third is up till death enlarge his confine Then world thou hast a pair of chaps- no more And throw between them all the food thou hast They 'll grind the one the other Where 's Antony He 's walking in the garden- thus and spurns The rush that lies before him cries ' Fool Lepidus ' And threats the throat of that his officer That murd'red Pompey Our great navy 's rigg'd For Italy and Caesar More Domitius My lord desires you presently my news I might have told hereafter ' Twill be naught But let it be Bring me to Antony Come sir Exeunt Contemning Rome he has done all this and more In Alexandria Here 's the manner of't I ' th ' market place on a tribunal silver'd Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold Were publicly enthron'd at the feet sat Caesarion whom they call my father 's son And all the unlawful issue that their lust Since then hath made between them Unto her He gave the stablishment of Egypt made her Of lower Syria Cyprus Lydia Absolute queen This in the public eye I ' th ' common show place where they exercise His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings Great Media Parthia and Armenia He gave to Alexander to Ptolemy he assign'd Syria Cilicia and Phoenicia She In th ' habiliments of the goddess Isis That day appear'd and oft before gave audience As ' tis reported so Let Rome be thus Inform'd Who queasy with his insolence Already will their good thoughts call from him The people knows it and have now receiv'd His accusations Who does he accuse Caesar and that having in Sicily Sextus Pompeius spoil'd we had not rated him His part o ' th ' isle Then does he say he lent me Some shipping unrestor'd Lastly he frets That Lepidus of the triumvirate Should be depos'd and being that we detain All his revenue Sir this should be answer'd ' Tis done already and messenger gone I have told him Lepidus was grown too cruel That he his high authority abus'd And did deserve his change For what I have conquer'd I grant him part but then in his Armenia And other of his conquer'd kingdoms Demand the like He 'll never yield to that Nor must not then be yielded to in this Hail Caesar and my lord hail most dear Caesar That ever I should call thee cast away You have not call'd me so nor have you cause Why have you stol'n upon us thus You come not Like Caesar 's sister The wife of Antony Should have an army for an usher and The neighs of horse to tell of her approach Long ere she did appear The trees by th ' way Should have borne men and expectation fainted Longing for what it had not Nay the dust Should have ascended to the roof of heaven Rais'd by your populous troops But you are come A market maid to Rome and have prevented The ostentation of our love which left unshown Is often left unlov'd We should have met you By sea and land supplying every stage With an augmented greeting Good my lord To come thus was I not constrain'd but did it On my free will My lord Mark Antony Hearing that you prepar'd for war acquainted My grieved ear withal whereon I begg'd His pardon for return Which soon he granted Being an obstruct ' tween his lust and him Do not say so my lord I have eyes upon him And his affairs come to me on the wind Where is he now My lord in Athens No my most wronged sister Cleopatra Hath nodded him to her He hath given his empire Up to a whore who now are levying The kings o ' th ' earth for war He hath assembled Bocchus the king of Libya Archelaus Of Cappadocia Philadelphos king Of Paphlagonia the Thracian king Adallas King Manchus of Arabia King of Pont Herod of Jewry Mithridates king Of Comagene Polemon and Amyntas The kings of Mede and Lycaonia with More larger list of sceptres Ay me most wretched That have my heart parted betwixt two friends That does afflict each other Welcome hither Your letters did withhold our breaking forth Till we perceiv'd both how you were wrong led And we in negligent danger Cheer your heart Be you not troubled with the time which drives O'er your content these strong necessities But let determin'd things to destiny Hold unbewail'd their way Welcome to Rome Nothing more dear to me You are abus'd Beyond the mark of thought and the high gods To do you justice make their ministers Of us and those that love you Best of comfort And ever welcome to us Welcome lady Welcome dear madam Each heart in Rome does love and pity you Only th ' adulterous Antony most large In his abominations turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us Is it so sir Most certain Sister welcome Pray you Be ever known to patience My dear'st sister Exeunt I will be even with thee doubt it not But why why Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars And say'st it is not fit Well is it is it Is't not denounc'd against us Why should not we Be there in person Aside Well I could reply If we should serve with horse and mares together The horse were merely lost the mares would bear A soldier and his horse What is't you say Your presence needs must puzzle Antony Take from his heart take from his brain from 's time What should not then be spar'd He is already Traduc'd for levity and ' tis said in Rome That Photinus an eunuch and your maids Manage this war Sink Rome and their tongues rot That speak against us A charge we bear i ' th ' war And as the president of my kingdom will Appear there for a man Speak not against it I will not stay behind Nay I have done Here comes the Emperor Is it not strange Canidius That from Tarentum and Brundusium He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea And take in Toryne?- You have heard on't sweet Celerity is never more admir'd Than by the negligent A good rebuke Which might have well becom'd the best of men To taunt at slackness Canidius we Will fight with him by sea By sea What else Why will my lord do so For that he dares us to't So hath my lord dar'd him to single fight Ay and to wage this battle at Pharsalia Where Caesar fought with Pompey But these offers Which serve not for his vantage he shakes off And so should you Your ships are not well mann'd Your mariners are muleteers reapers people Ingross'd by swift impress In Caesar 's fleet Are those that often have ' gainst Pompey fought Their ships are yare yours heavy No disgrace Shall fall you for refusing him at sea Being prepar'd for land By sea by sea Most worthy sir you therein throw away The absolute soldiership you have by land Distract your army which doth most consist Of war mark'd footmen leave unexecuted Your own renowned knowledge quite forgo The way which promises assurance and Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard From firm security I 'll fight at sea I have sixty sails Caesar none better Our overplus of shipping will we burn And with the rest full mann'd from th ' head of Actium Beat th ' approaching Caesar But if we fail We then can do't at land The news is true my lord he is descried Caesar has taken Toryne Can he be there in person ' Tis impossible- Strange that his power should be Canidius Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land And our twelve thousand horse We 'll to our ship Away my Thetis O noble Emperor do not fight by sea Trust not to rotten planks Do you misdoubt This sword and these my wounds Let th ' Egyptians And the Phoenicians go a ducking we Have us'd to conquer standing on the earth And fighting foot to foot Well well- away By Hercules I think I am i ' th ' right Soldier thou art but his whole action grows Not in the power on't So our leader 's led And we are women 's men You keep by land The legions and the horse whole do you not Marcus Octavius Marcus Justeius Publicola and Caelius are for sea But we keep whole by land This speed of Caesar 's Carries beyond belief While he was yet in Rome His power went out in such distractions as Beguil'd all spies Who 's his lieutenant hear you They say one Taurus Well I know the man The Emperor calls Canidius With news the time 's with labour and throes forth Each minute some Exeunt Taurus My lord Strike not by land keep whole provoke not battle Till we have done at sea Do not exceed The prescript of this scroll Our fortune lies Upon this jump Exeunt Set we our squadrons on yon side o ' th ' hill In eye of Caesar 's battle from which place We may the number of the ships behold And so proceed accordingly Exeunt Naught naught all naught I can behold no longer Th ' Antoniad the Egyptian admiral With all their sixty fly and turn the rudder To see't mine eyes are blasted Gods and goddesses All the whole synod of them What 's thy passion The greater cantle of the world is lost With very ignorance we have kiss'd away Kingdoms and provinces How appears the fight On our side like the token'd pestilence Where death is sure Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt- Whom leprosy o'ertake!- i ' th ' midst o ' th ' fight When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd Both as the same or rather ours the elder- The breese upon her like a cow in June- Hoists sails and flies That I beheld Mine eyes did sicken at the sight and could not Endure a further view She once being loof'd The noble ruin of her magic Antony Claps on his sea wing and like a doting mallard Leaving the fight in height flies after her I never saw an action of such shame Experience manhood honour ne'er before Did violate so itself Alack alack Our fortune on the sea is out of breath And sinks most lamentably Had our general Been what he knew himself it had gone well O he has given example for our flight Most grossly by his own Ay are you thereabouts Why then good night indeed Toward Peloponnesus are they fled ' Tis easy to't and there I will attend What further comes To Caesar will I render My legions and my horse six kings already Show me the way of yielding I 'll yet follow The wounded chance of Antony though my reason Sits in the wind against me Exeunt Hark the land bids me tread no more upon't It is asham'd to bear me Friends come hither I am so lated in the world that I Have lost my way for ever I have a ship Laden with gold take that divide it Fly And make your peace with Caesar Fly Not we I have fled myself and have instructed cowards To run and show their shoulders Friends be gone I have myself resolv'd upon a course Which has no need of you be gone My treasure 's in the harbour take it O I follow'd that I blush to look upon My very hairs do mutiny for the white Reprove the brown for rashness and they them For fear and doting Friends be gone you shall Have letters from me to some friends that will Sweep your way for you Pray you look not sad Nor make replies of loathness take the hint Which my despair proclaims Let that be left Which leaves itself To the sea side straight way I will possess you of that ship and treasure Leave me I pray a little pray you now Nay do so for indeed I have lost command Therefore I pray you I 'll see you by and by Sits down Nay gentle madam to him Comfort him Do most dear Queen Do Why what else Let me sit down O Juno No no no no no See you here sir O fie fie fie Madam Madam O good Empress Sir sir Yes my lord yes He at Philippi kept His sword e'en like a dancer while I struck The lean and wrinkled Cassius and ' twas I That the mad Brutus ended he alone Dealt on lieutenantry and no practice had In the brave squares of war Yet now- no matter Ah stand by The Queen my lord the Queen Go to him madam speak to him He is unqualitied with very shame Well then sustain me O I have offended reputation- A most unnoble swerving Sir the Queen O whither hast thou led me Egypt See How I convey my shame out of thine eyes By looking back what I have left behind ' Stroy'd in dishonour O my lord my lord Forgive my fearful sails I little thought You would have followed Egypt thou knew'st too well My heart was to thy rudder tied by th ' strings And thou shouldst tow me after O'er my spirit Thy full supremacy thou knew'st and that Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods Command me O my pardon Now I must To the young man send humble treaties dodge And palter in the shifts of lowness who With half the bulk o ' th ' world play'd as I pleas'd Making and marring fortunes You did know How much you were my conqueror and that My sword made weak by my affection would Obey it on all cause Pardon pardon Fall not a tear I say one of them rates All that is won and lost Give me a kiss Even this repays me We sent our schoolmaster is ' a come back Love I am full of lead Some wine Within there and our viands Fortune knows We scorn her most when most she offers blows Exeunt Let him appear that 's come from Antony Know you him Caesar ' tis his schoolmaster An argument that he is pluck'd when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing Which had superfluous kings for messengers Not many moons gone by Approach and speak Such as I am I come from Antony I was of late as petty to his ends As is the morn dew on the myrtle leaf To his grand sea Be't so Declare thine office Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee and Requires to live in Egypt which not granted He lessens his requests and to thee sues To let him breathe between the heavens and earth A private man in Athens This for him Next Cleopatra does confess thy greatness Submits her to thy might and of thee craves The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs Now hazarded to thy grace For Antony I have no ears to his request The Queen Of audience nor desire shall fail so she From Egypt drive her all disgraced friend Or take his life there This if she perform She shall not sue unheard So to them both Fortune pursue thee Bring him through the bands Exit EUPHRONIUS To THYREUS To try thy eloquence now ' tis time Dispatch From Antony win Cleopatra Promise And in our name what she requires add more From thine invention offers Women are not In their best fortunes strong but want will perjure The ne'er touch'd vestal Try thy cunning Thyreus Make thine own edict for thy pains which we Will answer as a law Caesar I go Observe how Antony becomes his flaw And what thou think'st his very action speaks In every power that moves Caesar I shall Exeunt What shall we do Enobarbus Think and die Is Antony or we in fault for this Antony only that would make his will Lord of his reason What though you fled From that great face of war whose several ranges Frighted each other Why should he follow The itch of his affection should not then Have nick'd his captainship at such a point When half to half the world oppos'd he being The mered question ' Twas a shame no less Than was his loss to course your flying flags And leave his navy gazing Prithee peace Is that his answer Ay my lord The Queen shall then have courtesy so she Will yield us up He says so Let her know't To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head And he will fill thy wishes to the brim With principalities That head my lord To him again Tell him he wears the rose Of youth upon him from which the world should note Something particular His coin ships legions May be a coward 's whose ministers would prevail Under the service of a child as soon As i ' th ' command of Caesar I dare him therefore To lay his gay comparisons apart And answer me declin'd sword against sword Ourselves alone I 'll write it Follow me Aside Yes like enough high battled Caesar will Unstate his happiness and be stag'd to th ' show Against a sworder I see men 's judgments are A parcel of their fortunes and things outward Do draw the inward quality after them To suffer all alike That he should dream Knowing all measures the full Caesar will Answer his emptiness Caesar thou hast subdu'd His judgment too A messenger from Caesar What no more ceremony See my women Against the blown rose may they stop their nose That kneel'd unto the buds Admit him sir Exit SERVANT Aside Mine honesty and I begin to square The loyalty well held to fools does make Our faith mere folly Yet he that can endure To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord Does conquer him that did his master conquer And earns a place i ' th ' story Caesar 's will Hear it apart None but friends say boldly So haply are they friends to Antony He needs as many sir as Caesar has Or needs not us If Caesar please our master Will leap to be his friend For us you know Whose he is we are and that is Caesar 's So Thus then thou most renown'd Caesar entreats Not to consider in what case thou stand'st Further than he is Caesar Go on Right royal He knows that you embrace not Antony As you did love but as you fear'd him O The scars upon your honour therefore he Does pity as constrained blemishes Not as deserv'd He is a god and knows What is most right Mine honour was not yielded But conquer'd merely Aside To be sure of that I will ask Antony Sir sir thou art so leaky That we must leave thee to thy sinking for Thy dearest quit thee Exit Shall I say to Caesar What you require of him For he partly begs To be desir'd to give It much would please him That of his fortunes you should make a staff To lean upon But it would warm his spirits To hear from me you had left Antony And put yourself under his shroud The universal landlord What 's your name My name is Thyreus Most kind messenger Say to great Caesar this in deputation I kiss his conquring hand Tell him I am prompt To lay my crown at 's feet and there to kneel Tell him from his all obeying breath I hear The doom of Egypt ' Tis your noblest course Wisdom and fortune combating together If that the former dare but what it can No chance may shake it Give me grace to lay My duty on your hand Your Caesar 's father oft When he hath mus'd of taking kingdoms in Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place As it rain'd kisses Favours by Jove that thunders What art thou fellow One that but performs The bidding of the fullest man and worthiest To have command obey'd Aside You will be whipt Approach there.- Ah you kite!- Now gods and devils Authority melts from me Of late when I cried ' Ho ' Like boys unto a muss kings would start forth And cry ' Your will ' Have you no ears I am Antony yet ' Tis better playing with a lion 's whelp Than with an old one dying Moon and stars Whip him Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries That do acknowledge Caesar should I find them So saucy with the hand of she here- what 's her name Since she was Cleopatra Whip him fellows Till like a boy you see him cringe his face And whine aloud for mercy Take him hence Mark Antony- Tug him away Being whipt Bring him again the Jack of Caesar 's shall Bear us an errand to him Exeunt servants with THYREUS You were half blasted ere I knew you Ha Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome Forborne the getting of a lawful race And by a gem of women to be abus'd By one that looks on feeders Good my lord- You have been a boggler ever But when we in our viciousness grow hard- O misery on't!- the wise gods seel our eyes In our own filth drop our clear judgments make us Adore our errors laugh at 's while we strut To our confusion O is't come to this I found you as a morsel cold upon Dead Caesar 's trencher Nay you were a fragment Of Cneius Pompey 's besides what hotter hours Unregist'red in vulgar fame you have Luxuriously pick'd out for I am sure Though you can guess what temperance should be You know not what it is Wherefore is this To let a fellow that will take rewards And say ' God quit you ' be familiar with My playfellow your hand this kingly seal And plighter of high hearts O that I were Upon the hill of Basan to outroar The horned herd For I have savage cause And to proclaim it civilly were like A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank For being yare about him Soundly my lord Cried he and begg'd ' a pardon He did ask favour If that thy father live let him repent Thou wast not made his daughter and be thou sorry To follow Caesar in his triumph since Thou hast been whipt for following him Henceforth The white hand of a lady fever thee Shake thou to look on't Get thee back to Caesar Tell him thy entertainment look thou say He makes me angry with him for he seems Proud and disdainful harping on what I am Not what he knew I was He makes me angry And at this time most easy ' tis to do't When my good stars that were my former guides Have empty left their orbs and shot their fires Into th ' abysm of hell If he mislike My speech and what is done tell him he has Hipparchus my enfranched bondman whom He may at pleasure whip or hang or torture As he shall like to quit me Urge it thou Hence with thy stripes be gone Exit THYREUS Have you done yet Alack our terrene moon Is now eclips'd and it portends alone The fall of Antony I must stay his time To flatter Caesar would you mingle eyes With one that ties his points Not know me yet Cold hearted toward me Ah dear if I be so From my cold heart let heaven engender hail And poison it in the source and the first stone Drop in my neck as it determines so Dissolve my life The next Caesarion smite Till by degrees the memory of my womb Together with my brave Egyptians all By the discandying of this pelleted storm Lie graveless till the flies and gnats of Nile Have buried them for prey I am satisfied Caesar sits down in Alexandria where I will oppose his fate Our force by land Hath nobly held our sever'd navy to Have knit again and fleet threat'ning most sea like Where hast thou been my heart Dost thou hear lady If from the field I shall return once more To kiss these lips I will appear in blood I and my sword will earn our chronicle There 's hope in't yet That 's my brave lord I will be treble sinew'd hearted breath'd And fight maliciously For when mine hours Were nice and lucky men did ransom lives Of me for jests but now I 'll set my teeth And send to darkness all that stop me Come Let 's have one other gaudy night Call to me All my sad captains fill our bowls once more Let 's mock the midnight bell It is my birthday I had thought t'have held it poor but since my lord Is Antony again I will be Cleopatra We will yet do well Call all his noble captains to my lord Do so we 'll speak to them and to night I 'll force The wine peep through their scars Come on my queen There 's sap in't yet The next time I do fight I 'll make death love me for I will contend Even with his pestilent scythe Exeunt all but ENOBARBUS Now he 'll outstare the lightning To be furious Is to be frighted out of fear and in that mood The dove will peck the estridge and I see still A diminution in our captain 's brain Restores his heart When valour preys on reason It eats the sword it fights with I will seek Some way to leave him Exit He calls me boy and chides as he had power To beat me out of Egypt My messenger He hath whipt with rods dares me to personal combat Caesar to Antony Let the old ruffian know I have many other ways to die meantime Laugh at his challenge Caesar must think When one so great begins to rage he 's hunted Even to falling Give him no breath but now Make boot of his distraction Never anger Made good guard for itself Let our best heads Know that to morrow the last of many battles We mean to fight Within our files there are Of those that serv'd Mark Antony but late Enough to fetch him in See it done And feast the army we have store to do't And they have earn'd the waste Poor Antony Exeunt He will not fight with me Domitius No Why should he not He thinks being twenty times of better fortune He is twenty men to one To morrow soldier By sea and land I 'll fight Or I will live Or bathe my dying honour in the blood Shall make it live again Woo't thou fight well I 'll strike and cry '

your monument His guard have brought him thither O sun Burn the great sphere thou mov'st in Darkling stand The varying shore o ' th ' world O Antony Antony Antony Help Charmian help Iras help Help friends below Let 's draw him hither Peace Not Caesar 's valour hath o'erthrown Antony But Antony 's hath triumph'd on itself So it should be that none but Antony Should conquer Antony but woe ' tis so I am dying Egypt dying only I here importune death awhile until Of many thousand kisses the poor last I lay upon thy lips I dare not dear Dear my lord pardon I dare not Lest I be taken Not th ' imperious show Of the full fortun'd Caesar ever shall Be brooch'd with me If knife drugs serpents have Edge sting or operation I am safe Your wife Octavia with her modest eyes And still conclusion shall acquire no honour Demuring upon me But come come Antony- Help me my women- we must draw thee up Assist good friends O quick or I am gone Here 's sport indeed How heavy weighs my lord Our strength is all gone into heaviness That makes the weight Had I great Juno 's power The strong wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up And set thee by Jove 's side Yet come a little Wishers were ever fools O come come A heavy sight I am dying Egypt dying Give me some wine and let me speak a little No let me speak and let me rail so high That the false huswife Fortune break her wheel Provok'd by my offence One word sweet queen Of Caesar seek your honour with your safety O They do not go together Gentle hear me None about Caesar trust but Proculeius My resolution and my hands I 'll trust None about Caesar The miserable change now at my end Lament nor sorrow at but please your thoughts In feeding them with those my former fortunes Wherein I liv'd the greatest prince o ' th ' world The noblest and do now not basely die Not cowardly put off my helmet to My countryman- a Roman by a Roman Valiantly vanquish'd Now my spirit is going I can no more Noblest of men woo't die Hast thou no care of me Shall I abide In this dull world which in thy absence is No better than a sty O see my women Antony dies The crown o ' th ' earth doth melt My lord O wither'd is the garland of the war The soldier 's pole is fall'n Young boys and girls Are level now with men The odds is gone And there is nothing left remarkable Beneath the visiting moon Swoons O quietness lady She 's dead too our sovereign Lady Madam O madam madam madam Royal Egypt Empress Peace peace Iras No more but e'en a woman and commanded By such poor passion as the maid that milks And does the meanest chares It were for me To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods To tell them that this world did equal theirs Till they had stol'n our jewel All 's but nought Patience is sottish and impatience does Become a dog that 's mad Then is it sin To rush into the secret house of death Ere death dare come to us How do you women What what good cheer Why how now Charmian My noble girls Ah women women look Our lamp is spent it 's out Good sirs take heart We 'll bury him and then what 's brave what 's noble Let 's do it after the high Roman fashion And make death proud to take us Come away This case of that huge spirit now is cold Ah women women Come we have no friend But resolution and the briefest end Go to him Dolabella bid him yield Being so frustrate tell him he mocks The pauses that he makes Caesar I shall Exit Wherefore is that And what art thou that dar'st Appear thus to us I am call'd Dercetas Mark Antony I serv'd who best was worthy Best to be serv'd Whilst he stood up and spoke He was my master and I wore my life To spend upon his haters If thou please To take me to thee as I was to him I 'll be to Caesar if thou pleasest not I yield thee up my life What is't thou say'st I say O Caesar Antony is dead The breaking of so great a thing should make A greater crack The round world Should have shook lions into civil streets And citizens to their dens The death of Antony Is not a single doom in the name lay A moiety of the world He is dead Caesar Not by a public minister of justice Nor by a hired knife but that self hand Which writ his honour in the acts it did Hath with the courage which the heart did lend it Splitted the heart This is his sword I robb'd his wound of it behold it stain'd With his most noble blood Look you sad friends The gods rebuke me but it is tidings To wash the eyes of kings And strange it is That nature must compel us to lament Our most persisted deeds His taints and honours Wag'd equal with him A rarer spirit never Did steer humanity But you gods will give us Some faults to make us men Caesar is touch'd When such a spacious mirror 's set before him He needs must see himself O Antony I have follow'd thee to this But we do lance Diseases in our bodies I must perforce Have shown to thee such a declining day Or look on thine we could not stall together In the whole world But yet let me lament With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts That thou my brother my competitor In top of all design my mate in empire Friend and companion in the front of war The arm of mine own body and the heart Where mine his thoughts did kindle- that our stars Unreconciliable should divide Our equalness to this Hear me good friends- A poor Egyptian yet the Queen my mistress Confin'd in all she has her monument Of thy intents desires instruction That she preparedly may frame herself To th ' way she 's forc'd to Bid her have good heart She soon shall know of us by some of ours How honourable and how kindly we Determine for her for Caesar can not learn To be ungentle So the gods preserve thee Exit Come hither Proculeius Go and say We purpose her no shame Give her what comforts The quality of her passion shall require Lest in her greatness by some mortal stroke She do defeat us for her life in Rome Would be eternal in our triumph Go And with your speediest bring us what she says And how you find her Caesar I shall Exit Gallus go you along Exit GALLUS Where 's Dolabella to second Proculeius Dolabella Let him alone for I remember now How he 's employ'd he shall in time be ready Go with me to my tent where you shall see How hardly I was drawn into this war How calm and gentle I proceeded still In all my writings Go with me and see What I can show in this Exeunt My desolation does begin to make A better life ' Tis paltry to be Caesar Not being Fortune he 's but Fortune 's knave A minister of her will and it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds Which shackles accidents and bolts up change Which sleeps and never palates more the dug The beggar 's nurse and Caesar 's Caesar sends greetings to the Queen of Egypt And bids thee study on what fair demands Thou mean'st to have him grant thee What 's thy name My name is Proculeius Antony Did tell me of you bade me trust you but I do not greatly care to be deceiv'd That have no use for trusting If your master Would have a queen his beggar you must tell him That majesty to keep decorum must No less beg than a kingdom If he please To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks Be of good cheer Y'are fall'n into a princely hand fear nothing Make your full reference freely to my lord Who is so full of grace that it flows over On all that need Let me report to him Your sweet dependency and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneel'd to Pray you tell him I am his fortune 's vassal and I send him The greatness he has got I hourly learn A doctrine of obedience and would gladly Look him i ' th ' face This I 'll report dear lady Have comfort for I know your plight is pitied Of him that caus'd it You see how easily she may be surpris'd Royal Queen O Cleopatra thou art taken Queen Quick quick good hands Drawing a dagger Hold worthy lady hold Disarms her Do not yourself such wrong who are in this Reliev'd but not betray'd What of death too That rids our dogs of languish Cleopatra Do not abuse my master 's bounty by Th ' undoing of yourself Let the world see His nobleness well acted which your death Will never let come forth Where art thou death Come hither come Come come and take a queen Worth many babes and beggars O temperance lady Sir I will eat no meat I 'll not drink sir If idle talk will once be necessary I 'll not sleep neither This mortal house I 'll ruin Do Caesar what he can Know sir that I Will not wait pinion'd at your master 's court Nor once be chastis'd with the sober eye Of dull Octavia Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me Rather on Nilus ' mud Lay me stark nak'd and let the water flies Blow me into abhorring Rather make My country 's high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains You do extend These thoughts of horror further than you shall Find cause in Caesar Proculeius What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows And he hath sent for thee For the Queen I 'll take her to my guard So Dolabella It shall content me best Be gentle to her To CLEOPATRA To Caesar I will speak what you shall please If you 'll employ me to him Say I would die Most noble Empress you have heard of me I can not tell Assuredly you know me No matter sir what I have heard or known You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams Is't not your trick I understand not madam I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony- O such another sleep that I might see But such another man If it might please ye- His face was as the heav'ns and therein stuck A sun and moon which kept their course and lighted The little O the earth Most sovereign creature- His legs bestrid the ocean his rear'd arm Crested the world His voice was propertied As all the tuned spheres and that to friends But when he meant to quail and shake the orb He was as rattling thunder For his bounty There was no winter in't an autumn ' twas That grew the more by reaping His delights Were dolphin like they show'd his back above The element they liv'd in In his livery Walk'd crowns and crownets realms and islands were As plates dropp'd from his pocket Cleopatra- Think you there was or might be such a man As this I dreamt of Gentle madam no You lie up to the hearing of the gods But if there be nor ever were one such It 's past the size of drearning Nature wants stuff To vie strange forms with fancy yet t ' imagine An Antony were nature 's piece ' gainst fancy Condemning shadows quite Hear me good madam Your loss is as yourself great and you bear it As answering to the weight Would I might never O'ertake pursu'd success but I do feel By the rebound of yours a grief that smites My very heart at root I thank you sir Know you what Caesar means to do with me I am loath to tell you what I would you knew Nay pray you sir Though he be honourable- He 'll lead me then in triumph Madam he will I know't Flourish Which is the Queen of Egypt It is the Emperor madam CLEOPATPA kneels Arise you shall not kneel I pray you rise rise Egypt Sir the gods Will have it thus my master and my lord I must obey Take to you no hard thoughts The record of what injuries you did us Though written in our flesh we shall remember As things but done by chance Sole sir o ' th ' world I can not project mine own cause so well To make it clear but do confess I have Been laden with like frailties which before Have often sham'd our sex Cleopatra know We will extenuate rather than enforce If you apply yourself to our intents- Which towards you are most gentle- you shall find A benefit in this change but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony 's course you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes and put your children To that destruction which I 'll guard them from If thereon you rely I 'll take my leave And may through all the world ' Tis yours and we Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest shall Hang in what place you please Here my good

treasurer let him speak my lord Upon his peril that I have reserv'd To myself nothing Speak the truth Seleucus Madam I had rather seal my lips than to my peril Speak that which is not What have I kept back Enough to purchase what you have made known Nay blush not Cleopatra I approve Your wisdom in the deed See Caesar O behold How pomp is followed Mine will now be yours And should we shift estates yours would be mine The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild O slave of no more trust Than love that 's hir'd What goest thou back Thou shalt Go back I warrant thee but I 'll catch thine eyes Though they had wings Slave soulless villain dog O rarely base Good Queen let us entreat you O Caesar what a wounding shame is this That thou vouchsafing here to visit me Doing the honour of thy lordliness To one so meek that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy Say good Caesar That I some lady trifles have reserv'd Immoment toys things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal and say Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia to induce Their mediation- must I be unfolded With one that I have bred The gods It smites me Beneath the fall I have To SELEUCUS Prithee go hence Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits Through th ' ashes of my chance Wert thou a man Thou wouldst have mercy on me Forbear Seleucus Exit SELEUCUS Be it known that we the greatest are misthought For things that others do and when we fall We answer others ' merits in our name Are therefore to be pitied Cleopatra Not what you have reserv'd nor what acknowledg'd Put we i ' th ' roll of conquest Still be't yours Bestow it at your pleasure and believe Caesar 's no merchant to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold Therefore be cheer'd Make not your thoughts your prisons No dear Queen For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel Feed and sleep Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend and so adieu My master and my lord Not so Adieu He words me girls he words me that I should not Be noble to myself But hark thee Charmian Finish good lady the bright day is done And we are for the dark Hie thee again I have spoke already and it is provided Go put it to the haste Madam I will Where 's the Queen Behold sir Exit Dolabella Madam as thereto sworn by your command Which my love makes religion to obey I tell you this Caesar through Syria Intends his journey and within three days You with your children will he send before Make your best use of this I have perform'd Your pleasure and my promise Dolabella I shall remain your debtor I your servant Adieu good Queen I must attend on Caesar Farewell and thanks Exit DOLABELLA Now Iras what think'st thou Thou an Egyptian puppet shall be shown In Rome as well as I. Mechanic slaves With greasy aprons rules and hammers shall Uplift us to the view in their thick breaths Rank of gross diet shall we be enclouded And forc'd to drink their vapour The gods forbid Nay ' tis most certain Iras Saucy lictors Will catch at us like strumpets and scald rhymers Ballad us out o ' tune the quick comedians Extemporally will stage us and present Our Alexandrian revels Antony Shall be brought drunken forth and I shall see Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness I ' th ' posture of a whore O the good gods Nay that 's certain I 'll never see't for I am sure mine nails Are stronger than mine eyes Why that 's the way To fool their preparation and to conquer Their most absurd intents Here is a rural fellow That will not be denied your Highness ' presence He brings you figs Let him come in Exit GUARDSMAN What poor an instrument May do a noble deed He brings me liberty My resolution 's plac'd and I have nothing Of woman in me Now from head to foot I am marble constant now the fleeting moon No planet is of mine This is the man Avoid and leave him Exit GUARDSMAN Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there That kills and pains not Truly I have him But I would not be the party that should desire you to touch him for his biting is immortal those that do die of it do seldom or never recover Remember'st thou any that have died on't Very many men and women too I heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman but something given to lie as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it what pain she felt- truly she makes a very good report o ' th ' worm But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do But this is most falliable the worm 's an odd worm Get thee hence farewell I wish you all joy of the worm Farewell You must think this look you that the worm will do his kind Ay ay farewell Look you the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people for indeed there is no goodness in the worm Take thou no care it shall be heeded Very good Give it nothing I pray you for it is not worth the feeding Will it eat me You must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman I know that a woman is a dish for the gods if the devil dress her not But truly these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women for in every ten that they make the devils mar five Well get thee gone farewell Yes forsooth I wish you joy o ' th ' worm Exit Give me my robe put on my crown I have Immortal longings in me Now no more The juice of Egypt 's grape shall moist this lip Yare yare good Iras quick Methinks I hear Antony call I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act I hear him mock The luck of Caesar which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath Husband I come Now to that name my courage prove my title I am fire and air my other elements I give to baser life So have you done Come then and take the last warmth of my lips Farewell kind Charmian Iras long farewell Dissolve thick cloud and rain that I may say The gods themselves do weep This proves me base If she first meet the curled Antony He 'll make demand of her and spend that kiss Which is my heaven to have Come thou mortal wretch O Eastern star Peace peace Dost thou not see my baby at my breast That sucks the nurse asleep O break O break As sweet as balm as soft as air as gentle- O Antony Nay I will take thee too In this vile world So fare thee well Now boast thee death in thy possession lies A lass unparallel'd Downy windows close And golden Phoebus never be beheld Of eyes again so royal Your crown 's awry I 'll mend it and then play- Where 's the Queen Speak softly wake her not Caesar hath sent- Too slow a messenger Applies an asp O come apace dispatch I partly feel thee Approach ho All 's not well Caesar 's beguil'd There 's Dolabella sent from Caesar call him What work is here Charmian is this well done It is well done and fitting for a princes Descended of so many royal kings Ah soldier CHARMIAN dies How goes it here All dead Caesar thy thoughts Touch their effects in this Thyself art coming To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou So sought'st to hinder O sir you are too sure an augurer That you did fear is done Bravest at the last She levell'd at our purposes and being royal Took her own way The manner of their deaths I do not see them bleed Who was last with them A simple countryman that brought her figs This was his basket Poison'd then O Caesar This Charmian liv'd but now she stood and spake I found her trimming up the diadem On her dead mistress Tremblingly she stood And on the sudden dropp'd O noble weakness If they had swallow'd poison ' twould appear By external swelling but she looks like sleep As she would catch another Antony In her strong toil of grace Here on her breast There is a vent of blood and something blown The like is on her arm This is an aspic 's trail and these fig leaves Have slime upon them such as th ' aspic leaves Upon the caves of Nile Most probable That so she died for her physician tells me She hath pursu'd conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument She shall be buried by her Antony No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous High events as these Strike those that make them and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral And then to Rome Come Dolabella see High order in this great solemnity Exeunt As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns and as thou say'st charged my brother on his blessing to breed me well and there begins my sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and report speaks goldenly of his profit For my part he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more properly stays me here at home unkept for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox His horses are bred better for besides that they are fair with their feeding they are taught their manage and to that end riders dearly hir'd but I his brother gain nothing under him but growth for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me He lets me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a brother and as much as in him lies mines my gentility with my education This is it Adam that grieves me and the spirit of my father which I think is within me begins to mutiny against this servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I know no wise remedy how to avoid it Yonder comes my master your brother Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up ADAM retires Now sir what make you here Nothing I am not taught to make any thing What mar you then sir Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness Marry sir be better employed and be nought awhile Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them What prodigal portion have I spent that I should come to such penury Know you where you are sir O sir very well here in your orchard Know you before whom sir Ay better than him I am before knows me I know you are my eldest brother and in the gentle condition of blood you should so know me The courtesy of nations allows you my better in that you are the first born but the same tradition takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as you albeit I confess your coming before me is nearer to his reverence What boy Strikes him Come come elder brother you are too young in this Wilt thou lay hands on me villain I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys He was my father and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy tongue for saying so Thou has rail'd on thyself Coming forward Sweet masters be patient for your father 's remembrance be at accord Let me go I say I will not till I please you shall hear me My father charg'd you in his will to give me good education you have train'd me like a peasant obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman like qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament with that I will go buy my fortunes And what wilt thou do Beg when that is spent Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled with you you shall have some part of your will I pray you leave me I no further offend you than becomes me for my good Get you with him you old dog Is ' old dog ' my reward Most true I have lost my teeth in your service God be with my old master He would not have spoke such a word Is it even so Begin you to grow upon me I will physic your rankness and yet give no thousand crowns neither Holla Dennis Calls your worship not Charles the Duke 's wrestler here to speak with me So please you he is here at the door and importunes access to you Call him in Exit DENNIS ' Twill be a good way and to morrow the wrestling is Good morrow to your worship Good Monsieur Charles What 's the new news at the new court There 's no news at the court sir but the old news that is the old Duke is banished by his younger brother the new Duke and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him whose lands and revenues enrich the new Duke therefore he gives them good leave to wander Can you tell if Rosalind the Duke 's daughter be banished with her father O no for the Duke 's daughter her cousin so loves her being ever from their cradles bred together that she would have followed her exile or have died to stay behind her She is at the court and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and never two ladies loved as they do Where will the old Duke live They say he is already in the Forest of Arden and a many merry men with him and there they live like the old Robin Hood of England They say many young gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time carelessly as they did in the golden world What you wrestle to morrow before the new Duke Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a matter I am given sir secretly to understand that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against me to try a fall To morrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well Your brother is but young and tender and for your love I would be loath to foil him as I must for my own honour if he come in therefore out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you withal that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into in that it is thing of his own search and altogether against my will Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had myself notice of my brother 's purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it but he is resolute I 'll tell thee Charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full of ambition an envious emulator of every man 's good parts a secret and villainous contriver against me his natural brother Therefore use thy discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger And thou wert best look to't for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee he will practise against thee by poison entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak it there is not one so young and so villainous this day living I speak but brotherly of him but should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come to morrow I 'll give him his payment If ever he go alone again I 'll never wrestle for prize more And so God keep your worship Farewell good Charles Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see an end of him for my soul yet I know not why hates nothing more than he Yet he 's gentle never school'd and yet learned full of noble device of all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much in the heart of the world and especially of my own people who best know him that I am altogether misprised But it shall not be so long this wrestler shall clear all Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy thither which now I 'll go about Exit I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of and would you yet I were merrier Unless you could teach me to forget a banished father you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure Herein I see thou lov'st me not with the full weight that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father had banished thy uncle the Duke my father so thou hadst been still with me I could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously temper'd as mine is to thee Well I will forget the condition of my estate to rejoice in yours You know my father hath no child but I nor none is like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce I will render thee again in affection By mine honour I will and when I break that oath let me turn monster therefore my sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let me see what think you of falling in love Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again What shall be our sport then Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally I would we could do so for her benefits are mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women ' Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest and those that she makes honest she makes very ill favouredly Nay now thou goest from Fortune 's office to Nature 's Fortune reigns in gifts of the world not in the lineaments of Nature No when Nature hath made a fair creature may she not by Fortune fall into the fire Though Nature hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when Fortune makes Nature 's natural the cutter off of Nature 's wit Peradventure this is not Fortune 's work neither but Nature 's who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone for always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now wit Whither wander you Mistress you must come away to your father Were you made the messenger No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you Where learned you that oath fool Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught Now I 'll stand to it the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and yet was not the knight forsworn How prove you that in the great heap of your knowledge Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave By our beards if we had them thou art By my knavery if I had it then I were But if you swear by that that not you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour for he never had any or if he had he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or that mustard Prithee who is't that thou mean'st One that old Frederick your father loves My father 's love is enough to honour him Enough speak no more of him you 'll be whipt for taxation one of these days The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly By my troth thou sayest true for since the little wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show Here comes Monsieur Le Beau With his mouth full of news Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young Then shall we be news cramm'd All the better we shall be the more marketable Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau What 's the news Fair Princess you have lost much good sport Sport of what colour What colour madam How shall I answer you As wit and fortune will Or as the Destinies decrees Well said that was laid on with a trowel Nay if I keep not my rank- Thou losest thy old smell You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good wrestling which you have lost the sight of Yet tell us the manner of the wrestling I will tell you the beginning and if it please your ladyships you may see the end for the best is yet to do and here where you are they are coming to perform it Well the beginning that is dead and buried There comes an old man and his three sons- I could match this beginning with an old tale Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence With bills on their necks ' Be it known unto all men by these presents'- The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the Duke 's wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs that there is little hope of life in him So he serv'd the second and so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man their father making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping Alas But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies have lost Why this that I speak of Thus men may grow wiser every day It is the first time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies Or I I promise thee But is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides Is there yet another dotes upon rib breaking Shall we see this wrestling cousin You must if you stay here for here is the place appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to perform it Yonder sure they are coming Let us now stay and see it Come on since the youth will not be entreated his own peril on his forwardness Is yonder the man Even he madam Alas he is too young yet he looks successfully How now daughter and cousin Are you crept hither to see the wrestling Ay my liege so please you give us leave You will take little delight in it I can tell you there is such odds in the man In pity of the challenger 's youth I would fain dissuade him but he will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if you can move him Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau Do so I 'll not be by Monsieur the Challenger the Princess calls for you I attend them with all respect and duty Young man have you challeng'd Charles the wrestler No fair Princess he is the general challenger I come but in as others do to try with him the strength of my youth Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your years You have seen cruel proof of this man 's strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise We pray you for your own sake to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt Do young sir your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the Duke that the wrestling might not go forward I beseech you punish me not with your hard thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing But let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if I be foil'd there is but one sham'd that was never gracious if kill'd but one dead that is willing to be so I shall do my friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the world no injury for in it I have nothing only in the world I fill up a place which may be better supplied when I have made it empty The little strength that I have I would it were with you And mine to eke out hers Fare you well Pray heaven I be deceiv'd in you Your heart 's desires be with you Come where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working You shall try but one fall No I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second that have so mightily persuaded him from a first You mean to mock me after you should not have mock'd me before but come your ways Now Hercules be thy speed young man I would I were invisible to catch the strong fellow by the leg They wrestle O excellent young man If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who should down No more no more Yes I beseech your Grace I am not yet well breath'd How dost thou Charles He can not speak my lord Bear him away What is thy name young man Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys I would thou hadst been son to some man else The world esteem'd thy father honourable But I did find him still mine enemy Thou shouldst have better pleas'd me with this deed Hadst thou descended from another house But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth I would thou hadst told me of another father Were I my father coz would I do this I am more proud to be Sir Rowland 's son His youngest son- and would not change that calling To be adopted heir to Frederick My father lov'd Sir Rowland as his soul And all the world was of my father 's mind Had I before known this young man his son I should have given him tears unto entreaties Ere he should thus have ventur'd Gentle cousin Let us go thank him and encourage him My father 's rough and envious disposition Sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserv'd If you do keep your promises in love But justly as you have exceeded all promise Your mistress shall be happy Gentleman Giving him a chain from her neck Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune That could give more but that her hand lacks means Shall we go coz Ay Fare you well fair gentleman Can I not say ' I thank you ' My better parts Are all thrown down and that which here stands up Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block He calls us back My pride fell with my fortunes I 'll ask him what he would Did you call sir Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown More than your enemies Will you go coz Have with you Fare you well What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue I can not speak to her yet she urg'd conference O poor Orlando thou art overthrown Or Charles or something weaker masters thee Good sir I do in friendship counsel you To leave this place Albeit you have deserv'd High commendation true applause and love Yet such is now the Duke 's condition That he misconstrues all that you have done The Duke is humorous what he is indeed More suits you to conceive than I to speak of I thank you sir and pray you tell me this Which of the two was daughter of the Duke That here was at the wrestling Neither his daughter if we judge by manners But yet indeed the smaller is his daughter The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke And here detain'd by her usurping uncle To keep his daughter company whose loves Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters But I can tell you that of late this Duke Hath ta'en displeasure ' gainst his gentle niece Grounded upon no other argument But that the people praise her for her virtues And pity her for her good father 's sake And on my life his malice ' gainst the lady Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well Hereafter in a better world than this I shall desire more love and knowledge of you I rest much bounden to you fare you well Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy Not a word Not one to throw at a dog No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons Then there were two cousins laid up when the one should be lam'd with reasons and the other mad without any But is all this for your father No some of it is for my child 's father O how full of briers is this working day world They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart Hem them away I would try if I could cry ' hem ' and have him Come come wrestle with thy affections O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself O a good wish upon you You will try in time in despite of a fall But turning these jests out of service let us talk in good earnest Is it possible on such a sudden you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Rowland 's youngest son The Duke my father lov'd his father dearly Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly By this kind of chase I should hate him for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate not Orlando No faith hate him not for my sake Why should I not Doth he not deserve well Let me love him for that and do you love him because I do Look here comes the Duke With his eyes full of anger Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste And get you from our court Me uncle You cousin Within these ten days if that thou beest found So near our public court as twenty miles Thou diest for it I do beseech your Grace Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me If with myself I hold intelligence Or have acquaintance with mine own desires If that I do not dream or be not frantic- As I do trust I am not- then dear uncle Never so much as in a thought unborn Did I offend your Highness Thus do all traitors If their purgation did consist in words They are as innocent as grace itself Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not Yet your mistrust can not make me a traitor Tell me whereon the likelihood depends Thou art thy father 's daughter there 's enough SO was I when your Highness took his dukedom So was I when your Highness banish'd him Treason is not inherited my lord Or if we did derive it from our friends What 's that to me My father was no traitor Then good my liege mistake me not so much To think my poverty is treacherous Dear sovereign hear me speak Ay Celia we stay'd her for your sake Else had she with her father rang'd along I did not then entreat to have her stay It was your pleasure and your own remorse I was too young that time to value her But now I know her If she be a traitor Why so am I we still have slept together Rose at an instant learn'd play'd eat together And wheresoe'er we went like Juno 's swans Still we went coupled and inseparable She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness Her very silence and her patience Speak to the people and they pity her Thou art a fool She robs thee of thy name And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous When she is gone Then open not thy lips Firm and irrevocable is my doom Which I have pass'd upon her she is banish'd Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege I can not live out of her company You are a fool You niece provide yourself If you outstay the time upon mine honour And in the greatness of my word you die O my poor Rosalind Whither wilt thou go Wilt thou change fathers I will give thee mine I charge thee be not thou more griev'd than I am I have more cause Thou hast not cousin Prithee be cheerful Know'st thou not the Duke Hath banish'd me his daughter That he hath not No hath not Rosalind lacks then the love Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one Shall we be sund'red Shall we part sweet girl No let my father seek another heir Therefore devise with me how we may fly Whither to go and what to bear with us And do not seek to take your charge upon you To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale Say what thou canst I 'll go along with thee Why whither shall we go To seek my uncle in the Forest of Arden Alas what danger will it be to us Maids as we are to travel forth so far Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold I 'll put myself in poor and mean attire And with a kind of umber smirch my face The like do you so shall we pass along And never stir assailants Were it not better Because that I am more than common tall That I did suit me all points like a man A gallant curtle axe upon my thigh A boar spear in my hand and- in my heart Lie there what hidden woman 's fear there will- We 'll have a swashing and a martial outside As many other mannish cowards have That do outface it with their semblances What shall I call thee when thou art a man I 'll have no worse a name than Jove 's own page And therefore look you call me Ganymede But what will you be call'd Something that hath a reference to my state No longer Celia but Aliena But cousin what if we assay'd to steal The clownish fool out of your father 's court Would he not be a comfort to our travel He 'll go along o'er the wide world with me Leave me alone to woo him Let 's away And get our jewels and our wealth together Devise the fittest time and safest way To hide us from pursuit that will be made After my flight Now go we in content To liberty and not to banishment Exeunt Now my co mates and brothers in exile Hath not old custom made this life more sweet Than that of painted pomp Are not these woods More free from peril than the envious court Here feel we not the penalty of Adam The seasons ' difference as the icy fang And churlish chiding of the winter 's wind Which when it bites and blows upon my body Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say ' This is no flattery these are counsellors That feelingly persuade me what I am ' Sweet are the uses of adversity Which like the toad ugly and venomous Wears yet a precious jewel in his head And this our life exempt from public haunt Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks Sermons in stones and good in everything I would not change it Happy is your Grace That can translate the stubbornness of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a style Come shall we go and kill us venison And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools Being native burghers of this desert city Should in their own confines with forked heads Have their round haunches gor'd Indeed my lord The melancholy Jaques grieves at that And in that kind swears you do more usurp Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you To day my Lord of Amiens and myself Did steal behind him as he lay along Under an oak whose antique root peeps out Upon the brook that brawls along this wood To the which place a poor sequest'red stag That from the hunter 's aim had ta'en a hurt Did come to languish and indeed my lord The wretched animal heav'd forth such groans That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat Almost to bursting and the big round tears Cours'd one another down his innocent nose In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool Much marked of the melancholy Jaques Stood on th ' extremest verge of the swift brook Augmenting it with tears But what said Jaques Did he not moralize this spectacle O yes into a thousand similes First for his weeping into the needless stream ' Poor deer ' quoth he ' thou mak'st a testament As worldlings do giving thy sum of more To that which had too much ' Then being there alone Left and abandoned of his velvet friends '' Tis right ' quoth he ' thus misery doth part The flux of company ' Anon a careless herd Full of the pasture jumps along by him And never stays to greet him ' Ay ' quoth Jaques ' Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens ' Tis just the fashion Wherefore do you look Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there ' Thus most invectively he pierceth through The body of the country city court Yea and of this our life swearing that we Are mere usurpers tyrants and what 's worse To fright the animals and to kill them up In their assign'd and native dwelling place And did you leave him in this contemplation We did my lord weeping and commenting Upon the sobbing deer Show me the place I love to cope him in these sullen fits For then he 's full of matter I 'll bring you to him straight Exeunt Can it be possible that no man saw them It can not be some villains of my court Are of consent and sufferance in this I can not hear of any that did see her The ladies her attendants of her chamber Saw her abed and in the morning early They found the bed untreasur'd of their mistress My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft Your Grace was wo nt to laugh is also missing Hisperia the Princess ' gentlewoman Confesses that she secretly o'erheard Your daughter and her cousin much commend The parts and graces of the wrestler That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles And she believes wherever they are gone That youth is surely in their company Send to his brother fetch that gallant hither If he be absent bring his brother to me I 'll make him find him Do this suddenly And let not search and inquisition quail To bring again these foolish runaways Exeunt Who 's there What my young master O my gentle master O my sweet master O you memory Of old Sir Rowland Why what make you here Why are you virtuous Why do people love you And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant Why would you be so fond to overcome The bonny prizer of the humorous Duke Your praise is come too swiftly home before you Know you not master to some kind of men Their graces serve them but as enemies No more do yours Your virtues gentle master Are sanctified and holy traitors to you O what a world is this when what is comely Envenoms him that bears it Why what 's the matter O unhappy youth Come not within these doors within this roof The enemy of all your graces lives Your brother- no no brother yet the son- Yet not the son I will not call him son Of him I was about to call his father- Hath heard your praises and this night he means To burn the lodging where you use to lie And you within it If he fail of that He will have other means to cut you off I overheard him and his practices This is no place this house is but a butchery Abhor it fear it do not enter it Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go No matter whither so you come not here What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food Or with a base and boist'rous sword enforce A thievish living on the common road This I must do or know not what to do Yet this I will not do do how I can I rather will subject me to the malice Of a diverted blood and bloody brother But do not so I have five hundred crowns The thrifty hire I sav'd under your father Which I did store to be my foster nurse When service should in my old limbs lie lame And unregarded age in corners thrown Take that and He that doth the ravens feed Yea providently caters for the sparrow Be comfort to my age Here is the gold All this I give you Let me be your servant Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty For in my youth I never did apply Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo The means of weakness and debility Therefore my age is as a lusty winter Frosty but kindly Let me go with you I 'll do the service of a younger man In all your business and necessities O good old man how well in thee appears The constant service of the antique world When service sweat for duty not for meed Thou art not for the fashion of these times Where none will sweat but for promotion And having that do choke their service up Even with the having it is not so with thee But poor old man thou prun'st a rotten tree That can not so much as a blossom yield In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry But come thy ways we 'll go along together And ere we have thy youthful wages spent We 'll light upon some settled low content Master go on and I will follow the To the last gasp with truth and loyalty From seventeen years till now almost four score Here lived I but now live here no more At seventeen years many their fortunes seek But at fourscore it is too late a week Yet fortune can not recompense me better Than to die well and not my master 's debtor Exeunt O Jupiter how weary are my spirits I Care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary I could find in my heart to disgrace my man 's apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage good Aliena I pray you bear with me I can not go no further For my part I had rather bear with you than bear you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you for I think you have no money in your purse Well this is the Forest of Arden Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was at home I was in a better place but travellers must be content Ay be so good Touchstone Look you who comes here a young man and an old in solemn talk That is the way to make her scorn you still O Corin that thou knew'st how I do love her I partly guess for I have lov'd ere now No Corin being old thou canst not guess Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow But if thy love were ever like to mine As sure I think did never man love so How many actions most ridiculous Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy Into a thousand that I have forgotten O thou didst then never love so heartily If thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly That ever love did make thee run into Thou hast not lov'd Or if thou hast not sat as I do now Wearing thy hearer in thy mistress ' praise Thou hast not lov'd Or if thou hast not broke from company Abruptly as my passion now makes me Thou hast not lov'd O Phebe Phebe Phebe Exit Silvius Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound I have by hard adventure found mine own And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming a night to Jane Smile and I remember the kissing of her batler and the cow 's dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milk'd and I remember the wooing of peascod instead of her from whom I took two cods and giving her them again said with weeping tears ' Wear these for my sake ' We that are true lovers run into strange capers but as all is mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly Thou speak'st wiser than thou art ware of Nay I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I break my shins against it Jove Jove this shepherd 's passion Is much upon my fashion And mine but it grows something stale with me I pray you one of you question yond man If he for gold will give us any food I faint almost to death Holla you clown Peace fool he 's not thy Ensman Who calls Your betters sir Else are they very wretched Peace I say Good even to you friend And to you gentle sir and to you all I prithee shepherd if that love or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed Here 's a young maid with travel much oppress'd And faints for succour Fair sir I pity her And wish for her sake more than for mine own My fortunes were more able to relieve her But I am shepherd to another man And do not shear the fleeces that I graze My master is of churlish disposition And little recks to find the way to heaven By doing deeds of hospitality Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now By reason of his absence there is nothing That you will feed on but what is come see And in my voice most welcome shall you be What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture That young swain that you saw here but erewhile That little cares for buying any thing I pray thee if it stand with honesty Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock And thou shalt have to pay for it of us And we will mend thy wages I like this place And willingly could waste my time in it Assuredly the thing is to be sold Go with me if you like upon report The soil the profit and this kind of life I will your very faithful feeder be And buy it with your gold right suddenly Exeunt Under the greenwood tree More more I prithee more It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques I thank it More I prithee more I can suck melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs More I prithee more My voice is ragged I know I can not please you I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to sing Come more another stanzo Call you 'em stanzos What you will Monsieur Jaques Nay I care not for their names they owe me nothing Will you sing More at your request than to please myself Well then if ever I thank any man I 'll thank you but that they call compliment is like th ' encounter of two dog apes and when a man thanks me heartily methinks have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will not hold your tongues Well I 'll end the song Sirs cover the while the Duke will drink under this tree He hath been all this day to look you And I have been all this day to avoid him He is to disputable for my company I think of as many matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no boast of them Come warble come I 'll give you a verse to this note that I made yesterday in despite of my invention And I 'll sing it Thus it goes What 's that ' ducdame ' ' Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a circle I 'll go sleep if I can if I can not I 'll rail against all the first born of Egypt And I 'll go seek the Duke his banquet is prepar'd Dear master I can go no further O I die for food Here lie I down and measure out my grave Farewell kind master Why how now Adam No greater heart in thee Live a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little If this uncouth forest yield anything savage I will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at the arm 's end I will here be with the presently and if I bring thee not something to eat I will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I come thou art a mocker of my labour Well said thou look'st cheerly and I 'll be with thee quickly Yet thou liest in the bleak air Come I will bear thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner if there live anything in this desert Cheerly good Adam Exeunt I think he be transform'd into a beast For I can nowhere find him like a man My lord he is but even now gone hence Here was he merry hearing of a song If he compact of jars grow musical We shall have shortly discord in the spheres Go seek him tell him I would speak with him He saves my labour by his own approach Why how now monsieur what a life is this That your poor friends must woo your company What you look merrily A fool a fool I met a fool i ' th ' forest A motley fool A miserable world As I do live by food I met a fool Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms In good set terms- and yet a motley fool ' Good morrow fool ' quoth I ' No sir ' quoth he ' Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune ' And then he drew a dial from his poke And looking on it with lack lustre eye Says very wisely ' It is ten o'clock Thus we may see ' quoth he ' how the world wags ' Tis but an hour ago since it was nine And after one hour more ' twill be eleven And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe And then from hour to hour we rot and rot And thereby hangs a tale ' When I did hear The motley fool thus moral on the time My lungs began to crow like chanticleer That fools should be so deep contemplative And I did laugh sans intermission An hour by his dial O noble fool A worthy fool Motley 's the only wear What fool is this O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier And says if ladies be but young and fair They have the gift to know it and in his brain Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit After a voyage he hath strange places cramm'd With observation the which he vents In mangled forms O that I were a fool I am ambitious for a motley coat Thou shalt have one It is my only suit Provided that you weed your better judgments Of all opinion that grows rank in them That I am wise I must have liberty Withal as large a charter as the wind To blow on whom I please for so fools have And they that are most galled with my folly They most must laugh And why sir must they so The why is plain as way to parish church He that a fool doth very wisely hit Doth very foolishly although he smart Not to seem senseless of the bob if not The wise man 's folly is anatomiz'd Even by the squand'ring glances of the fool Invest me in my motley give me leave To speak my mind and I will through and through Cleanse the foul body of th ' infected world If they will patiently receive my medicine Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do What for a counter would I do but good Most Mischievous foul sin in chiding sin For thou thyself hast been a libertine As sensual as the brutish sting itself And all th ' embossed sores and headed evils That thou with license of free foot hast caught Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world Why who cries out on pride That can therein tax any private party Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea Till that the wearer 's very means do ebb What woman in the city do I name When that I say the city woman bears The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders Who can come in and say that I mean her When such a one as she such is her neighbour Or what is he of basest function That says his bravery is not on my cost Thinking that I mean him but therein suits His folly to the mettle of my speech There then how then what then Let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him if it do him right Then he hath wrong'd himself if he be free Why then my taxing like a wild goose flies Unclaim'd of any man But who comes here Forbear and eat no more Why I have eat none yet Nor shalt not till necessity be serv'd Of what kind should this cock come of Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distress Or else a rude despiser of good manners That in civility thou seem'st so empty You touch'd my vein at first the thorny point Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show Of smooth civility yet arn I inland bred And know some nurture But forbear I say He dies that touches any of this fruit Till I and my affairs are answered An you will not be answer'd with reason I must die What would you have Your gentleness shall force More than your force move us to gentleness I almost die for food and let me have it Sit down and feed and welcome to our table Speak you so gently Pardon me I pray you I thought that all things had been savage here And therefore put I on the countenance Of stern commandment But whate'er you are That in this desert inaccessible Under the shade of melancholy boughs Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time If ever you have look'd on better days If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church If ever sat at any good man 's feast If ever from your eyelids wip'd a tear And know what ' tis to pity and be pitied Let gentleness my strong enforcement be In the which hope I blush and hide my sword True is it that we have seen better days And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church And sat at good men 's feasts and wip'd our eyes Of drops that sacred pity hath engend'red And therefore sit you down in gentleness And take upon command what help we have That to your wanting may be minist'red Then but forbear your food a little while Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn And give it food There is an old poor man Who after me hath many a weary step Limp'd in pure love till he be first suffic'd Oppress'd with two weak evils age and hunger I will not touch a bit Go find him out And we will nothing waste till you return I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy This wide and universal theatre Presents more woeful pageants than the scene Wherein we play in All the world 's a stage And all the men and women merely players They have their exits and their entrances And one man in his time plays many parts His acts being seven ages At first the infant Mewling and puking in the nurse 's arms Then the whining school boy with his satchel And shining morning face creeping like snail Unwillingly to school And then the lover Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad Made to his mistress ' eyebrow Then a soldier Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel Seeking the bubble reputation Even in the cannon 's mouth And then the justice In fair round belly with good capon lin'd With eyes severe and beard of formal cut Full of wise saws and modern instances And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon With spectacles on nose and pouch on side His youthful hose well sav'd a world too wide For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice Turning again toward childish treble pipes And whistles in his sound Last scene of all That ends this strange eventful history Is second childishness and mere oblivion Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans every thing Welcome Set down your venerable burden And let him feed I thank you most for him So had you need I scarce can speak to thank you for myself Welcome fall to I will not trouble you As yet to question you about your fortunes Give us some music and good cousin sing If that you were the good Sir Rowland 's son As you have whisper'd faithfully you were And as mine eye doth his effigies witness Most truly limn'd and living in your face Be truly welcome hither I am the Duke That lov'd your father The residue of your fortune Go to my cave and tell me Good old man Thou art right welcome as thy master is Support him by the arm Give me your hand And let me all your fortunes understand Exeunt Not see him since Sir sir that can not be But were I not the better part made mercy I should not seek an absent argument Of my revenge thou present But look to it Find out thy brother wheresoe'er he is Seek him with candle bring him dead or living Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more To seek a living in our territory Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine Worth seizure do we seize into our hands Till thou canst quit thee by thy brother 's mouth Of what we think against thee O that your Highness knew my heart in this I never lov'd my brother in my life More villain thou Well push him out of doors And let my officers of such a nature Make an extent upon his house and lands Do this expediently and turn him going Exeunt Hang there my verse in witness of my love And thou thrice crowned Queen of Night survey With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above Thy huntress ' name that my full life doth sway O Rosalind these trees shall be my books And in their barks my thoughts I 'll character That every eye which in this forest looks Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where Run run Orlando carve on every tree The fair the chaste and unexpressive she Exit And how like you this shepherd 's life Master Touchstone Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good life but in respect that it is a shepherd 's life it is nought In respect that it is solitary I like it very well but in respect that it is private it is a very vile life Now in respect it is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in respect it is not in the court it is tedious As it is a spare life look you it fits my humour well but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd No more but that I know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is and that he that wants money means and content is without three good friends that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in court shepherd No truly Then thou art damn'd Nay I hope Truly thou art damn'd like an ill roasted egg all on one side For not being at court Your reason Why if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good manners if thou never saw'st good manners then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous state shepherd Not a whit Touchstone Those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the country is most mockable at the court You told me you salute not at the court but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds Instance briefly come instance Why we are still handling our ewes and their fells you know are greasy Why do not your courtier 's hands sweat And is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man Shallow shallow A better instance I say come Besides our hands are hard Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again A more sounder instance come And they are often tarr'd over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar The courtier 's hands are perfum'd with civet Most shallow man thou worm 's meat in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd You have too courtly a wit for me I 'll rest Wilt thou rest damn'd God help thee shallow man God make incision in thee thou art raw Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get that I wear owe no man hate envy no man 's happiness glad of other men 's good content with my harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a bell wether and to betray a she lamb of a twelvemonth to crooked pated old cuckoldly ram out of all reasonable match If thou beest not damn'd for this the devil himself will have no shepherds I can not see else how thou shouldst scape Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistress 's brother ' From the east to western Inde I 'll rhyme you so eight years together dinners and suppers and sleeping hours excepted It is the right butter women 's rank to market Out fool For a taste Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree Truly the tree yields bad fruit I 'll graff it with you and then I shall graff it with a medlar Then it will be the earliest fruit i ' th ' country for you 'll be rotten ere you be half ripe and that 's the right virtue of the medlar You have said but whether wisely or no let the forest judge Peace Here comes my sister reading stand aside ' Why should this a desert be O most gentle pulpiter What tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal and never cried ' Have patience good people ' How now Back friends shepherd go off a little go with him sirrah Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage Didst thou hear these verses O yes I heard them all and more too for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear That 's no matter the feet might bear the verses Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hang'd and carved upon these trees I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came for look here what I found on a palm tree I was never so berhym'd since Pythagoras ' time that I was an Irish rat which I can hardly remember Trow you who hath done this Is it a man And a chain that you once wore about his neck Change you colour I prithee who O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to meet but mountains may be remov'd with earthquakes and so encounter Nay but who is it Is it possible Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence tell me who it is O wonderful wonderful most wonderful wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that out of all whooping Good my complexion dost thou think though I am caparison'd like a man I have a doublet and hose in my disposition One inch of delay more is a South Sea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it quickly and speak apace I would thou could'st stammer that thou mightst pour this conceal'd man out of thy mouth as wine comes out of narrow mouth'd bottle- either too much at once or none at all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that I may drink thy tidings So you may put a man in your belly Is he of God 's making What manner of man Is his head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard Nay he hath but a little beard Why God will send more if the man will be thankful Let me stay the growth of his beard if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin It is young Orlando that tripp'd up the wrestler 's heels and your heart both in an instant Nay but the devil take mocking Speak sad brow and true maid I ' faith coz ' tis he Orlando Orlando Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and hose What did he when thou saw'st him What said he How look'd he Wherein went he What makes he here Did he ask for me Where remains he How parted he with thee And when shalt thou see him again Answer me in one word You must borrow me Gargantua 's mouth first ' tis a word too great for any mouth of this age 's size To say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism But doth he know that I am in this forest and in man 's apparel Looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover but take a taste of my finding him and relish it with good observance I found him under a tree like a dropp'd acorn It may well be call'd Jove 's tree when it drops forth such fruit Give me audience good madam Proceed There lay he stretch'd along like a wounded knight Though it be pity to see such a sight it well becomes the ground Cry ' Holla ' to thy tongue I prithee it curvets unseasonably He was furnish'd like a hunter O ominous he comes to kill my heart I would sing my song without a burden thou bring'st me out of tune Do you not know I am a woman When I think I must speak Sweet say on You bring me out Soft comes he not here ' Tis he slink by and note him I thank you for your company but good faith I had as lief have been myself alone And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you too for your society God buy you let 's meet as little as we can I do desire we may be better strangers I pray you mar no more trees with writing love songs in their barks I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading them ill favouredly Rosalind is your love 's name Yes just I do not like her name There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen'd What stature is she of Just as high as my heart You are full of pretty answers Have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths ' wives and conn'd them out of rings Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from whence you have studied your questions You have a nimble wit I think ' twas made of Atalanta 's heels Will you sit down with me and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery I will chide no breather in the world but myself against whom I know most faults The worst fault you have is to be in love ' Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue I am weary of you By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found you He is drown'd in the brook look but in and you shall see him There I shall see mine own figure Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher I 'll tarry no longer with you farewell good Signior Love I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur Melancholy Aside to CELIA I will speak to him like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.- Do you hear forester Very well what would you I pray you what is't o'clock You should ask me what time o ' day there 's no clock in the forest Then there is no true lover in the forest else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock And why not the swift foot of Time Had not that been as proper By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with divers persons I 'll tell you who Time ambles withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops withal and who he stands still withal I prithee who doth he trot withal Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemniz'd if the interim be but a se'nnight Time 's pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year Who ambles Time withal With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because he can not study and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury These Time ambles withal Who doth he gallop withal With a thief to the gallows for though he go as softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there Who stays it still withal With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves Where dwell you pretty youth With this shepherdess my sister here in the skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat Are you native of this place As the coney that you see dwell where she is kindled Your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling I have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship too well for there he fell in love I have heard him read many lectures against it and I thank God I am not a woman to be touch'd with so many giddy offences as he hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal Can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women There were none principal they were all like one another as halfpence are every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it I prithee recount some of them No I will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick There is a man haunts the forest that abuses our young plants with carving ' Rosalind ' on their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of Rosalind If I could meet that fancy monger I would give him some good counsel for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him I am he that is so love shak'd I pray you tell me your remedy There is none of my uncle 's marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love in which cage of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner What were his marks A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and sunken which you have not an unquestionable spirit which you have not a beard neglected which you have not but I pardon you for that for simply your having in beard is a younger brother 's revenue Then your hose should be ungarter'd your bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbutton'd your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation But you are no such man you are rather point device in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love Me believe it You may as soon make her that you love believe it which I warrant she is apter to do than to confess she does That is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences But in good sooth are you he that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind is so admired I swear to thee youth by the white hand of Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel Did you ever cure any so Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me his love his mistress and I set him every day to woo me at which time would I being but a moonish youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing and liking proud fantastical apish shallow inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every passion something and for no passion truly anything as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe him then entertain him then forswear him now weep for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness which was to forswear the full stream of the world and to live in a nook merely monastic And thus I cur'd him and this way will I take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep 's heart that there shall not be one spot of love in ' t. I would not be cured youth I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me Now by the faith of my love I will Tell me where it is Go with me to it and I 'll show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live Will you go With all my heart good youth Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go Exeunt Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your goats Audrey And how Audrey am I the man yet Doth my simple feature content you Your features Lord warrant us What features I am here with thee and thy goats as the most capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths Aside O knowledge ill inhabited worse than Jove in a thatch'd house When a man 's verses can not be understood nor a man 's good wit seconded with the forward child understanding it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room Truly I would the gods had made thee poetical I do not know what ' poetical ' is Is it honest in deed and word Is it a true thing No truly for the truest poetry is the most feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical I do truly for thou swear'st to me thou art honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some hope thou didst feign Would you not have me honest No truly unless thou wert hard favour'd for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar Aside A material fool Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods make me honest Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul Well praised be the gods for thy foulness sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may be I will marry thee and to that end I have been with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next village who hath promis'd to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us Aside I would fain see this meeting Well the gods give us joy Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple but the wood no assembly but horn beasts But what though Courage As horns are odious they are necessary It is said ' Many a man knows no end of his goods ' Right Many a man has good horns and knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of his wife ' tis none of his own getting Horns Even so Poor men alone No no the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man therefore blessed No as a wall'd town is more worthier than a village so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor and by how much defence is better than no skill by so much is horn more precious than to want Here comes Sir Oliver Is there none here to give the woman I will not take her on gift of any man Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful Discovering himself Proceed proceed I 'll give her Good even good Master What ye call't how do you sir You are very well met Goddild you for your last company I am very glad to see you Even a toy in hand here sir Nay pray be cover'd Will you be married motley As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling And will you being a man of your breeding be married under a bush like a beggar Get you to church and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp Aside I am not in the mind but I were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well and not being well married it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife Go thou with me and let me counsel thee Come sweet Audrey We must be married or we must live in bawdry Farewell good Master Oliver Not- ' Tis no matter ne'er a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling Exit Never talk to me I will weep Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man But have I not cause to weep As good cause as one would desire therefore weep His very hair is of the dissembling colour Something browner than Judas 's Marry his kisses are Judas 's own children I ' faith his hair is of a good colour An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana A nun of winter 's sisterhood kisses not more religiously the very ice of chastity is in them But why did he swear he would come this morning and comes not Nay certainly there is no truth in him Do you think so Yes I think he is not a pick purse nor a horse stealer but for his verity in love I do think him as concave as covered goblet or a worm eaten nut Not true in love Yes when he is in but I think he is not in You have heard him swear downright he was ' Was ' is not ' is ' besides the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster they are both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends here in the forest on the Duke your father I met the Duke yesterday and had much question with him He asked me of what parentage I was I told him of as good as he so he laugh'd and let me go But what talk we of fathers when there is such a man as Orlando O that 's a brave man He writes brave verses speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of his lover as a puny tilter that spurs his horse but on one side breaks his staff like a noble goose But all 's brave that youth mounts and folly guides Who comes here Mistress and master you have oft enquired After the shepherd that complain'd of love Who you saw sitting by me on the turf Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess That was his mistress Well and what of him If you will see a pageant truly play'd Between the pale complexion of true love And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain Go hence a little and I shall conduct you If you will mark it O come let us remove The sight of lovers feedeth those in love Bring us to this sight and you shall say I 'll prove a busy actor in their play Exeunt Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe Say that you love me not but say not so In bitterness The common executioner Whose heart th ' accustom'd sight of death makes hard Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck But first begs pardon Will you sterner be Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops I would not be thy executioner I fly thee for I would not injure thee Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye ' Tis pretty sure and very probable That eyes that are the frail'st and softest things Who shut their coward gates on atomies Should be call'd tyrants butchers murderers Now I do frown on thee with all my heart And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains Some scar of it lean upon a rush The cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not Nor I am sure there is not force in eyes That can do hurt O dear Phebe If ever- as that ever may be near- You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy Then shall you know the wounds invisible That love 's keen arrows make But till that time Come not thou near me and when that time comes Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not As till that time I shall not pity thee Advancing And why I pray you Who might be your Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together I had rather hear you chide than this man woo He 's fall'n in love with your foulness and she 'll fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks I 'll sauce her with bitter words Why look you so upon me For no ill will I bear you I pray you do not fall in love with me For I am falser than vows made in wine Besides I like you not If you will know my house ' Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by Will you go sister Shepherd ply her hard Come sister Shepherdess look on him better And be not proud though all the world could see None could be so abus'd in sight as he Come to our flock Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN Dead shepherd now I find thy saw of might ' Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight ' Sweet Phebe Ha what say'st thou Silvius Sweet Phebe pity me Why I arn sorry for thee gentle Silvius Wherever sorrow is relief would be If you do sorrow at my grief in love By giving love your sorrow and my grief Were both extermin'd Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly I would have you Why that were covetousness Silvius the time was that I hated thee And yet it is not that I bear thee love But since that thou canst talk of love so well Thy company which erst was irksome to me I will endure and I 'll employ thee too But do not look for further recompense Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd So holy and so perfect is my love And I in such a poverty of grace That I shall think it a most plenteous crop To glean the broken ears after the man That the main harvest reaps loose now and then A scatt'red smile and that I 'll live upon Know'st thou the youth that spoke to me erewhile Not very well but I have met him oft And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds That the old carlot once was master of Think not I love him though I ask for him ' Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well But what care I for words Yet words do well When he that speaks them pleases those that hear It is a pretty youth- not very pretty But sure he 's proud and yet his pride becomes him He 'll make a proper man The best thing in him Is his complexion and faster than his tongue Did make offence his eye did heal it up He is not very tall yet for his years he 's tall His leg is but so so and yet ' tis well There was a pretty redness in his lip A little riper and more lusty red Than that mix'd in his cheek ' twas just the difference Betwixt the constant red and mingled damask There be some women Silvius had they mark'd him In parcels as I did would have gone near To fall in love with him but for my part I love him not nor hate him not and yet I have more cause to hate him than to love him For what had he to do to chide at me He said mine eyes were black and my hair black And now I am rememb'red scorn'd at me I marvel why I answer'd not again But that 's all one omittance is no quittance I 'll write to him a very taunting letter And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius Phebe with all my heart I 'll write it straight The matter 's in my head and in my heart I will be bitter with him and passing short Go with me Silvius Exeunt I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted with thee They say you are a melancholy fellow I am so I do love it better than laughing Those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards Why ' tis good to be sad and say nothing Why then ' tis good to be a post I have neither the scholar 's melancholy which is emulation nor the musician 's which is fantastical nor the courtier 's which is proud nor the soldier 's which is ambitious nor the lawyer 's which is politic nor the lady 's which is nice nor the lover 's which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples extracted from many objects and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels in which my often rumination wraps me in a most humorous sadness A traveller By my faith you have great reason to be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see other men 's then to have seen much and to have nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands Yes I have gain'd my experience And your experience makes you sad I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad- and to travel for it too Good day and happiness dear Rosalind Nay then God buy you an you talk in blank verse Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your own country be out of love with your nativity and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are or I will scarce think you have swam in a gondola Exit JAQUES Why how now Orlando where have you been all this while You a lover An you serve me such another trick never come in my sight more My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise Break an hour 's promise in love He that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapp'd him o ' th ' shoulder but I 'll warrant him heart whole Pardon me dear Rosalind Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I had as lief be woo'd of a snail Of a snail Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he carries his house on his head- a better jointure I think than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him What 's that Why horns which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife Virtue is no horn maker and my Rosalind is virtuous And I am your Rosalind It pleases him to call you so but he hath a Rosalind of a better leer than you Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent What would you say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind I would kiss before I spoke Nay you were better speak first and when you were gravell'd for lack of matter you might take occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are out they will spit and for lovers lacking- God warn us!- matter the cleanliest shift is to kiss How if the kiss be denied Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter Who could be out being before his beloved mistress Marry that should you if I were your mistress or I should think my honesty ranker than my wit What of my suit Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit Am not I your Rosalind I take some joy to say you are because I would be talking of her Well in her person I say I will not have you Then in mine own person I die No faith die by attorney The poor world is almost six thousand years old and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person videlicet in a love cause Troilus had his brains dash'd out with a Grecian club yet he did what he could to die before and he is one of the patterns of love Leander he would have liv'd many a fair year though Hero had turn'd nun if it had not been for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drown'd and the foolish chroniclers of that age found it was- Hero of Sestos But these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them but not for love I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind for I protest her frown might kill me By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now I will be your Rosalind in a more coming on disposition and ask me what you will I will grant it Then love me Rosalind Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all And wilt thou have me Ay and twenty such What sayest thou Are you not good I hope so Why then can one desire too much of a good thing Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister Pray thee marry us I can not say the words You must begin ' Will you Orlando'- Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind I will Ay but when Why now as fast as she can marry us Then you must say ' I take thee Rosalind for wife ' I take thee Rosalind for wife I might ask you for your commission but- I do take thee Orlando for my husband There 's a girl goes before the priest and certainly a woman 's thought runs before her actions So do all thoughts they are wing'd Now tell me how long you would have her after you have possess'd her For ever and a day Say ' a day ' without the ' ever ' No no Orlando men are April when they woo December when they we d maids are May when they are maids but the sky changes when they are wives I will be more jealous of thee than a Barbary cock pigeon over his hen more clamorous than a parrot against rain more new fangled than an ape more giddy in my desires than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana in the fountain and I will do that when you are dispos'd to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and that when thou are inclin'd to sleep But will my Rosalind do so By my life she will do as I do O but she is wise Or else she could not have the wit to do this The wiser the waywarder Make the doors upon a woman 's wit and it will out at the casement shut that and ' twill out at the key hole stop that ' twill fly with the smoke out at the chimney A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say ' Wit whither wilt ' ROSALIND Nay you might keep that check for it till you met your wife 's wit going to your neighbour 's bed And what wit could wit have to excuse that Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall never take her without her answer unless you take her without her tongue O that woman that can not make her fault her husband 's occasion let her never nurse her child herself for she will breed it like a fool For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee Alas dear love I can not lack thee two hours I must attend the Duke at dinner by two o'clock I will be with thee again Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you would prove my friends told me as much and I thought no less That flattering tongue of yours won me ' Tis but one cast away and so come death Two o'clock is your hour Ay sweet Rosalind By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour I will think you the most pathetical break promise and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful Therefore beware my censure and keep your promise With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my Rosalind so adieu Well Time is the old justice that examines all such offenders and let Time try Adieu Exit ORLANDO You have simply misus'd our sex in your love prate We must have your doublet and hose pluck'd over your head and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But it can not be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom like the Bay of Portugal Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour affection in it runs out No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought conceiv'd of spleen and born of madness that blind rascally boy that abuses every one 's eyes because his own are out- let him be judge how deep I am in love I 'll tell thee Aliena I can not be out of the sight of Orlando I 'll go find a shadow and sigh till he come And I 'll sleep Exeunt Which is he that killed the deer Sir it was I. Let 's present him to the Duke like a Roman conqueror and it would do well to set the deer 's horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have you no song forester for this purpose Yes sir Sing it ' tis no matter how it be in tune so it make noise enough How say you now Is it not past two o'clock And here much Orlando I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth- to sleep Look who comes here My errand is to you fair youth My gentle Phebe did bid me give you this I know not the contents but as I guess By the stern brow and waspish action Which she did use as she was writing of it It bears an angry tenour Pardon me I am but as a guiltless messenger Patience herself would startle at this letter And play the swaggerer Bear this bear all She says I am not fair that I lack manners She calls me proud and that she could not love me Were man as rare as Phoenix ' Od 's my will Her love is not the hare that I do hunt Why writes she so to me Well shepherd well This is a letter of your own device No I protest I know not the contents Phebe did write it Come come you are a fool And turn'd into the extremity of love I saw her hand she has a leathern hand A freestone colour'd hand I verily did think That her old gloves were on but ' twas her hands She has a huswife 's hand- but that 's no matter I say she never did invent this letter This is a man 's invention and his hand Sure it is hers Why ' tis a boisterous and a cruel style A style for challengers Why she defies me Like Turk to Christian Women 's gentle brain Could not drop forth such giant rude invention Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter So please you for I never heard it yet Yet heard too much of Phebe 's cruelty She Phebes me mark how the tyrant writes Call you this railing ' Why thy godhead laid apart Call you this chiding Alas poor shepherd Do you pity him No he deserves no pity Wilt thou love such a woman What to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee Not to be endur'd Well go your way to her for I see love hath made thee tame snake and say this to her- that if she love me I charge her to love thee if she will not I will never have her unless thou entreat for her If you be a true lover hence and not a word for here comes more company Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know Where in the purlieus of this forest stands A sheep cote fenc'd about with olive trees West of this place down in the neighbour bottom The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream Left on your right hand brings you to the place But at this hour the house doth keep itself There 's none within If that an eye may profit by a tongue Then should I know you by description- Such garments and such years ' The boy is fair Of female favour and bestows himself Like a ripe sister the woman low And browner than her brother ' Are not you The owner of the house I did inquire for It is no boast being ask'd to say we are Orlando doth commend him to you both And to that youth he calls his Rosalind He sends this bloody napkin Are you he I am What must we understand by this Some of my shame if you will know of me What man I am and how and why and where This handkercher was stain'd I pray you tell it When last the young Orlando parted from you He left a promise to return again Within an hour and pacing through the forest Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy Lo what befell He threw his eye aside And mark what object did present itself Under an oak whose boughs were moss'd with age And high top bald with dry antiquity A wretched ragged man o'ergrown with hair Lay sleeping on his back About his neck A green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd The opening of his mouth but suddenly Seeing Orlando it unlink'd itself And with indented glides did slip away Into a bush under which bush 's shade A lioness with udders all drawn dry Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir for ' tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead This seen Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother his elder brother O I have heard him speak of that same brother And he did render him the most unnatural That liv'd amongst men And well he might so do For well I know he was unnatural But to Orlando did he leave him there Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness Twice did he turn his back and purpos'd so But kindness nobler ever than revenge And nature stronger than his just occasion Made him give battle to the lioness Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awak'd Are you his brother Was't you he rescu'd Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him ' Twas I but ' tis not I. I do not shame To tell you what I was since my conversion So sweetly tastes being the thing I am But for the bloody napkin By and by When from the first to last betwixt us two Tears our recountments had most kindly bath'd As how I came into that desert place- In brief he led me to the gentle Duke Who gave me fresh array and entertainment Committing me unto my brother 's love Who led me instantly unto his cave There stripp'd himself and here upon his arm The lioness had torn some flesh away Which all this while had bled and now he fainted And cried in fainting upon Rosalind Brief I recover'd him bound up his wound And after some small space being strong at heart He sent me hither stranger as I am To tell this story that you might excuse His broken promise and to give this napkin Dy'd in his blood unto the shepherd youth That he in sport doth call his Rosalind Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede Many will swoon when they do look on blood There is more in it Cousin Ganymede Look he recovers I would I were at home We 'll lead you thither I pray you will you take him by the arm Be of good cheer youth You a man You lack a man 's heart I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited Heigh ho This was not counterfeit there is too great testimony in your complexion that it was a passion of earnest Counterfeit I assure you Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man So I do but i ' faith I should have been a woman by right Come you look paler and paler pray you draw homewards Good sir go with us That will I for I must bear answer back How you excuse my brother Rosalind I shall devise something but I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him Will you go Exeunt We shall find a time Audrey patience gentle Audrey Faith the priest was good enough for all the old gentleman 's saying A most wicked Sir Oliver Audrey a most vile Martext But Audrey there is a youth here in the forest lays claim to you Ay I know who ' tis he hath no interest in me in the world here comes the man you mean It is meat and drink to me to see a clown By my troth we that have good wits have much to answer for we shall be flouting we can not hold Good ev'n Audrey God ye good ev'n William And good ev'n to you sir Good ev'n gentle friend Cover thy head cover thy head nay prithee be cover'd How old are you friend Five and twenty sir A ripe age Is thy name William William sir A fair name Wast born i ' th ' forest here Ay sir I thank God ' Thank God ' A good answer Art rich Faith sir so so ' So so ' is good very good very excellent good and yet it is not it is but so so Art thou wise Ay sir I have a pretty wit Why thou say'st well I do now remember a saying ' The fool doth think he is wise but the wise man knows himself to be a fool ' The heathen philosopher when he had a desire to eat a grape would open his lips when he put it into his mouth meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and lips to open You do love this maid I do sir Give me your hand Art thou learned No sir Then learn this of me to have is to have for it is a figure in rhetoric that drink being pour'd out of cup into a glass by filling the one doth empty the other for all your writers do consent that ipse is he now you are not ipse for I am he Which he sir He sir that must marry this woman Therefore you clown abandon- which is in the vulgar leave- the society- which in the boorish is company- of this female- which in the common is woman- which together is abandon the society of this female or clown thou perishest or to thy better understanding diest or to wit I kill thee make thee away translate thy life into death thy liberty into bondage I will deal in poison with thee or in bastinado or in steel I will bandy with thee in faction will o'er run thee with policy I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways therefore tremble and depart Do good William God rest you merry sir Exit Our master and mistress seeks you come away away Trip Audrey trip Audrey I attend I attend Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you should like her that but seeing you should love her and loving woo and wooing she should grant and will you persever to enjoy her Neither call the giddiness of it in question the poverty of her the small acquaintance my sudden wooing nor her sudden consenting but say with me I love Aliena say with her that she loves me consent with both that we may enjoy each other It shall be to your good for my father 's house and all the revenue that was old Sir Rowland 's will I estate upon you and here live and die a shepherd You have my consent Let your wedding be to morrow Thither will I invite the Duke and all 's contented followers Go you and prepare Aliena for look you here comes my Rosalind God save you brother And you fair sister Exit O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf It is my arm I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion Wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to swoon when he show'd me your handkercher Ay and greater wonders than that O I know where you are Nay ' tis true There was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and Caesar 's thrasonical brag of ' I came saw and overcame ' For your brother and my sister no sooner met but they look'd no sooner look'd but they lov'd no sooner lov'd but they sigh'd no sooner sigh'd but they ask'd one another the reason no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy- and in these degrees have they made pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent or else be incontinent before marriage They are in the very wrath of love and they will together Clubs can not part them They shall be married to morrow and I will bid the Duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man 's eyes By so much the more shall I to morrow be at the height of heart heaviness by how much I shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for Why then to morrow I can not serve your turn for Rosalind I can live no longer by thinking I will weary you then no longer with idle talking Know of me then- for now I speak to some purpose- that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you to do yourself good and not to grace me Believe then if you please that I can do strange things I have since I was three year old convers'd with a magician most profound in his art and yet not damnable If you do love Rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out when your brother marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into what straits of fortune she is driven and it is not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient to you to set her before your eyes to morrow human as she is and without any danger Speak'st thou in sober meanings By my life I do which I tender dearly though I say I am a magician Therefore put you in your best array bid your friends for if you will be married to morrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will Youth you have done me much ungentleness To show the letter that I writ to you I care not if I have It is my study To seem despiteful and ungentle to you You are there follow'd by a faithful shepherd Look upon him love him he worships you Good shepherd tell this youth what ' tis to love It is to be all made of sighs and tears And so am I for Phebe And I for Ganymede And I for Rosalind And I for no woman It is to be all made of faith and service And so am I for Phebe And I for Ganymede And I for Rosalind And I for no woman It is to be all made of fantasy All made of passion and all made of wishes All adoration duty and observance All humbleness all patience and impatience All purity all trial all obedience And so am I for Phebe And so am I for Ganymede And so am I for Rosalind And so am I for no woman If this be so why blame you me to love you If this be so why blame you me to love you If this be so why blame you me to love you Why do you speak too ' Why blame you me to love you ' To her that is not here nor doth not hear Pray you no more of this ' tis like the howling of Irish wolves against the moon To SILVIUS I will help you if I can To PHEBE I would love you if I could.- To morrow meet me all together To PHEBE I will marry you if ever I marry woman and I 'll be married to morrow To ORLANDO I will satisfy you if ever I satisfied man and you shall be married to morrow To Silvius I will content you if what pleases you contents you and you shall be married to morrow To ORLANDO As you love Rosalind meet To SILVIUS As you love Phebe meet;- and as I love no woman I 'll meet So fare you well I have left you commands I 'll not fail if I live Nor I. Nor I. Exeunt To morrow is the joyful day Audre'y to morrow will we be married I do desire it with all my heart and I hope it is no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the world Here come two of the banish'd Duke 's pages Well met honest gentleman By my troth well met Come sit sit and a song We are for you sit i ' th ' middle Shall we clap into't roundly without hawking or spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only prologues to a bad voice I'faith i'faith and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse Truly young gentlemen though there was no great matter in the ditty yet the note was very untuneable YOU are deceiv'd sir we kept time we lost not our time By my troth yes I count it but time lost to hear such a foolish song God buy you and God mend your voices Come Audrey Exeunt Dost thou believe Orlando that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not As those that fear they hope and know they fear Patience once more whiles our compact is urg'd You say if I bring in your Rosalind You will bestow her on Orlando here That would I had I kingdoms to give with her And you say you will have her when I bring her That would I were I of all kingdoms king You say you 'll marry me if I be willing That will I should I die the hour after But if you do refuse to marry me You 'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd So is the bargain You say that you 'll have Phebe if she will Though to have her and death were both one thing I have promis'd to make all this matter even Keep you your word O Duke to give your daughter You yours Orlando to receive his daughter Keep your word Phebe that you 'll marry me Or else refusing me to we d this shepherd Keep your word Silvius that you 'll marry her If she refuse me and from hence I go To make these doubts all even I do remember in this shepherd boy Some lively touches of my daughter 's favour My lord the first time that I ever saw him Methought he was a brother to your daughter But my good lord this boy is forest born And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments Of many desperate studies by his uncle Whom he reports to be a great magician Obscured in the circle of this forest There is sure another flood toward and these couples are coming to the ark Here comes a pair of very strange beasts which in all tongues are call'd fools Salutation and greeting to you all Good my lord bid him welcome This is the motley minded gentleman that I have so often met in the forest He hath been a If any man doubt that let him put me to my purgation I have trod a measure I have flatt'red a lady I have been politic with my friend smooth with mine enemy I have undone three tailors I have had four quarrels and like to have fought one And how was that ta'en up Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause How seventh cause Good my lord like this fellow I like him very well God ' ild you sir I desire you of the like I press in here sir amongst the rest of the country copulatives to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks A poor virgin sir an ill favour'd thing sir but mine own a poor humour of mine sir to take that that man else will Rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster By my faith he is very swift and sententious According to the fool 's bolt sir and such dulcet diseases But for the seventh cause how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause Upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more seeming Audrey- as thus sir I did dislike the cut of a certain courtier 's beard he sent me word if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the mind it was This is call'd the Retort Courteous If I sent him word again it was not well cut he would send me word he cut it to please himself This is call'd the Quip Modest If again it was not well cut he disabled my judgment This is call'd the Reply Churlish If again it was not well cut he would answer I spake not true This is call'd the Reproof Valiant If again it was not well cut he would say I lie This is call'd the Countercheck Quarrelsome And so to the Lie Circumstantial and the Lie Direct And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct and so we measur'd swords and parted Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have books for good manners I will name you the degrees The first the Retort Courteous the second the Quip Modest the third the Reply Churlish the fourth the Reproof Valiant the fifth the Countercheck Quarrelsome the sixth the Lie with Circumstance the seventh the Lie Direct All these you may avoid but the Lie Direct and you may avoid that too with an If I knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel but when the parties were met themselves one of them thought but of an If as ' If you said so then I said so ' And they shook hands and swore brothers Your If is the only peace maker much virtue in If Is not this a rare fellow my lord He 's as good at any thing and yet a fool He uses his folly like a stalking horse and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit To DUKE To you I give myself for I am yours To ORLANDO To you I give myself for I am yours If there be truth in sight you are my daughter If there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind If sight and shape be true Why then my love adieu I 'll have no father if you be not he I 'll have no husband if you be not he Nor ne'er we d woman if you be not she Peace ho I bar confusion O my dear niece welcome thou art to me Even daughter welcome in no less degree I will not eat my word now thou art mine Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine Welcome young man Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers ' wedding To one his lands withheld and to the other A land itself at large a potent dukedom First in this forest let us do those ends That here were well begun and well begot And after every of this happy number That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us Shall share the good of our returned fortune According to the measure of their states Meantime forget this new fall'n dignity And fall into our rustic revelry Play music and you brides and bridegrooms all With measure heap'd in joy to th ' measures fall Sir by your patience If I heard you rightly The Duke hath put on a religious life And thrown into neglect the pompous court He hath To him will I. Out of these convertites There is much matter to be heard and learn'd To DUKE You to your former honour I bequeath Your patience and your virtue well deserves it To ORLANDO You to a love that your true faith doth merit To OLIVER You to your land and love and great allies To SILVIUS You to a long and well deserved bed To TOUCHSTONE And you to wrangling for thy loving voyage Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures I am for other than for dancing measures Stay Jaques stay To see no pastime I. What you would have I 'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave Exit Proceed proceed We will begin these rites As we do trust they 'll end in true delights A dance Exeunt It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue If it be true that good wine needs no bush ' tis true that a good play needs no epilogue Yet to good wine they do use good bushes and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues What a case am I in then that am neither a good epilogue nor can not insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play I am not furnish'd like a beggar therefore to beg will not become me My way is to conjure you and I 'll begin with the women I charge you O women for the love you bear to men to like as much of this play as please you and I charge you O men for the love you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you hates them- that between you and the women the play may please If I were a woman I would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleas'd me complexions that lik'd me and breaths that I defied not and I am sure as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell Come on sir knave have done your foolishness Before we proceed any further hear me speak Speak speak YOU are all resolv'd rather to die than to famish Resolv'd resolv'd First you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people We know't we know't Let us kill him and we 'll have corn at our own price Is't a verdict No more talking on't let it be done Away away One word good citizens We are accounted poor citizens the patricians good What authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity while it were wholesome we might guess they relieved us humanely but they think we are too dear The leanness that afflicts us the object of our misery is as an inventory to particularize their abundance our sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with our pikes ere we become rakes for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread not in thirst for revenge Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius Against him first he 's a very dog to the commonalty Consider you what services he has done for his country Very well and could be content to give him good report for't but that he pays himself with being proud Nay but speak not maliciously I say unto you what he hath done famously he did it to that end though soft conscienc'd men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud which he is even to the altitude of his virtue What he can not help in his nature you account a vice in him You must in no way say he is covetous If I must not I need not be barren of accusations he hath faults with surplus to tire in repetition Shouts within What shouts are these The other side o ' th ' city is risen Why stay we prating here To th ' Capitol Come come Soft who comes here Worthy Menenius Agrippa one that hath always lov'd the people He 's one honest enough would all the rest were so What work 's my countrymen in hand Where go you With bats and clubs The matter Speak I pray you Our business is not unknown to th ' Senate they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do which now we 'll show 'em in deeds They say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too Why masters my good friends mine honest neighbours Will you undo yourselves We can not sir we are undone already I tell you friends most charitable care Have the patricians of you For your wants Your suffering in this dearth you may as well Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them Against the Roman state whose course will on The way it takes cracking ten thousand curbs Of more strong link asunder than can ever Appear in your impediment For the dearth The gods not the patricians make it and Your knees to them not arms must help Alack You are transported by calamity Thither where more attends you and you slander The helms o ' th ' state who care for you like fathers When you curse them as enemies Care for us True indeed They ne'er car'd for us yet Suffer us to famish and their storehouses cramm'd with grain make edicts for usury to support usurers repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich and provide more piercing statutes daily to chain up and restrain the poor If the wars eat us not up they will and there 's all the love they bear us Either you must Confess yourselves wondrous malicious Or be accus'd of folly I shall tell you A pretty tale It may be you have heard it But since it serves my purpose I will venture To stale't a little more Well I 'll hear it sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale But an't please you deliver There was a time when all the body 's members Rebell'd against the belly thus accus'd it That only like a gulf it did remain I ' th ' midst o ' th ' body idle and unactive Still cupboarding the viand never bearing Like labour with the rest where th ' other instruments Did see and hear devise instruct walk feel And mutually participate did minister Unto the appetite and affection common Of the whole body The belly answer'd- Well sir what answer made the belly Sir I shall tell you With a kind of smile Which ne'er came from the lungs but even thus- For look you I may make the belly smile As well as speak- it tauntingly replied To th ' discontented members the mutinous parts That envied his receipt even so most fitly As you malign our senators for that They are not such as you Your belly 's answer- What The kingly crowned head the vigilant eye The counsellor heart the arm our soldier Our steed the leg the tongue our trumpeter With other muniments and petty helps Is this our fabric if that they- What then Fore me this fellow speaks What then What then Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd Who is the sink o ' th ' body- Well what then The former agents if they did complain What could the belly answer I will tell you If you 'll bestow a small- of what you have little- Patience awhile you'st hear the belly 's answer Y'are long about it Note me this good friend Your most grave belly was deliberate Not rash like his accusers and thus answered ' True is it my incorporate friends ' quoth he ' That I receive the general food at first Which you do live upon and fit it is Because I am the storehouse and the shop Of the whole body But if you do remember I send it through the rivers of your blood Even to the court the heart to th ' seat o ' th ' brain And through the cranks and offices of man The strongest nerves and small inferior veins From me receive that natural competency Whereby they live And though that all at once You my good friends'- this says the belly mark me Ay sir well well ' Though all at once can not See what I do deliver out to each Yet I can make my audit up that all From me do back receive the flour of all And leave me but the bran ' What say you to ' t It was an answer How apply you this The senators of Rome are this good belly And you the mutinous members for examine Their counsels and their cares digest things rightly Touching the weal o ' th ' common you shall find No public benefit which you receive But it proceeds or comes from them to you And no way from yourselves What do you think You the great toe of this assembly I the great toe Why the great toe For that being one o ' th ' lowest basest poorest Of this most wise rebellion thou goest foremost Thou rascal that art worst in blood to run Lead'st first to win some vantage But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs Rome and her rats are at the point of battle The one side must have bale Thanks What 's the matter you dissentious rogues That rubbing the poor itch of your opinion Make yourselves scabs We have ever your good word He that will give good words to thee will flatter Beneath abhorring What would you have you curs That like nor peace nor war The one affrights you The other makes you proud He that trusts to you Where he should find you lions finds you hares Where foxes geese you are no surer no Than is the coal of fire upon the ice Or hailstone in the sun Your virtue is To make him worthy whose offence subdues him And curse that justice did it Who deserves greatness Deserves your hate and your affections are A sick man 's appetite who desires most that Which would increase his evil He that depends Upon your favours swims with fins of lead And hews down oaks with rushes Hang ye Trust ye With every minute you do change a mind And call him noble that was now your hate Him vile that was your garland What 's the matter That in these several places of the city You cry against the noble Senate who Under the gods keep you in awe which else Would feed on one another What 's their seeking For corn at their own rates whereof they say The city is well stor'd Hang 'em They say They 'll sit by th ' fire and presume to know What 's done i ' th ' Capitol who 's like to rise Who thrives and who declines side factions and give out Conjectural marriages making parties strong And feebling such as stand not in their liking Below their cobbled shoes They say there 's grain enough Would the nobility lay aside their ruth And let me use my sword I 'd make a quarry With thousands of these quarter'd slaves as high As I could pick my lance Nay these are almost thoroughly persuaded For though abundantly they lack discretion Yet are they passing cowardly But I beseech you What says the other troop They are dissolv'd Hang 'em They said they were an hungry sigh'd forth proverbs- That hunger broke stone walls that dogs must eat That meat was made for mouths that the gods sent not Corn for the rich men only With these shreds They vented their complainings which being answer'd And a petition granted them- a strange one To break the heart of generosity And make bold power look pale- they threw their caps As they would hang them on the horns o ' th ' moon Shouting their emulation What is granted them Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms Of their own choice One 's Junius Brutus- Sicinius Velutus and I know not ' Sdeath The rabble should have first unroof'd the city Ere so prevail'd with me it will in time Win upon power and throw forth greater themes For insurrection 's arguing This is strange Go get you home you fragments Where 's Caius Marcius Here What 's the matter The news is sir the Volsces are in arms I am glad on't then we shall ha ' means to vent Our musty superfluity See our best elders Marcius ' tis true that you have lately told us The Volsces are in arms They have a leader Tullus Aufidius that will put you to't I sin in envying his nobility And were I anything but what I am I would wish me only he You have fought together Were half to half the world by th ' ears and he Upon my party I 'd revolt to make Only my wars with him He is a lion That I am proud to hunt Then worthy Marcius Attend upon Cominius to these wars It is your former promise Sir it is And I am constant Titus Lartius thou Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus ' face What art thou stiff Stand'st out No Caius Marcius I 'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other Ere stay behind this business O true bred Your company to th ' Capitol where I know Our greatest friends attend us To COMINIUS Lead you on To MARCIUS Follow Cominius we must follow you Right worthy you priority Noble Marcius To the Citizens Hence to your homes be gone Nay let them follow The Volsces have much corn take these rats thither To gnaw their garners Worshipful mutineers Your valour puts well forth pray follow Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius He has no equal When we were chosen tribunes for the people- Mark'd you his lip and eyes Nay but his taunts Being mov'd he will not spare to gird the gods Bemock the modest moon The present wars devour him He is grown Too proud to be so valiant Such a nature Tickled with good success disdains the shadow Which he treads on at noon But I do wonder His insolence can brook to be commanded Under Cominius Fame at the which he aims- In whom already he is well grac'd- can not Better be held nor more attain'd than by A place below the first for what miscarries Shall be the general 's fault though he perform To th ' utmost of a man and giddy censure Will then cry out of Marcius ' O if he Had borne the business ' Besides if things go well Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall Of his demerits rob Cominius Come Half all Cominius ' honours are to Marcius Though Marcius earn'd them not and all his faults To Marcius shall be honours though indeed In aught he merit not Let 's hence and hear How the dispatch is made and in what fashion More than his singularity he goes Upon this present action Let 's along Exeunt So your opinion is Aufidius That they of Rome are ent'red in our counsels And know how we proceed Is it not yours What ever have been thought on in this state That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome Had circumvention ' Tis not four days gone Since I heard thence these are the words- I think I have the letter here;.yes here it is Reads ' They have press'd a power but it is not known Whether for east or west The dearth is great The people mutinous and it is rumour'd Cominius Marcius your old enemy Who is of Rome worse hated than of you And Titus Lartius a most valiant Roman These three lead on this preparation Whither ' tis bent Most likely ' tis for you Consider of it ' Our army 's in the field We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready To answer us Nor did you think it folly To keep your great pretences veil'd till when They needs must show themselves which in the hatching It seem'd appear'd to Rome By the discovery We shall be short'ned in our aim which was To take in many towns ere almost Rome Should know we were afoot Noble Aufidius Take your commission hie you to your bands Let us alone to guard Corioli If they set down before 's for the remove Bring up your army but I think you 'll find Th ' have not prepar'd for us O doubt not that I speak from certainties Nay more Some parcels of their power are forth already And only hitherward I leave your honours If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet ' Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike Till one can do no more The gods assist you And keep your honours safe Farewell Farewell Farewell Exeunt I pray you daughter sing or express yourself in a more comfortable sort If my son were my husband I should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love When yet he was but tender bodied and the only son of my womb when youth with comeliness pluck'd all gaze his way when for a day of kings ' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding I considering how honour would become such a person- that it was no better than picture like to hang by th ' wall if renown made it not stir- was pleas'd to let him seek danger where he was to find fame To a cruel war I sent him from whence he return'd his brows bound with oak I tell thee daughter I sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man child than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man But had he died in the business madam how then Then his good report should have been my son I therein would have found issue Hear me profess sincerely had I a dozen sons each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good Marcius I had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action Madam the Lady Valeria is come to visit you Beseech you give me leave to retire myself Indeed you shall not Methinks I hear hither your husband 's drum See him pluck Aufidius down by th ' hair As children from a bear the Volsces shunning him Methinks I see him stamp thus and call thus ' Come on you cowards You were got in fear Though you were born in Rome ' His bloody brow With his mail'd hand then wiping forth he goes Like to a harvest man that 's task'd to mow Or all or lose his hire His bloody brow O Jupiter no blood Away you fool It more becomes a man Than gilt his trophy The breasts of Hecuba When she did suckle Hector look'd not lovelier Than Hector 's forehead when it spit forth blood At Grecian sword contemning Tell Valeria We are fit to bid her welcome Exit GENTLEWOMAN Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius He 'll beat Aufidius ' head below his knee And tread upon his neck My ladies both good day to you Sweet madam I am glad to see your ladyship How do you both You are manifest housekeepers What are you sewing here A fine spot in good faith How does your little son I thank your ladyship well good madam He had rather see the swords and hear a drum than look upon his schoolmaster O ' my word the father 's son I 'll swear ' tis a very pretty boy O ' my troth I look'd upon him a Wednesday half an hour together has such a confirm'd countenance I saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it he let it go again and after it again and over and over he comes and up again catch'd it again or whether his fall enrag'd him or how ' twas he did so set his teeth and tear it O I warrant how he mammock'd it One on 's father 's moods Indeed la ' tis a noble child A crack madam Come lay aside your stitchery I must have you play the idle huswife with me this afternoon No good madam I will not out of doors Not out of doors She shall she shall Indeed no by your patience I 'll not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars Fie you confine yourself most unreasonably come you must go visit the good lady that lies in I will wish her speedy strength and visit her with my prayers but I can not go thither Why I pray you ' Tis not to save labour nor that I want love You would be another Penelope yet they say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses ' absence did but fill Ithaca full of moths Come I would your cambric were sensible as your finger that you might leave pricking it for pity Come you shall go with us No good madam pardon me indeed I will not forth In truth la go with me and I 'll tell you excellent news of your husband O good madam there can be none yet Verily I do not jest with you there came news from him last night Indeed madam In earnest it 's true I heard a senator speak it Thus it is the Volsces have an army forth against whom Cominius the general is gone with one part of our Roman power Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down before their city Corioli they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars This is true on mine honour and so I pray go with us Give me excuse good madam I will obey you in everything hereafter Let her alone lady as she is now she will but disease our better mirth In troth I think she would Fare you well then Come good sweet lady Prithee Virgilia turn thy solemness out o ' door and go along with us No at a word madam indeed I must not I wish you much mirth Well then farewell Exeunt Yonder comes news a wager- they have met My horse to yours- no ' Tis done Agreed Say has our general met the enemy They lie in view but have not spoke as yet So the good horse is mine I 'll buy him of you No I 'll nor sell nor give him lend you him I will For half a hundred years Summon the town How far off lie these armies Within this mile and half Then shall we hear their ' larum and they ours Now Mars I prithee make us quick in work That we with smoking swords may march from hence To help our fielded friends Come blow thy blast No nor a man that fears you less than he That 's lesser than a little Drum afar off Hark our drums Are bringing forth our youth We 'll break our walls Rather than they shall pound us up our gates Which yet seem shut we have but pinn'd with rushes They 'll open of themselves Alarum far off Hark you far off There is Aufidius List what work he makes Amongst your cloven army O they are at it Their noise be our instruction Ladders ho They fear us not but issue forth their city Now put your shields before your hearts and fight With hearts more proof than shields Advance brave Titus They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts Which makes me sweat with wrath Come on my fellows He that retires I 'll take him for a Volsce And he shall feel mine edge All the contagion of the south light on you You shames of Rome you herd of- Boils and plagues Plaster you o'er that you may be abhorr'd Farther than seen and one infect another Against the wind a mile You souls of geese That bear the shapes of men how have you run From slaves that apes would beat Pluto and hell All hurt behind Backs red and faces pale With flight and agued fear Mend and charge home Or by the fires of heaven I 'll leave the foe And make my wars on you Look to't Come on If you 'll stand fast we 'll beat them to their wives As they us to our trenches Follow me Fool hardiness not I. Not I. MARCIUS is shut in See they have shut him in To th ' pot I warrant him Alarum continues What is become of Marcius Slain sir doubtless Following the fliers at the very heels With them he enters who upon the sudden Clapp'd to their gates He is himself alone To answer all the city O noble fellow Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword And when it bows stand'st up Thou art left Marcius A carbuncle entire as big as thou art Were not so rich a jewel Thou wast a soldier Even to Cato 's wish not fierce and terrible Only in strokes but with thy grim looks and The thunder like percussion of thy sounds Thou mad'st thine enemies shake as if the world Were feverous and did tremble Look sir O ' tis Marcius Let 's fetch him off or make remain alike This will I carry to Rome And I this A murrain on ' t I took this for silver See here these movers that do prize their hours At a crack'd drachma Cushions leaden spoons Irons of a doit doublets that hangmen would Bury with those that wore them these base slaves Ere yet the fight be done pack up Down with them Worthy sir thou bleed'st Thy exercise hath been too violent For a second course of fight Sir praise me not My work hath yet not warm'd me Fare you well The blood I drop is rather physical Than dangerous to me To Aufidius thus I will appear and fight Now the fair goddess Fortune Fall deep in love with thee and her great charms Misguide thy opposers ' swords Bold gentleman Prosperity be thy page Thy friend no less Than those she placeth highest So farewell Thou worthiest Marcius Exit MARCIUS Go sound thy trumpet in the market place Call thither all the officers o ' th ' town Where they shall know our mind Away Exeunt Breathe you my friends Well fought we are come off Like Romans neither foolish in our stands Nor cowardly in retire Believe me sirs We shall be charg'd again Whiles we have struck By interims and conveying gusts we have heard The charges of our friends The Roman gods Lead their successes as we wish our own That both our powers with smiling fronts encount'ring May give you thankful sacrifice The citizens of Corioli have issued And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle I saw our party to their trenches driven And then I came away Though thou speak'st truth Methinks thou speak'st not well How long is't since Above an hour my lord ' Tis not a mile briefly we heard their drums How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour And bring thy news so late Spies of the Volsces Held me in chase that I was forc'd to wheel Three or four miles about else had I sir Half an hour since brought my report Who 's yonder That does appear as he were flay'd O gods He has the stamp of Marcius and I have Before time seen him thus Come I too late The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabor More than I know the sound of Marcius ' tongue From every meaner man Come I too late Ay if you come not in the blood of others But mantled in your own O let me clip ye In arms as sound as when I woo'd in heart As merry as when our nuptial day was done And tapers burn'd to bedward Flower of warriors How is't with Titus Lartius As with a man busied about decrees Condemning some to death and some to exile Ransoming him or pitying threat'ning th ' other Holding Corioli in the name of Rome Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash To let him slip at will Where is that slave Which told me they had beat you to your trenches Where is he Call him hither Let him alone He did inform the truth But for our gentlemen The common file- a plague tribunes for them The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge From rascals worse than they But how prevail'd you Will the time serve to tell I do not think Where is the enemy Are you lords o ' th ' field If not why cease you till you are so Marcius We have at disadvantage fought and did Retire to win our purpose How lies their battle Know you on which side They have plac'd their men of trust As I guess Marcius Their bands i ' th ' vaward are the Antiates Of their best trust o'er them Aufidius Their very heart of hope I do beseech you By all the battles wherein we have fought By th ' blood we have shed together by th ' vows We have made to endure friends that you directly Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates And that you not delay the present but Filling the air with swords advanc'd and darts We prove this very hour Though I could wish You were conducted to a gentle bath And balms applied to you yet dare I never Deny your asking take your choice of those That best can aid your action Those are they That most are willing If any such be here- As it were sin to doubt- that love this painting Wherein you see me smear'd if any fear Lesser his person than an ill report If any think brave death outweighs bad life And that his country 's dearer than himself Let him alone or so many so minded Wave thus to express his disposition And follow Marcius They all shout and wave their March on my fellows Make good this ostentation and you shall Divide in all with us Exeunt So let the ports be guarded keep your duties As I have set them down If I do send dispatch Those centuries to our aid the rest will serve For a short holding If we lose the field We can not keep the town Fear not our care sir Hence and shut your gates upon 's Our guider come to th ' Roman camp conduct us Exeunt I 'll fight with none but thee for I do hate thee Worse than a promise breaker We hate alike Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor More than thy fame and envy Fix thy foot Let the first budger die the other 's slave And the gods doom him after If I fly Marcius Halloa me like a hare Within these three hours Tullus Alone I fought in your Corioli walls And made what work I pleas'd ' Tis not my blood Wherein thou seest me mask'd For thy revenge Wrench up thy power to th ' highest Wert thou the Hector That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny Thou shouldst not scape me here If I should tell thee o'er this thy day 's work Thou't not believe thy deeds but I 'll report it Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles Where great patricians shall attend and shrug I ' th ' end admire where ladies shall be frighted And gladly quak'd hear more where the dull tribunes That with the fusty plebeians hate thine honours Shall say against their hearts ' We thank the gods Our Rome hath such a soldier ' Yet cam'st thou to a morsel of this feast Having fully din'd before O General Here is the steed we the caparison Hadst thou beheld- Pray now no more my mother Who has a charter to extol her blood When she does praise me grieves me I have done As you have done- that 's what I can induc'd As you have been- that 's for my country He that has but effected his good will Hath overta'en mine act You shall not be The grave of your deserving Rome must know The value of her own ' Twere a concealment Worse than a theft no less than a traducement To hide your doings and to silence that Which to the spire and top of praises vouch'd Would seem but modest Therefore I beseech you In sign of what you are not to reward What you have done before our army hear me I have some wounds upon me and they smart To hear themselves rememb'red Should they not Well might they fester ' gainst ingratitude And tent themselves with death Of all the horses- Whereof we have ta'en good and good store- of all The treasure in this field achiev'd and city We render you the tenth to be ta'en forth Before the common distribution at Your only choice I thank you General But can not make my heart consent to take A bribe to pay my sword I do refuse it And stand upon my common part with those That have beheld the doing Too modest are you More cruel to your good report than grateful To us that give you truly By your patience If ' gainst yourself you be incens'd we 'll put you- Like one that means his proper harm- in manacles Then reason safely with you Therefore be it known As to us to all the world that Caius Marcius Wears this war 's garland in token of the which My noble steed known to the camp I give him With all his trim belonging and from this time For what he did before Corioli can him With all th ' applause and clamour of the host Caius Marcius Coriolanus Bear th ' addition nobly ever Caius Marcius Coriolanus I will go wash And when my face is fair you shall perceive Whether I blush or no Howbeit I thank you I mean to stride your steed and at all times To undercrest your good addition To th ' fairness of my power So to our tent Where ere we do repose us we will write To Rome of our success You Titus Lartius Must to Corioli back Send us to Rome The best with whom we may articulate For their own good and ours I shall my lord The gods begin to mock me I that now Refus'd most princely gifts am bound to beg Of my Lord General Take't- ' tis yours what is't I sometime lay here in Corioli At a poor man 's house he us'd me kindly He cried to me I saw him prisoner But then Aufidius was within my view And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity I request you To give my poor host freedom O well begg'd Were he the butcher of my son he should Be free as is the wind Deliver him Titus Marcius his name By Jupiter forgot I am weary yea my memory is tir'd Have we no wine here Go we to our tent The blood upon your visage dries ' tis time It should be look'd to Come Exeunt The town is ta'en ' Twill be deliver'd back on good condition Condition I would I were a Roman for I can not Being a Volsce be that I am Condition What good condition can a treaty find I ' th ' part that is at mercy Five times Marcius I have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me And wouldst do so I think should we encounter As often as we eat By th ' elements If e'er again I meet him beard to beard He 's mine or I am his Mine emulation Hath not that honour in't it had for where I thought to crush him in an equal force True sword to sword I 'll potch at him some way Or wrath or craft may get him He 's the devil Bolder though not so subtle My valour 's poison'd With only suff'ring stain by him for him Shall fly out of itself Nor sleep nor sanctuary Being naked sick nor fane nor Capitol The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice Embarquements all of fury shall lift up Their rotten privilege and custom ' gainst My hate to Marcius Where I find him were it At home upon my brother 's guard even there Against the hospitable canon would I Wash my fierce hand in 's heart Go you to th ' city Learn how ' tis held and what they are that must Be hostages for Rome Will not you go I am attended at the cypress grove I pray you- ' Tis south the city mills- bring me word thither How the world goes that to the pace of it I may spur on my journey I shall sir Exeunt The augurer tells me we shall have news tonight Good or bad Not according to the prayer of the people for they love not Marcius Nature teaches beasts to know their friends Pray you who does the wolf love The lamb Ay to devour him as the hungry plebeians would the noble Marcius He 's a lamb indeed that baes like a bear He 's a bear indeed that lives fike a lamb You two are old men tell me one thing that I shall ask you Well sir In what enormity is Marcius poor in that you two have not in abundance He 's poor in no one fault but stor'd with all Especially in pride And topping all others in boasting This is strange now Do you two know how you are censured here in the city- I mean of us o ' th ' right hand file Do you Why how are we censur'd Because you talk of pride now- will you not be angry Well well sir well Why ' tis no great matter for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience Give your dispositions the reins and be angry at your pleasures- at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so You blame Marcius for being proud We do it not alone sir I know you can do very little alone for your helps are many or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too infant like for doing much alone You talk of pride O that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks and make but an interior survey of your good selves O that you could What then sir Why then you should discover a brace of unmeriting proud violent testy magistrates alias fools- as any in Rome Menenius you are known well enough too I am known to be a humorous patrician and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying Tiber in't said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint hasty and tinder like upon too trivial motion one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning What I think I utter and spend my malice in my breath Meeting two such wealsmen as you are- I can not call you Lycurguses- if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely I make a crooked face at it I can not say your worships have deliver'd the matter well when I find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though I must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces If you see this in the map of my microcosm follows it that I am known well enough too What harm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character if I be known well enough too Come sir come we know you well enough You know neither me yourselves nor any thing You are ambitious for poor knaves ' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a fosset seller and then rejourn the controversy of threepence to a second day of audience When you are hearing a matter between party and party if you chance to be pinch'd with the colic you make faces like mummers set up the bloody flag against all patience and in roaring for a chamber pot dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing All the peace you make in their cause is calling both the parties knaves You are a pair of strange ones Come come you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the Capitol Our very priests must become mockers if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are When you speak best unto the purpose it is not worth the wagging of your beards and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher 's cushion or to be entomb'd in an ass 's pack saddle Yet you must be saying Marcius is proud who in a cheap estimation is worth all your predecessors since Deucalion though peradventure some of the best of 'em were hereditary hangmen God den to your worships More of your conversation would infect my brain being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians I will be bold to take my leave of you Honourable Menenius my boy Marcius approaches for the love of Juno let 's go Ha Marcius coming home Ay worthy Menenius and with most prosperous approbation Take my cap Jupiter and I thank thee Hoo Marcius coming home Look here 's a letter from him the state hath another his wife another and I think there 's one at home for you I will make my very house reel to night A letter for me Yes certain there 's a letter for you I saw't A letter for me It gives me an estate of seven years ' health in which time I will make a lip at the physician The most sovereign prescription in Galen is but empiricutic and to this preservative of no better report than a horse drench Is he not wounded He was wo nt to come home wounded O no no no O he is wounded I thank the gods for't So do I too if it be not too much Brings a victory in his pocket The wounds become him On 's brows Menenius he comes the third time home with the oaken garland Has he disciplin'd Aufidius soundly Titus Lartius writes they fought together but Aufidius got off And ' twas time for him too I 'll warrant him that an he had stay'd by him I would not have been so fidius'd for all the chests in Corioli and the gold that 's in them Is the Senate possess'd of this Good ladies let 's go Yes yes yes the Senate has letters from the general wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly In troth there 's wondrous things spoke of him Wondrous Ay I warrant you and not without his true purchasing The gods grant them true True pow waw True I 'll be sworn they are true Where is he wounded To the TRIBUNES God save your good worships Marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud Where is he wounded I ' th ' shoulder and i ' th ' left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people when he shall stand for his place He received in the repulse of Tarquin seven hurts i ' th ' body One i ' th ' neck and two i ' th ' thigh- there 's nine that I know He had before this last expedition twenty five wounds upon him Now it 's twenty seven every gash was an enemy 's grave A shout and flourish Hark the trumpets These are the ushers of Marcius Before him he carries Know Rome that all alone Marcius did fight Within Corioli gates where he hath won With fame a name to Caius Marcius these In honour follows Coriolanus Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus Flourish Welcome to Rome renowned Coriolanus No more of this it does offend my heart Pray now no more Look sir your mother O You have I know petition'd all the gods For my prosperity Kneels Nay my good soldier up My gentle Marcius worthy Caius and By deed achieving honour newly nam'd- What is it Coriolanus must I can thee But O thy wife My gracious silence hail Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home That weep'st to see me triumph Ah my dear Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear And mothers that lack sons Now the gods crown thee And live you yet To VALERIA O my sweet lady pardon I know not where to turn O welcome home And welcome General And y'are welcome all A hundred thousand welcomes I could weep And I could laugh I am light and heavy Welcome A curse begin at very root on 's heart That is not glad to see thee You are three That Rome should dote on yet by the faith of men We have some old crab trees here at home that will not Be grafted to your relish Yet welcome warriors We call a nettle but a nettle and The faults of fools but folly Ever right Menenius ever ever Give way there and go on To his wife and mother Your hand and yours Ere in our own house I do shade my head The good patricians must be visited From whom I have receiv'd not only greetings But with them change of honours I have lived To see inherited my very wishes And the buildings of my fancy only There 's one thing wanting which I doubt not but Our Rome will cast upon thee Know good mother I had rather be their servant in my way Than sway with them in theirs On to the Capitol All tongues speak of him and the bleared sights Are spectacled to see him Your prattling nurse Into a rapture lets her baby cry While she chats him the kitchen malkin pins Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck Clamb'ring the walls to eye him stalls bulks windows Are smother'd up leads fill'd and ridges hors'd With variable complexions all agreeing In earnestness to see him Seld shown flamens Do press among the popular throngs and puff To win a vulgar station our veil'd dames Commit the war of white and damask in Their nicely gawded cheeks to th ' wanton spoil Of Phoebus ' burning kisses Such a pother As if that whatsoever god who leads him Were slily crept into his human powers And gave him graceful posture On the sudden I warrant him consul Then our office may During his power go sleep He can not temp'rately transport his honours From where he should begin and end but will Lose those he hath won In that there 's comfort Doubt not The commoners for whom we stand but they Upon their ancient malice will forget With the least cause these his new honours which That he will give them make I as little question As he is proud to do't I heard him swear Were he to stand for consul never would he Appear i ' th ' market place nor on him put The napless vesture of humility Nor showing as the manner is his wounds To th ' people beg their stinking breaths ' Tis right It was his word O he would miss it rather Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him And the desire of the nobles I wish no better Than have him hold that purpose and to put it In execution ' Tis most like he will It shall be to him then as our good wills A sure destruction So it must fall out To him or our authorities For an end We must suggest the people in what hatred He still hath held them that to 's power he would Have made them mules silenc'd their pleaders and Dispropertied their freedoms holding them In human action and capacity Of no more soul nor fitness for the world Than camels in their war who have their provand Only for bearing burdens and sore blows For sinking under them This as you say suggested At some time when his soaring insolence Shall touch the people- which time shall not want If he be put upon't and that 's as easy As to set dogs on sheep- will be his fire To kindle their dry stubble and their blaze Shall darken him for ever What 's the matter You are sent for to the Capitol ' Tis thought That Marcius shall be consul I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and The blind to hear him speak matrons flung gloves Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers Upon him as he pass'd the nobles bended As to Jove 's statue and the commons made A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts I never saw the like Let 's to the Capitol And carry with us ears and eyes for th ' time But hearts for the event Have with you Exeunt Come come they are almost here How many stand for consulships Three they say but ' tis thought of every one Coriolanus will carry it That 's a brave fellow but he 's vengeance proud and loves not the common people Faith there have been many great men that have flatter'd the people who ne'er loved them and there be many that they have loved they know not wherefore so that if they love they know not why they hate upon no better a ground Therefore for Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly see't If he did not care whether he had their love or no he waved indifferently ' twixt doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than they can render it him and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite Now to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes- to flatter them for their love He hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who having been supple and courteous to the people bonneted without any further deed to have them at all into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes and his actions in their hearts that for their tongues to be silent and not confess so much were a kind of ingrateful injury to report otherwise were a malice that giving itself the lie would pluck reproof and rebuke from every car that heard it No more of him he 's a worthy man Make way they are coming Having determin'd of the Volsces and To send for Titus Lartius it remains As the main point of this our after meeting To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country Therefore please you Most reverend and grave elders to desire The present consul and last general In our well found successes to report A little of that worthy work perform'd By Caius Marcius Coriolanus whom We met here both to thank and to remember With honours like himself CORIOLANUS sits Speak good Cominius Leave nothing out for length and make us think Rather our state 's defective for requital Than we to stretch it out Masters o ' th ' people We do request your kindest ears and after Your loving motion toward the common body To yield what passes here We are convented Upon a pleasing treaty and have hearts Inclinable to honour and advance The theme of our assembly Which the rather We shall be bless'd to do if he remember A kinder value of the people than He hath hereto priz'd them at That 's off that 's off I would you rather had been silent Please you To hear Cominius speak Most willingly But yet my caution was more pertinent Than the rebuke you give it He loves your people But tie him not to be their bedfellow Worthy Cominius speak Sit Coriolanus never shame to hear What you have nobly done Your Honours ' pardon I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them Sir I hope My words disbench'd you not No sir yet oft When blows have made me stay I fled from words You sooth'd not therefore hurt not But your people I love them as they weigh- Pray now sit down I had rather have one scratch my head i ' th ' sun When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monster'd Exit Masters of the people Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter- That 's thousand to one good one- when you now see He had rather venture all his limbs for honour Than one on 's ears to hear it Proceed Cominius I shall lack voice the deeds of Coriolanus Should not be utter'd feebly It is held That valour is the chiefest virtue and Most dignifies the haver If it be The man I speak of can not in the world Be singly counterpois'd At sixteen years When Tarquin made a head for Rome he fought Beyond the mark of others our then Dictator Whom with all praise I point at saw him fight When with his Amazonian chin he drove The bristled lips before him he bestrid An o'erpress'd Roman and i ' th ' consul 's view Slew three opposers Tarquin 's self he met And struck him on his knee In that day 's feats When he might act the woman in the scene He prov'd best man i ' th ' field and for his meed Was brow bound with the oak His pupil age Man ent'red thus he waxed like a sea And in the brunt of seventeen battles since He lurch'd all swords of the garland For this last Before and in Corioli let me say I can not speak him home He stopp'd the fliers And by his rare example made the coward Turn terror into sport as weeds before A vessel under sail so men obey'd And fell below his stem His sword death 's stamp Where it did mark it took from face to foot He was a thing of blood whose every motion Was tim'd with dying cries Alone he ent'red The mortal gate of th ' city which he painted With shunless destiny aidless came off And with a sudden re enforcement struck Corioli like a planet Now all 's his When by and by the din of war ' gan pierce His ready sense then straight his doubled spirit Re quick'ned what in flesh was fatigate And to the battle came he where he did Run reeking o'er the lives of men as if ' Twere a perpetual spoil and till we call'd Both field and city ours he never stood To ease his breast with panting Worthy man He can not but with measure fit the honours Which we devise him Our spoils he kick'd at And look'd upon things precious as they were The common muck of the world He covets less Than misery itself would give rewards His deeds with doing them and is content To spend the time to end it He 's right noble Let him be call'd for Call Coriolanus OFFICER He doth appear The Senate Coriolanus are well pleas'd To make thee consul I do owe them still My life and services It then remains That you do speak to the people I do beseech you Let me o'erleap that custom for I can not Put on the gown stand naked and entreat them For my wounds ' sake to give their suffrage Please you That I may pass this doing Sir the people Must have their voices neither will they bate One jot of ceremony Put them not to't Pray you go fit you to the custom and Take to you as your predecessors have Your honour with your form It is a part That I shall blush in acting and might well Be taken from the people Mark you that To brag unto them ' Thus I did and thus ' Show them th ' unaching scars which I should hide As if I had receiv'd them for the hire Of their breath only Do not stand upon't We recommend to you Tribunes of the People Our purpose to them and to our noble consul Wish we all joy and honour To Coriolanus come all joy and honour You see how he intends to use the people May they perceive 's intent He will require them As if he did contemn what he requested Should be in them to give Come we 'll inform them Of our proceedings here On th ' market place I know they do attend us Exeunt Once if he do require our voices we ought not to deny him We may sir if we will We have power in ourselves to do it but it is a power that we have no power to do for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them so if he tell us his noble deeds we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them Ingratitude is monstrous and for the multitude to be ingrateful were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members should bring ourselves to be monstrous members And to make us no better thought of a little help will serve for once we stood up about the corn he himself stuck not to call us the many headed multitude We have been call'd so of many not that our heads are some brown some black some abram some bald but that our wits are so diversely colour'd and truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull they would fly east west north south and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o ' th ' compass Think you so Which way do you judge my wit would fly Nay your wit will not so soon out as another man 's will- ' tis strongly wedg'd up in a block head but if it were at liberty ' twould sure southward Why that way To lose itself in a fog where being three parts YOU are never without your tricks you may you may Are you all resolv'd to give your voices But that 's no matter the greater part carries it I say if he would incline to the people there was never a worthier man Content content Exeunt citizens O sir you are not right have you not known The worthiest men have done't What must I say ' I pray sir'- Plague upon't I can not bring My tongue to such a pace ' Look sir my wounds I got them in my country 's service when Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran From th ' noise of our own drums ' O me the gods You must not speak of that You must desire them To think upon you Think upon me Hang 'em I would they would forget me like the virtues Which our divines lose by 'em You 'll mar all I 'll leave you Pray you speak to 'em I pray you In wholesome manner Exit Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean So here comes a brace You know the cause sir of my standing here We do sir tell us what hath brought you to't Mine own desert Your own desert Ay not mine own desire How not your own desire No sir ' twas never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging YOU MUST think if we give you anything we hope to gain by you Well then I pray your price o ' th ' consulship The price is to ask it kindly Kindly sir I pray let me ha't I have wounds to show you which shall be yours in private Your good voice sir what say you You shall ha ' it worthy sir A match sir There 's in all two worthy voices begg'd I have your alms Adieu But this is something odd An ' twere to give again- but ' tis no matter Pray you now if it may stand with the tune of your voices that I may be consul I have here the customary gown You have deserved nobly of your country and you have not deserved nobly Your enigma You have been a scourge to her enemies you have been a rod to her friends You have not indeed loved the common people You should account me the more virtuous that I have not been common in my love I will sir flatter my sworn brother the people to earn a dearer estimation of them ' tis a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart I will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly That is sir I will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers Therefore beseech you I may be consul We hope to find you our friend and therefore give you our voices heartily You have received many wounds for your country I will not seal your knowledge with showing them I will make much of your voices and so trouble you no farther The gods give you joy sir heartily Most sweet voices Better it is to die better to starve Than crave the hire which first we do deserve Why in this wolvish toge should I stand here To beg of Hob and Dick that do appear Their needless vouches Custom calls me to't What custom wills in all things should we do't The dust on antique time would lie unswept And mountainous error be too highly heap'd For truth to o'erpeer Rather than fool it so Let the high office and the honour go To one that would do thus I am half through The one part suffered the other will I do He has done nobly and can not go without any honest man 's voice Therefore let him be consul The gods give him joy and make him good friend to the people Amen amen God save thee noble consul Worthy voices You have stood your limitation and the tribunes Endue you with the people 's voice Remains That in th ' official marks invested you Anon do meet the Senate Is this done The custom of request you have discharg'd The people do admit you and are summon'd To meet anon upon your approbation Where At the Senate House There Coriolanus May I change these garments You may sir That I 'll straight do and knowing myself again Repair to th ' Senate House I 'll keep you company Will you along We stay here for the people Fare you well With a proud heart he wore His humble weeds Will you dismiss the people How now my masters Have you chose this man He has our voices sir We pray the gods he may deserve your loves Amen sir To my poor unworthy notice He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices Certainly He flouted us downright No ' tis his kind of speech- he did not mock us Not one amongst us save yourself but says He us'd us scornfully He should have show'd us His marks of merit wounds receiv'd for 's country Why so he did I am sure No no no man saw 'em He said he had wounds which he could show in Why either were you ignorant to see't Or seeing it of such childish friendliness To yield your voices Could you not have told him- As you were lesson'd- when he had no power But was a petty servant to the state He was your enemy ever spake against Your liberties and the charters that you bear I ' th ' body of the weal and now arriving A place of potency and sway o ' th ' state If he should still malignantly remain Fast foe to th ' plebeii your voices might Be curses to yourselves You should have said That as his worthy deeds did claim no less Than what he stood for so his gracious nature Would think upon you for your voices and Translate his malice towards you into love Standing your friendly lord Thus to have said As you were fore advis'd had touch'd his spirit And tried his inclination from him pluck'd Either his gracious promise which you might As cause had call'd you up have held him to Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature Which easily endures not article Tying him to aught So putting him to rage You should have ta'en th ' advantage of his choler And pass'd him unelected Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves and do you think That his contempt shall not be bruising to you When he hath power to crush Why had your bodies No heart among you Or had you tongues to cry Against the rectorship of judgment Have you Ere now denied the asker and now again Of him that did not ask but mock bestow Your su'd for tongues He 's not confirm'd we may deny him yet And will deny him I 'll have five hundred voices of that sound I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em Get you hence instantly and tell those friends They have chose a consul that will from them take Their liberties make them of no more voice Than dogs that are as often beat for barking As therefore kept to do so Let them assemble And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election Enforce his pride And his old hate unto you besides forget not With what contempt he wore the humble weed How in his suit he scorn'd you but your loves Thinking upon his services took from you Th ' apprehension of his present portance Which most gibingly ungravely he did fashion After the inveterate hate he bears you Lay A fault on us your tribunes that we labour'd No impediment between but that you must Cast your election on him Say you chose him More after our commandment than as guided By your own true affections and that your minds Pre occupied with what you rather must do Than what you should made you against the grain To voice him consul Lay the fault on us Ay spare us not Say we read lectures to you How youngly he began to serve his country How long continued and what stock he springs of- The noble house o ' th ' Marcians from whence came That Ancus Marcius Numa 's daughter 's son Who after great Hostilius here was king Of the same house Publius and Quintus were That our best water brought by conduits hither And Censorinus nobly named so Twice being by the people chosen censor Was his great ancestor One thus descended That hath beside well in his person wrought To be set high in place we did commend To your remembrances but you have found Scaling his present bearing with his past That he 's your fixed enemy and revoke Your sudden approbation Say you ne'er had done't- Harp on that still- but by our putting on And presently when you have drawn your number Repair to th ' Capitol will will so almost all Repent in their election Exeunt plebeians Let them go on This mutiny were better put in hazard Than stay past doubt for greater If as his nature is he fall in rage With their refusal both observe and answer The vantage of his anger To th ' Capitol come We will be there before the stream o ' th ' people And this shall seem as partly ' tis their own Which we have goaded onward Exeunt Tullus Aufidius then had made new head He had my lord and that it was which caus'd Our swifter composition So then the Volsces stand but as at first Ready when time shall prompt them to make road Upon 's again They are worn Lord Consul so That we shall hardly in our ages see Their banners wave again Saw you Aufidius On safeguard he came to me and did curse Against the Volsces for they had so vilely Yielded the town He is retir'd to Antium Spoke he of me He did my lord How What How often he had met you sword to sword That of all things upon the earth he hated Your person most that he would pawn his fortunes To hopeless restitution so he might Be call'd your vanquisher At Antium lives he At Antium I wish I had a cause to seek him there To oppose his hatred fully Welcome home Pass no further Ha What is that It will be dangerous to go on- no further What makes this change The matter Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common Cominius no Have I had children 's voices Tribunes give way he shall to th ' market place The people are incens'd against him Stop Or all will fall in broil Are these your herd Must these have voices that can yield them now And straight disclaim their tongues What are your offices You being their mouths why rule you not their teeth Have you not set them on Be calm be calm It is a purpos'd thing and grows by plot To curb the will of the nobility Suffer't and live with such as can not rule Nor ever will be rul'd Call't not a plot The people cry you mock'd them and of late When corn was given them gratis you repin'd Scandal'd the suppliants for the people call'd them Time pleasers flatterers foes to nobleness Why this was known before Not to them all Have you inform'd them sithence How I inform them You are like to do such business Not unlike Each way to better yours Why then should I be consul By yond clouds Let me deserve so ill as you and make me Your fellow tribune You show too much of that For which the people stir if you will pass To where you are bound you must enquire your way Which you are out of with a gentler spirit Or never be so noble as a consul Nor yoke with him for tribune Let 's be calm The people are abus'd set on This palt'ring Becomes not Rome nor has Coriolanus Deserved this so dishonour'd rub laid falsely I ' th ' plain way of his merit Tell me of corn This was my speech and I will speak't again- Not now not now Not in this heat sir now Now as I live I will My nobler friends I crave their pardons For the mutable rank scented meiny let them Regard me as I do not flatter and Therein behold themselves I say again In soothing them we nourish ' gainst our Senate The cockle of rebellion insolence sedition Which we ourselves have plough'd for sow'd and scatter'd By mingling them with us the honour'd number Who lack not virtue no nor power but that Which they have given to beggars Well no more No more words we beseech you How no more As for my country I have shed my blood Not fearing outward force so shall my lungs Coin words till their decay against those measles Which we disdain should tetter us yet sought The very way to catch them You speak o ' th ' people As if you were a god to punish not A man of their infirmity ' Twere well We let the people know't What what his choler Choler Were I as patient as the midnight sleep By Jove ' twould be my mind It is a mind That shall remain a poison where it is Not poison any further Shall remain Hear you this Triton of the minnows Mark you His absolute ' shall ' ' Twas from the canon ' Shall ' O good but most unwise patricians Why You grave but reckless senators have you thus Given Hydra here to choose an officer That with his peremptory ' shall ' being but The horn and noise o ' th ' monster 's wants not spirit To say he 'll turn your current in a ditch And make your channel his If he have power Then vail your ignorance if none awake Your dangerous lenity If you are learn'd Be not as common fools if you are not Let them have cushions by you You are plebeians If they be senators and they are no less When both your voices blended the great'st taste Most palates theirs They choose their magistrate And such a one as he who puts his ' shall ' His popular ' shall ' against a graver bench Than ever frown'd in Greece By Jove himself It makes the consuls base and my soul aches To know when two authorities are up Neither supreme how soon confusion May enter ' twixt the gap of both and take The one by th ' other Well on to th ' market place Whoever gave that counsel to give forth The corn o ' th ' storehouse gratis as ' twas us'd Sometime in Greece- Well well no more of that Though there the people had more absolute pow'r- I say they nourish'd disobedience fed The ruin of the state Why shall the people give One that speaks thus their voice I 'll give my reasons More worthier than their voices They know the corn Was not our recompense resting well assur'd They ne'er did service for't being press'd to th ' war Even when the navel of the state was touch'd They would not thread the gates This kind of service Did not deserve corn gratis Being i ' th ' war Their mutinies and revolts wherein they show'd Most valour spoke not for them Th ' accusation Which they have often made against the Senate All cause unborn could never be the native Of our so frank donation Well what then How shall this bosom multiplied digest The Senate 's courtesy Let deeds express What 's like to be their words ' We did request it We are the greater poll and in true fear They gave us our demands ' Thus we debase The nature of our seats and make the rabble Call our cares fears which will in time Break ope the locks o ' th ' Senate and bring in The crows to peck the eagles Come enough Enough with over measure No take more What may be sworn by both divine and human Seal what I end withal This double worship Where one part does disdain with cause the other Insult without all reason where gentry title wisdom Can not conclude but by the yea and no Of general ignorance- it must omit Real necessities and give way the while To unstable slightness Purpose so barr'd it follows Nothing is done to purpose Therefore beseech you- You that will be less fearful than discreet That love the fundamental part of state More than you doubt the change on't that prefer A noble life before a long and wish To jump a body with a dangerous physic That 's sure of death without it- at once pluck out The multitudinous tongue let them not lick The sweet which is their poison Your dishonour Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state Of that integrity which should become't Not having the power to do the good it would For th ' ill which doth control't Has said enough Has spoken like a traitor and shall answer As traitors do Thou wretch despite o'erwhelm thee What should the people do with these bald tribunes On whom depending their obedience fails To the greater bench In a rebellion When what 's not meet but what must be was law Then were they chosen in a better hour Let what is meet be said it must be meet And throw their power i ' th ' dust Manifest treason This a consul No The aediles ho Go call the people Exit AEDILE in whose name myself Attach thee as a traitorous innovator A foe to th ' public weal Obey I charge thee And follow to thine answer Hence old goat We 'll surety him Ag'd sir hands off Hence rotten thing or I shall shake thy bones Out of thy garments Help ye citizens On both sides more respect Here 's he that would take from you all your power Seize him aediles PLEBEIANS Down with him down with him Weapons weapons

To th ' people- Coriolanus patience Speak good Sicinius Hear me people peace Let 's hear our tribune Peace Speak speak speak You are at point to lose your liberties Marcius would have all from you Marcius Whom late you have nam'd for consul Fie fie fie This is the way to kindle not to quench To unbuild the city and to lay all flat What is the city but the people True The people are the city By the consent of all we were establish'd The people 's magistrates You so remain And so are like to do That is the way to lay the city flat To bring the roof to the foundation And bury all which yet distinctly ranges In heaps and piles of ruin This deserves death Or let us stand to our authority Or let us lose it We do here pronounce Upon the part o ' th ' people in whose power We were elected theirs Marcius is worthy Of present death Therefore lay hold of him Bear him to th ' rock Tarpeian and from thence Into destruction cast him AEdiles seize him Yield Marcius yield Hear me one word beseech you Tribunes Hear me but a word Peace peace Be that you seem truly your country 's friend And temp'rately proceed to what you would Thus violently redress Sir those cold ways That seem like prudent helps are very poisonous Where the disease is violent Lay hands upon him And bear him to the rock No I 'll die here There 's some among you have beheld me fighting Come try upon yourselves what you have seen me Down with that sword Tribunes withdraw awhile Lay hands upon him Help Marcius help You that be noble help him young and old Down with him down with him Go get you to your house be gone away All will be nought else Get you gone Stand fast We have as many friends as enemies Shall it be put to that The gods forbid I prithee noble friend home to thy house Leave us to cure this cause For ' tis a sore upon us You can not tent yourself be gone beseech you Come sir along with us I would they were barbarians as they are Though in Rome litter'd not Romans as they are not Though calved i ' th ' porch o ' th ' Capitol Be gone Put not your worthy rage into your tongue One time will owe another On fair ground I could beat forty of them I could myself Take up a brace o ' th ' best of them yea the two tribunes But now ' tis odds beyond arithmetic And manhood is call'd foolery when it stands Against a falling fabric Will you hence Before the tag return whose rage doth rend Like interrupted waters and o'erbear What they are us'd to bear Pray you be gone I 'll try whether my old wit be in request With those that have but little this must be patch'd With cloth of any colour Nay come away This man has marr'd his fortune His nature is too noble for the world He would not flatter Neptune for his trident Or Jove for 's power to thunder His heart 's his mouth What his breast forges that his tongue must vent And being angry does forget that ever He heard the name of death A noise within Here 's goodly work I would they were a bed I would they were in Tiber What the vengeance could he not speak 'em fair Where is this viper That would depopulate the city and Be every man himself You worthy Tribunes- He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock With rigorous hands he hath resisted law And therefore law shall scorn him further trial Than the severity of the public power Which he so sets at nought He shall well know The noble tribunes are the people 's mouths And we their hands He shall sure on't Sir sir- Peace Do not cry havoc where you should but hunt With modest warrant Sir how comes't that you Have holp to make this rescue Hear me speak As I do know the consul 's worthiness So can I name his faults Consul What consul The consul Coriolanus He consul No no no no no If by the tribunes ' leave and yours good people I may be heard I would crave a word or two The which shall turn you to no further harm Than so much loss of time Speak briefly then For we are peremptory to dispatch This viperous traitor to eject him hence Were but one danger and to keep him here Our certain death therefore it is decreed He dies to night Now the good gods forbid That our renowned Rome whose gratitude Towards her deserved children is enroll'd In Jove 's own book like an unnatural dam Should now eat up her own He 's a disease that must be cut away O he 's a limb that has but a disease- Mortal to cut it off to cure it easy What has he done to Rome that 's worthy death Killing our enemies the blood he hath lost- Which I dare vouch is more than that he hath By many an ounce- he dropt it for his country And what is left to lose it by his country Were to us all that do't and suffer it A brand to th ' end o ' th ' world This is clean kam Merely awry When he did love his country It honour'd him The service of the foot Being once gangren'd is not then respected For what before it was We 'll hear no more Pursue him to his house and pluck him thence Lest his infection being of catching nature Spread further One word more one word This tiger footed rage when it shall find The harm of unscann'd swiftness will too late Tie leaden pounds to 's heels Proceed by process Lest parties- as he is belov'd- break out And sack great Rome with Romans If it were so- What do ye talk Have we not had a taste of his obedience- Our aediles smote ourselves resisted Come Consider this he has been bred i ' th ' wars Since ' a could draw a sword and is ill school'd In bolted language meal and bran together He throws without distinction Give me leave I 'll go to him and undertake to bring him Where he shall answer by a lawful form In peace to his utmost peril Noble Tribunes It is the humane way the other course Will prove too bloody and the end of it Unknown to the beginning Noble Menenius Be you then as the people 's officer Masters lay down your weapons Go not home Meet on the market place We 'll attend you there Where if you bring not Marcius we 'll proceed In our first way I 'll bring him to you To the SENATORS Let me desire your company he must come Or what is worst will follow Pray you let 's to him Exeunt Let them pull all about mine ears present me Death on the wheel or at wild horses ' heels Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock That the precipitation might down stretch Below the beam of sight yet will I still Be thus to them You do the nobler I muse my mother Does not approve me further who was wo nt To call them woollen vassals things created To buy and sell with groats to show bare heads In congregations to yawn be still and wonder When one but of my ordinance stood up To speak of peace or war O sir sir sir I would have had you put your power well on Before you had worn it out Let go You might have been enough the man you are With striving less to be so lesser had been The thwartings of your dispositions if You had not show'd them how ye were dispos'd Ere they lack'd power to cross you Let them hang Ay and burn too Come come you have been too rough something too rough You must return and mend it There 's no remedy Unless by not so doing our good city Cleave in the midst and perish Pray be counsell'd I have a heart as little apt as yours But yet a brain that leads my use of anger To better vantage Well said noble woman Before he should thus stoop to th ' herd but that The violent fit o ' th ' time craves it as physic For the whole state I would put mine armour on Which I can scarcely bear What must I do Return to th ' tribunes Well what then what then Repent what you have spoke For them I can not do it to the gods Must I then do't to them You are too absolute Though therein you can never be too noble But when extremities speak I have heard you say Honour and policy like unsever'd friends I ' th ' war do grow together grant that and tell me In peace what each of them by th ' other lose That they combine not there Tush tush A good demand If it be honour in your wars to seem The same you are not which for your best ends You adopt your policy how is it less or worse That it shall hold companionship in peace With honour as in war since that to both It stands in like request Why force you this Because that now it lies you on to speak To th ' people not by your own instruction Nor by th ' matter which your heart prompts you But with such words that are but roted in Your tongue though but bastards and syllables Of no allowance to your bosom 's truth Now this no more dishonours you at all Than to take in a town with gentle words Which else would put you to your fortune and The hazard of much blood I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake requir'd I should do so in honour I am in this Your wife your son these senators the nobles And you will rather show our general louts How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard Of what that want might ruin Noble lady Come go with us speak fair you may salve so Not what is dangerous present but the los Of what is past I prithee now My son Go to them with this bonnet in thy hand And thus far having stretch'd it- here be with them- Thy knee bussing the stones- for in such busines Action is eloquence and the eyes of th ' ignorant More learned than the ears- waving thy head Which often thus correcting thy stout heart Now humble as the ripest mulberry That will not hold the handling Or say to them Thou art their soldier and being bred in broils Hast not the soft way which thou dost confess Were fit for thee to use as they to claim In asking their good loves but thou wilt frame Thyself forsooth hereafter theirs so far As thou hast power and person This but done Even as she speaks why their hearts were yours For they have pardons being ask'd as free As words to little purpose Prithee now Go and be rul'd although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower I have been i ' th ' market place and sir ' tis fit You make strong party or defend yourself By calmness or by absence all 's in anger Only fair speech I think ' twill serve if he Can thereto frame his spirit He must and will Prithee now say you will and go about it Must I go show them my unbarb'd sconce Must I With my base tongue give to my noble heart A lie that it must bear Well I will do't Yet were there but this single plot to lose This mould of Marcius they to dust should grind it And throw't against the wind To th ' market place You have put me now to such a part which never I shall discharge to th ' life Come come we 'll prompt you I prithee now sweet son as thou hast said My praises made thee first a soldier so To have my praise for this perform a part Thou hast not done before Well I must do't Away my disposition and possess me Some harlot 's spirit My throat of war be turn'd Which quier'd with my drum into a pipe Small as an eunuch or the virgin voice That babies lulls asleep The smiles of knaves Tent in my cheeks and schoolboys ' tears take up The glasses of my sight A beggar 's tongue Make motion through my lips and my arm'd knees Who bow'd but in my stirrup bend like his That hath receiv'd an alms I will not do't Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth And by my body 's action teach my mind A most inherent baseness At thy choice then To beg of thee it is my more dishonour Than thou of them Come all to ruin Let Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear Thy dangerous stoutness for I mock at death With as big heart as thou Do as thou list Thy valiantness was mine thou suck'dst it from me But owe thy pride thyself Pray be content Mother I am going to the market place Chide me no more I 'll mountebank their loves Cog their hearts from them and come home belov'd Of all the trades in Rome Look I am going Commend me to my wife I 'll return consul Or never trust to what my tongue can do I ' th ' way of flattery further Do your will Exit Away The tribunes do attend you Arm yourself To answer mildly for they are prepar'd With accusations as I hear more strong Than are upon you yet The word is ' mildly ' Pray you let us go Let them accuse me by invention I Will answer in mine honour Ay but mildly Well mildly be it then- mildly Exeunt In this point charge him home that he affects Tyrannical power If he evade us there Enforce him with his envy to the people And that the spoil got on the Antiates Was ne'er distributed He 's coming How accompanied With old Menenius and those senators That always favour'd him Have you a catalogue Of all the voices that we have procur'd Set down by th ' poll I have ' tis ready Have you corrected them by tribes I have Assemble presently the people hither And when they hear me say ' It shall be so I ' th ' right and strength o ' th ' commons ' be it either For death for fine or banishment then let them If I say fine cry ' Fine!'- if death cry ' Death ' Insisting on the old prerogative And power i ' th ' truth o ' th ' cause I shall inform them And when such time they have begun to cry Let them not cease but with a din confus'd Enforce the present execution Of what we chance to sentence Very well Make them be strong and ready for this hint When we shall hap to give't them Go about it Exit AEDILE Put him to choler straight He hath been us'd Ever to conquer and to have his worth Of contradiction being once chaf'd he can not Be rein'd again to temperance then he speaks What 's in his heart and that is there which looks With us to break his neck Well here he comes Calmly I do beseech you Ay as an ostler that for th ' poorest piece Will bear the knave by th ' volume Th ' honour'd gods Keep Rome in safety and the chairs of justice Supplied with worthy men plant love among 's Throng our large temples with the shows of peace And not our streets with war Amen amen A noble wish Draw near ye people List to your tribunes Audience peace I say First hear me speak Well say Peace ho Shall I be charg'd no further than this present Must all determine here I do demand If you submit you to the people 's voices Allow their officers and are content To suffer lawful censure for such faults As shall be prov'd upon you I am content Lo citizens he says he is content The warlike service he has done consider think Upon the wounds his body bears which show Like graves i ' th ' holy churchyard Scratches with briers Scars to move laughter only Consider further That when he speaks not like a citizen You find him like a soldier do not take His rougher accents for malicious sounds But as I say such as become a soldier Rather than envy you Well well No more What is the matter That being pass'd for consul with full voice I am so dishonour'd that the very hour You take it off again Answer to us Say then ' tis true I ought so We charge you that you have contriv'd to take From Rome all season'd office and to wind Yourself into a power tyrannical For which you are a traitor to the people How- traitor Nay temperately Your promise The fires i ' th ' lowest hell fold in the people Call me their traitor Thou injurious tribune Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths In thy hands clutch'd as many millions in Thy lying tongue both numbers I would say ' Thou liest ' unto thee with a voice as free As I do pray the gods Mark you this people To th ' rock to th ' rock with him Peace We need not put new matter to his charge What you have seen him do and heard him speak Beating your officers cursing yourselves Opposing laws with strokes and here defying Those whose great power must try him- even this So criminal and in such capital kind Deserves th ' extremest death But since he hath Serv'd well for Rome- What do you prate of service I talk of that that know it You Is this the promise that you made your mother Know I pray you- I 'll know no further Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death Vagabond exile flaying pent to linger But with a grain a day I would not buy Their mercy at the price of one fair word Nor check my courage for what they can give To have't with saying ' Good morrow ' For that he has- As much as in him lies- from time to time Envied against the people seeking means To pluck away their power as now at last Given hostile strokes and that not in the presence Of dreaded justice but on the ministers That do distribute it- in the name o ' th ' people And in the power of us the tribunes we Ev'n from this instant banish him our city In peril of precipitation From off the rock Tarpeian never more To enter our Rome gates I ' th ' people 's name I say it shall be so It shall be so it shall be so Let him away He 's banish'd and it shall be so Hear me my masters and my common friends- He 's sentenc'd no more hearing Let me speak I have been consul and can show for Rome Her enemies ' marks upon me I do love My country 's good with a respect more tender More holy and profound than mine own life My dear wife 's estimate her womb 's increase And treasure of my loins Then if I would Speak that- We know your drift Speak what There 's no more to be said but he is banish'd As enemy to the people and his country It shall be so It shall be so it shall be so YOU common cry of curs whose breath I hate As reek o ' th ' rotten fens whose loves I prize As the dead carcasses of unburied men That do corrupt my air- I banish you And here remain with your uncertainty Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts Your enemies with nodding of their plumes Fan you into despair Have the power still To banish your defenders till at length Your ignorance- which finds not till it feels Making but reservation of yourselves Still your own foes- deliver you As most abated

master How sir Do you meddle with my master Ay ' tis an honester service than to meddle with thy mistress Thou prat'st and prat'st serve with thy trencher hence Beats him away Where is this fellow Here sir I 'd have beaten him like a dog but for disturbing the lords within Whence com'st thou What wouldst thou Thy name Why speak'st not Speak man What 's thy name Unmuffling If Tullus Not yet thou know'st me and seeing me dost not Think me for the man I am necessity Commands me name myself What is thy name A name unmusical to the Volscians ' ears And harsh in sound to thine Say what 's thy name Thou has a grim appearance and thy face Bears a command in't though thy tackle 's torn Thou show'st a noble vessel What 's thy name Prepare thy brow to frown- know'st thou me yet I know thee not Thy name My name is Caius Marcius who hath done To thee particularly and to all the Volsces Great hurt and mischief thereto witness may My surname Coriolanus The painful service The extreme dangers and the drops of blood Shed for my thankless country are requited But with that surname- a good memory And witness of the malice and displeasure Which thou shouldst bear me Only that name remains The cruelty and envy of the people Permitted by our dastard nobles who Have all forsook me hath devour'd the rest An suffer'd me by th ' voice of slaves to be Whoop'd out of Rome Now this extremity Hath brought me to thy hearth not out of hope Mistake me not to save my life for if I had fear'd death of all the men i ' th ' world I would have ' voided thee but in mere spite To be full quit of those my banishers Stand I before thee here Then if thou hast A heart of wreak in thee that wilt revenge Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims Of shame seen through thy country speed thee straight And make my misery serve thy turn So use it That my revengeful services may prove As benefits to thee for I will fight Against my cank'red country with the spleen Of all the under fiends But if so be Thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes Th'art tir'd then in a word I also am Longer to live most weary and present My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice Which not to cut would show thee but a fool Since I have ever followed thee with hate Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country 's breast And can not live but to thy shame unless It be to do thee service O Marcius Marcius Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart A root of ancient envy If Jupiter Should from yond cloud speak divine things And say '' Tis true ' I 'd not believe them more Than thee all noble Marcius Let me twine Mine arms about that body where against My grained ash an hundred times hath broke And scarr'd the moon with splinters here I clip The anvil of my sword and do contest As hotly and as nobly with thy love As ever in ambitious strength I did Contend against thy valour Know thou first I lov'd the maid I married never man Sigh'd truer breath but that I see thee here Thou noble thing more dances my rapt heart Than when I first my wedded mistress saw Bestride my threshold Why thou Mars I tell the We have a power on foot and I had purpose Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn Or lose mine arm for't Thou hast beat me out Twelve several times and I have nightly since Dreamt of encounters ' twixt thyself and me- We have been down together in my sleep Unbuckling helms fisting each other 's throat- And wak'd half dead with nothing Worthy Marcius Had we no other quarrel else to Rome but that Thou art thence banish'd we would muster all From twelve to seventy and pouring war Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome Like a bold flood o'erbeat O come go in And take our friendly senators by th ' hands Who now are here taking their leaves of me Who am prepar'd against your territories Though not for Rome itself You bless me gods Therefore most absolute sir if thou wilt have The leading of thine own revenges take Th ' one half of my commission and set down- As best thou art experienc'd since thou know'st Thy country 's strength and weakness- thine own ways Whether to knock against the gates of Rome Or rudely visit them in parts remote To fright them ere destroy But come in Let me commend thee first to those that shall Say yea to thy desires A thousand welcomes And more a friend than e'er an enemy Yet Marcius that was much Your hand most welcome Here 's a strange alteration By my hand I had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him What an arm he has He turn'd me about with his finger and his thumb as one would set up a top Nay I knew by his face that there was something in him he had sir a kind of face methought- I can not tell how to term it He had so looking as it were- Would I were hang'd but I thought there was more in him than I could think So did I I 'll be sworn He is simply the rarest man i ' th ' world I think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on Who my master Nay it 's no matter for that Worth six on him Nay not so neither but I take him to be the greater soldier Faith look you one can not tell how to say that for the defence of a town our general is excellent Ay and for an assault too O slaves I can tell you news- news you rascals What what what Let 's partake I would not be a Roman of all nations I had as lief be a condemn'd man Wherefore wherefore Why here 's he that was wo nt to thwack our general- Caius Marcius Why do you say ' thwack our general ' I do not say ' thwack our general ' but he was always good enough for him Come we are fellows and friends He was ever too hard for him I have heard him say so himself He was too hard for him directly to say the troth on't before Corioli he scotch'd him and notch'd him like a carbonado An he had been cannibally given he might have broil'd and eaten him too But more of thy news Why he is so made on here within as if he were son and heir to Mars set at upper end o ' th ' table no question asked him by any of the senators but they stand bald before him Our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with 's hand and turns up the white o ' th ' eye to his discourse But the bottom of the news is our general is cut i ' th ' middle and but one half of what he was yesterday for the other has half by the entreaty and grant of the whole table He 'll go he says and sowl the porter of Rome gates by th ' ears he will mow all down before him and leave his passage poll'd And he 's as like to do't as any man I can imagine Do't He will do't for look you sir he has as many friends as enemies which friends sir as it were durst not- look you sir- show themselves as we term it his friends whilst he 's in directitude Directitude What 's that But when they shall see sir his crest up again and the man in blood they will out of their burrows like conies after rain and revel an with him But when goes this forward To morrow to day presently You shall have the drum struck up this afternoon ' tis as it were parcel of their feast and to be executed ere they wipe their lips Why then we shall have a stirring world again This peace is nothing but to rust iron increase tailors and breed ballad makers Let me have war say I it exceeds peace as far as day does night it 's spritely waking audible and full of vent Peace is a very apoplexy lethargy mull'd deaf sleepy insensible a getter of more bastard children than war 's a destroyer of men ' Tis so and as war in some sort may be said to be a ravisher so it can not be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds Ay and it makes men hate one another Reason because they then less need one another The wars for my money I hope to see Romans as cheap as Volscians They are rising they are rising In in in in Exeunt We hear not of him neither need we fear him His remedies are tame The present peace And quietness of the people which before Were in wild hurry here do make his friends Blush that the world goes well who rather had Though they themselves did suffer by't behold Dissentious numbers pest'ring streets than see Our tradesmen singing in their shops and going About their functions friendly We stood to't in good time Is this Menenius ' Tis he ' tis he O he is grown most kind Of late Hail sir Hail to you both Your Coriolanus is not much miss'd But with his friends The commonwealth doth stand And so would do were he more angry at it All 's well and might have been much better He could have temporiz'd Where is he hear you Nay I hear nothing his mother and his wife Hear nothing from him The gods preserve you both God den our neighbours God den to you all god den to you an Ourselves our wives and children on our knees Are bound to pray for you both Live and thrive Farewell kind neighbours we wish'd Coriolanus Had lov'd you as we did Now the gods keep you Farewell farewell Exeunt citizens This is a happier and more comely time Than when these fellows ran about the streets Crying confusion Caius Marcius was A worthy officer i ' the war but insolent O'ercome with pride ambitious past all thinking Self loving- And affecting one sole throne Without assistance I think not so We should by this to all our lamentation If he had gone forth consul found it so The gods have well prevented it and Rome Sits safe and still without him Worthy tribunes There is a slave whom we have put in prison Reports the Volsces with several powers Are ent'red in the Roman territories And with the deepest malice of the war Destroy what lies before 'em ' Tis Aufidius Who hearing of our Marcius ' banishment Thrusts forth his horns again into the world Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome And durst not once peep out Come what talk you of Marcius Go see this rumourer whipp'd It can not be The Volsces dare break with us Can not be We have record that very well it can And three examples of the like hath been Within my age But reason with the fellow Before you punish him where he heard this Lest you shall chance to whip your information And beat the messenger who bids beware Of what is to be dreaded Tell not me I know this can not be Not Possible The nobles in great earnestness are going All to the Senate House some news is come That turns their countenances ' Tis this slave- Go whip him fore the people 's eyes- his raising Nothing but his report Yes worthy sir The slave 's report is seconded and more More fearful is deliver'd What more fearful It is spoke freely out of many mouths- How probable I do not know- that Marcius Join'd with Aufidius leads a power ' gainst Rome And vows revenge as spacious as between The young'st and oldest thing This is most likely Rais'd only that the weaker sort may wish Good Marcius home again The very trick on ' t. This is unlikely He and Aufidius can no more atone Than violent'st contrariety You are sent for to the Senate A fearful army led by Caius Marcius Associated with Aufidius rages Upon our territories and have already O'erborne their way consum'd with fire and took What lay before them O you have made good work What news what news You have holp to ravish your own daughters and To melt the city leads upon your pates To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses- What 's the news What 's the news Your temples burned in their cement and Your franchises whereon you stood confin'd Into an auger 's bore Pray now your news You have made fair work I fear me Pray your news If Marcius should be join'd wi ' th ' Volscians- If He is their god he leads them like a thing Made by some other deity than Nature That shapes man better and they follow him Against us brats with no less confidence Than boys pursuing summer butterflies Or butchers killing flies You have made good work You and your apron men you that stood so much Upon the voice of occupation and The breath of garlic eaters He 'll shake Your Rome about your ears As Hercules Did shake down mellow fruit You have made fair work But is this true sir Ay and you 'll look pale Before you find it other All the regions Do smilingly revolt and who resists Are mock'd for valiant ignorance And perish constant fools Who is't can blame him Your enemies and his find something in him We are all undone unless The noble man have mercy Who shall ask it The tribunes can not do't for shame the people Deserve such pity of him as the wolf Does of the shepherds for his best friends if they Should say ' Be good to Rome'- they charg'd him even As those should do that had deserv'd his hate And therein show'd fike enemies ' Tis true If he were putting to my house the brand That should consume it I have not the face To say ' Beseech you cease ' You have made fair hands You and your crafts You have crafted fair You have brought A trembling upon Rome such as was never S ' incapable of help Say not we brought it How Was't we We lov'd him but like beasts And cowardly nobles gave way unto your clusters Who did hoot him out o ' th ' city But I fear They 'll roar him in again Tullus Aufidius The second name of men obeys his points As if he were his officer Desperation Is all the policy strength and defence That Rome can make against them Here comes the clusters And is Aufidius with him You are they That made the air unwholesome when you cast Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at Coriolanus ' exile Now he 's coming And not a hair upon a soldier 's head Which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs As you threw caps up will he tumble down And pay you for your voices ' Tis no matter If he could burn us all into one coal We have deserv'd it Faith we hear fearful news For mine own part When I said banish him I said ' twas pity And so did I. And so did I and to say the truth so did very many of us That we did we did for the best and though we willingly consented to his banishment yet it was against our will Y'are goodly things you voices You have made Good work you and your cry Shall 's to the Capitol O ay what else Go masters get you be not dismay'd These are a side that would be glad to have This true which they so seem to fear Go home And show no sign of fear The gods be good to us Come masters let 's home I ever said we were i ' th ' wrong when we banish'd him So did we all But come let 's home I do not like this news Nor I. Let 's to the Capitol Would half my wealth Would buy this for a lie Pray let 's go Exeunt Do they still fly to th ' Roman I do not know what witchcraft 's in him but Your soldiers use him as the grace fore meat Their talk at table and their thanks at end And you are dark'ned in this action sir Even by your own I can not help it now Unless by using means I lame the foot Of our design He bears himself more proudlier Even to my person than I thought he would When first I did embrace him yet his nature In that 's no changeling and I must excuse What can not be amended Yet I wish sir- I mean for your particular- you had not Join'd in commission with him but either Had borne the action of yourself or else To him had left it solely I understand thee well and be thou sure When he shall come to his account he knows not What I can urge against him Although it seems And so he thinks and is no less apparent To th ' vulgar eye that he bears all things fairly And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state Fights dragon like and does achieve as soon As draw his sword yet he hath left undone That which shall break his neck or hazard mine Whene'er we come to our account Sir I beseech you think you he 'll carry Rome All places yield to him ere he sits down And the nobility of Rome are his The senators and patricians love him too The tribunes are no soldiers and their people Will be as rash in the repeal as hasty To expel him thence I think he 'll be to Rome As is the osprey to the fish who takes it By sovereignty of nature First he was A noble servant to them but he could not Carry his honours even Whether ' twas pride Which out of daily fortune ever taints The happy man whether defect of judgment To fail in the disposing of those chances Which he was lord of or whether nature Not to be other than one thing not moving From th ' casque to th ' cushion but commanding peace Even with the same austerity and garb As he controll'd the war but one of these- As he hath spices of them all- not all For I dare so far free him- made him fear'd So hated and so banish'd But he has a merit To choke it in the utt'rance So our virtues Lie in th ' interpretation of the time And power unto itself most commendable Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair T ' extol what it hath done One fire drives out one fire one nail one nail Rights by rights falter strengths by strengths do fail Come let 's away When Caius Rome is thine Thou art poor'st of all then shortly art thou mine No I 'll not go You hear what he hath said Which was sometime his general who lov'd him In a most dear particular He call'd me father But what o ' that Go you that banish'd him A mile before his tent fall down and knee The way into his mercy Nay if he coy'd To hear Cominius speak I 'll keep at home He would not seem to know me Do you hear Yet one time he did call me by my name I urg'd our old acquaintance and the drops That we have bled together ' Coriolanus ' He would not answer to forbid all names He was a kind of nothing titleless Till he had forg'd himself a name i ' th ' fire Of burning Rome Why so You have made good work A pair of tribunes that have wrack'd for Rome To make coals cheap- a noble memory I minded him how royal ' twas to pardon When it was less expected he replied It was a bare petition of a state To one whom they had punish'd Very well Could he say less I offer'd to awaken his regard For 's private friends his answer to me was He could not stay to pick them in a pile Of noisome musty chaff He said ' twas folly For one poor grain or two to leave unburnt And still to nose th ' offence For one poor grain or two I am one of those His mother wife his child And this brave fellow too- we are the grains You are the musty chaff and you are smelt Above the moon We must be burnt for you Nay pray be patient if you refuse your aid In this so never needed help yet do not Upbraid 's with our distress But sure if you Would be your country 's pleader your good tongue More than the instant army we can make Might stop our countryman No I 'll not meddle Pray you go to him What should I do Only make trial what your love can do For Rome towards Marcius Well and say that Marcius Return me as Cominius is return'd Unheard- what then But as a discontented friend grief shot With his unkindness Say't be so Yet your good will Must have that thanks from Rome after the measure As you intended well I 'll undertake't I think he 'll hear me Yet to bite his lip And hum at good Cominius much unhearts me He was not taken well he had not din'd The veins unfill'd our blood is cold and then We pout upon the morning are unapt To give or to forgive but when we have stuff'd These pipes and these conveyances of our blood With wine and feeding we have suppler souls Than in our priest like fasts Therefore I 'll watch him Till he be dieted to my request And then I 'll set upon him You know the very road into his kindness And can not lose your way Good faith I 'll prove him Speed how it will I shall ere long have knowledge Of my success Exit He 'll never hear him Not I tell you he does sit in gold his eye Red as ' twould burn Rome and his injury The gaoler to his pity I kneel'd before him ' Twas very faintly he said ' Rise ' dismiss'd me Thus with his speechless hand What he would do He sent in writing after me what he would not Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions So that all hope is vain Unless his noble mother and his wife Who as I hear mean to solicit him For mercy to his country Therefore let 's hence And with our fair entreaties haste them on Exeunt Stay Whence are you Stand and go back You guard like men ' tis well but by your leave I am an officer of state and come To speak with Coriolanus From whence From Rome YOU may not pass you must return Our general Will no more hear from thence You 'll see your Rome embrac'd with fire before You 'll speak with Coriolanus Good my friends If you have heard your general talk of Rome And of his friends there it is lots to blanks My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius Be it so go back The virtue of your name Is not here passable I tell thee fellow Thy general is my lover I have been The book of his good acts whence men have read His fame unparallel'd haply amplified For I have ever verified my friends- Of whom he 's chief- with all the size that verity Would without lapsing suffer Nay sometimes Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground I have tumbled past the throw and in his praise Have almost stamp'd the leasing therefore fellow I must have leave to pass Faith sir if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own you should not pass here no though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely Therefore go back Prithee fellow remember my name is Menenius always factionary on the party of your general Howsoever you have been his liar as you say you have I am one that telling true under him must say you can not pass Therefore go back Has he din'd canst thou tell For I would not speak with him till after dinner You are a Roman are you I am as thy general is Then you should hate Rome as he does Can you when you have push'd out your gates the very defender of them and in a violent popular ignorance given your enemy your shield think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women the virginal palms of your daughters or with the palsied intercession of such a decay'd dotant as you seem to be Can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in with such weak breath as this No you are deceiv'd therefore back to Rome and prepare for your execution You are condemn'd our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon Sirrah if thy captain knew I were here he would use me with estimation Come my captain knows you not I mean thy general My general cares not for you Back I say go lest I let forth your half pint of blood Back- that 's the utmost of your having Back Nay but fellow fellow- What 's the matter Now you companion I 'll say an errand for you you shall know now that I am in estimation you shall perceive that a Jack guardant can not office me from my son Coriolanus Guess but by my entertainment with him if thou stand'st not i ' th ' state of hanging or of some death more long in spectatorship and crueller in suffering behold now presently and swoon for what 's to come upon thee The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity and love thee no worse than thy old father Menenius does O my son my son thou art preparing fire for us look thee here 's water to quench it I was hardly moved to come to thee but being assured none but myself could move thee I have been blown out of your gates with sighs and conjure thee to pardon Rome and thy petitionary countrymen The good gods assuage thy wrath and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here this who like a block hath denied my access to thee Away How away Wife mother child I know not My affairs Are servanted to others Though I owe My revenge properly my remission lies In Volscian breasts That we have been familiar Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison rather Than pity note how much Therefore be gone Mine ears against your suits are stronger than Your gates against my force Yet for I lov'd thee Take this along I writ it for thy sake Gives a letter And would have sent it Another word Menenius I will not hear thee speak This man Aufidius Was my belov'd in Rome yet thou behold'st You keep a constant temper Now sir is your name Menenius ' Tis a spell you see of much power You know the way home again Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back What cause do you think I have to swoon I neither care for th ' world nor your general for such things as you I can scarce think there 's any y'are so slight He that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another Let your general do his worst For you be that you are long and your misery increase with your age I say to you as I was said to Away Exit A noble fellow I warrant him The worthy fellow is our general he 's the rock the oak not to be wind shaken Exeunt We will before the walls of Rome to morrow Set down our host My partner in this action You must report to th ' Volscian lords how plainly I have borne this business Only their ends You have respected stopp'd your ears against The general suit of Rome never admitted A private whisper- no not with such friends That thought them sure of you This last old man Whom with crack'd heart I have sent to Rome Lov'd me above the measure of a father Nay godded me indeed Their latest refuge Was to send him for whose old love I have- Though I show'd sourly to him- once more offer'd The first conditions which they did refuse And can not now accept To grace him only That thought he could do more a very little I have yielded to fresh embassies and suits Nor from the state nor private friends hereafter Will I lend ear to Shout within Ha what shout is this Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow In the same time ' tis made I will not My lord and husband These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome The sorrow that delivers us thus chang'd Makes you think so Like a dull actor now I have forgot my part and I am out Even to a full disgrace Best of my flesh Forgive my tyranny but do not say For that ' Forgive our Romans ' O a kiss Long as my exile sweet as my revenge Now by the jealous queen of heaven that kiss I carried from thee dear and my true lip Hath virgin'd it e'er since You gods I prate And the most noble mother of the world Leave unsaluted Sink my knee i ' th ' earth Kneels Of thy deep duty more impression show Than that of common sons O stand up blest Whilst with no softer cushion than the flint I kneel before thee and unproperly Show duty as mistaken all this while Between the child and parent Kneels What 's this Your knees to me to your corrected son Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach Fillip the stars then let the mutinous winds Strike the proud cedars ' gainst the fiery sun Murd'ring impossibility to make What can not be slight work Thou art my warrior I holp to frame thee Do you know this lady The noble sister of Publicola The moon of Rome chaste as the icicle That 's curdied by the frost from purest snow And hangs on Dian 's temple- dear Valeria This is a poor epitome of yours Which by th ' interpretation of full time May show like all yourself The god of soldiers With the consent of supreme Jove inform Thy thoughts with nobleness that thou mayst prove To shame unvulnerable and stick i ' th ' wars Like a great sea mark standing every flaw And saving those that eye thee Your knee sirrah That 's my brave boy Even he your wife this lady and myself Are suitors to you I beseech you peace Or if you 'd ask remember this before The thing I have forsworn to grant may never Be held by you denials Do not bid me Dismiss my soldiers or capitulate Again with Rome 's mechanics Tell me not Wherein I seem unnatural desire not T'allay my rages and revenges with Your colder reasons O no more no more You have said you will not grant us any thing- For we have nothing else to ask but that Which you deny already yet we will ask That if you fail in our request the blame May hang upon your hardness therefore hear us Aufidius and you Volsces mark for we 'll Hear nought from Rome in private Your request Should we be silent and not speak our raiment And state of bodies would bewray what life We have led since thy exile Think with thyself How more unfortunate than all living women Are we come hither since that thy sight which should Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow Making the mother wife and child to see The son the husband and the father tearing His country 's bowels out And to poor we Thine enmity 's most capital thou bar'st us Our prayers to the gods which is a comfort That all but we enjoy For how can we Alas how can we for our country pray Whereto we are bound together with thy victory Whereto we are bound Alack or we must lose The country our dear nurse or else thy person Our comfort in the country We must find An evident calamity though we had Our wish which side should win for either thou Must as a foreign recreant be led With manacles through our streets or else Triumphantly tread on thy country 's ruin And bear the palm for having bravely shed Thy wife and children 's blood For myself son I purpose not to wait on fortune till These wars determine if I can not persuade thee Rather to show a noble grace to both parts Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread- Trust to't thou shalt not- on thy mother 's womb That brought thee to this world Ay and mine That brought you forth this boy to keep your name Living to time ' A shall not tread on me I 'll run away till I am bigger but then I 'll fight Not of a woman 's tenderness to be Requires nor child nor woman 's face to see I have sat too long Rising Nay go not from us thus If it were so that our request did tend To save the Romans thereby to destroy The Volsces whom you serve you might condemn us As poisonous of your honour No our suit Is that you reconcile them while the Volsces May say ' This mercy we have show'd ' the Romans ' This we receiv'd ' and each in either side Give the all hail to thee and cry ' Be blest For making up this peace ' Thou know'st great son The end of war 's uncertain but this certain That if thou conquer Rome the benefit Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses Whose chronicle thus writ ' The man was noble But with his last attempt he wip'd it out Destroy'd his country and his name remains To th ' ensuing age abhorr'd ' Speak to me son Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour To imitate the graces of the gods To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o ' th ' air And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt That should but rive an oak Why dost not speak Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man Still to remember wrongs Daughter speak you He cares not for your weeping Speak thou boy Perhaps thy childishness will move him more Than can our reasons There 's no man in the world More bound to 's mother yet here he lets me prate Like one i ' th ' stocks Thou hast never in thy life Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy When she poor hen fond of no second brood Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home Loaden with honour Say my request 's unjust And spurn me back but if it he not so Thou art not honest and the gods will plague thee That thou restrain'st from me the duty which To a mother 's part belongs He turns away Down ladies let us shame him with our knees To his surname Coriolanus ' longs more pride Than pity to our prayers Down An end This is the last So we will home to Rome And die among our neighbours Nay behold 's This boy that can not tell what he would have But kneels and holds up hands for fellowship Does reason our petition with more strength Than thou hast to deny't Come let us go This fellow had a Volscian to his mother His wife is in Corioli and his child Like him by chance Yet give us our dispatch I am hush'd until our city be afire And then I 'll speak a little O mother mother What have you done Behold the heavens do ope The gods look down and this unnatural scene They laugh at O my mother mother O You have won a happy victory to Rome But for your son- believe it O believe it!- Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd If not most mortal to him But let it come Aufidius though I can not make true wars I 'll frame convenient peace Now good Aufidius Were you in my stead would you have heard A mother less or granted less Aufidius I was mov'd withal I dare be sworn you were And sir it is no little thing to make Mine eyes to sweat compassion But good sir What peace you'fl make advise me For my part I 'll not to Rome I 'll back with you and pray you Stand to me in this cause O mother wife Aside I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy To the ladies Ay by and by But we will drink together and you shall bear A better witness back than words which we On like conditions will have counter seal'd Come enter with us Ladies you deserve To have a temple built you All the swords In Italy and her confederate arms Could not have made this peace Exeunt See you yond coign o ' th ' Capitol yond cornerstone Why what of that If it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger there is some hope the ladies of Rome especially his mother may prevail with him But I say there is no hope in't our throats are sentenc'd and stay upon execution Is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man There is differency between a grub and a butterfly yet your butterfly was a grub This Marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings he 's more than a creeping thing He lov'd his mother dearly So did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an eight year old horse The tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks he moves like an engine and the ground shrinks before his treading He is able to pierce a corslet with his eye talks like a knell and his hum is a battery He sits in his state as a thing made for Alexander What he bids be done is finish'd with his bidding He wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in Yes- mercy if you report him truly I paint him in the character Mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him There is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger that shall our poor city find And all this is ' long of you The gods be good unto us No in such a case the gods will not be good unto us When we banish'd him we respected not them and he returning to break our necks they respect not us Sir if you 'd save your life fly to your house The plebeians have got your fellow tribune And hale him up and down all swearing if The Roman ladies bring not comfort home They 'll give him death by inches What 's the news Good news good news The ladies have prevail'd The Volscians are dislodg'd and Marcius gone A merrier day did never yet greet Rome No not th ' expulsion of the Tarquins Friend Art thou certain this is true Is't most certain As certain as I know the sun is fire Where have you lurk'd that you make doubt of it Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide As the recomforted through th ' gates Why hark you This is good news I will go meet the ladies This Volumnia Is worth of consuls senators patricians A city full of tribunes such as you A sea and land full You have pray'd well to day This morning for ten thousand of your throats I 'd not have given a doit Hark how they joy First the gods bless you for your tidings next Accept my thankfulness Sir we have all Great cause to give great thanks They are near the city Almost at point to enter We 'll meet them And help the joy Exeunt Behold our patroness the life of Rome Call all your tribes together praise the gods And make triumphant fires strew flowers before them Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius Repeal him with the welcome of his mother Welcome ladies welcome Go tell the lords o ' th ' city I am here Deliver them this paper ' having read it Bid them repair to th ' market place where I Even in theirs and in the commons ' ears Will vouch the truth of it Him I accuse The city ports by this hath enter'd and Intends t ' appear before the people hoping To purge himself with words Dispatch How is it with our general Even so As with a man by his own alms empoison'd And with his charity slain Most noble sir If you do hold the same intent wherein You wish'd us parties we 'll deliver you Of your great danger Sir I can not tell We must proceed as we do find the people The people will remain uncertain whilst ' Twixt you there 's difference but the fall of either Makes the survivor heir of all I know it And my pretext to strike at him admits A good construction I rais'd him and I pawn'd Mine honour for his truth who being so heighten'd He watered his new plants with dews of flattery Seducing so my friends and to this end He bow'd his nature never known before But to be rough unswayable and free Sir his stoutness When he did stand for consul which he lost By lack of stooping- That I would have spoken of Being banish'd for't he came unto my hearth Presented to my knife his throat I took him Made him joint servant with me gave him way In all his own desires nay let him choose Out of my files his projects to accomplish My best and freshest men serv'd his designments In mine own person holp to reap the fame Which he did end all his and took some pride To do myself this wrong Till at the last I seem'd his follower not partner and He wag'd me with his countenance as if I had been mercenary So he did my lord The army marvell'd at it and in the last When he had carried Rome and that we look'd For no less spoil than glory- There was it For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him At a few drops of women 's rheum which are As cheap as lies he sold the blood and labour Of our great action therefore shall he die And I 'll renew me in his fall But hark Your native town you enter'd like a post And had no welcomes home but he returns Splitting the air with noise And patient fools Whose children he hath slain their base throats tear With giving him glory Therefore at your vantage Ere he express himself or move the people With what he would say let him feel your sword Which we will second When he lies along After your way his tale pronounc'd shall bury His reasons with his body Say no more Here come the lords You are most welcome home I have not deserv'd it But worthy lords have you with heed perused What I have written to you We have And grieve to hear't What faults he made before the last I think Might have found easy fines but there to end Where he was to begin and give away The benefit of our levies answering us With our own charge making a treaty where There was a yielding- this admits no excuse He approaches you shall hear him Hail lords I am return'd your soldier No more infected with my country 's love Than when I parted hence but still subsisting Under your great command You are to know That prosperously I have attempted and With bloody passage led your wars even to The gates of Rome Our spoils we have brought home Doth more than counterpoise a full third part The charges of the action We have made peace With no less honour to the Antiates Than shame to th ' Romans and we here deliver Subscrib'd by th ' consuls and patricians Together with the seal o ' th ' Senate what We have compounded on Read it not noble lords But tell the traitor in the highest degree He hath abus'd your powers Traitor How now Ay traitor Marcius Marcius Ay Marcius Caius Marcius Dost thou think I 'll grace thee with that robbery thy stol'n name Coriolanus in Corioli You lords and heads o ' th ' state perfidiously He has betray'd your business and given up For certain drops of salt your city Rome- I say your city- to his wife and mother Breaking his oath and resolution like A twist of rotten silk never admitting Counsel o ' th ' war but at his nurse 's tears He whin'd and roar'd away your victory That pages blush'd at him and men of heart Look'd wond'ring each at others Hear'st thou Mars Name not the god thou boy of tears- Ha -no more Measureless liar thou hast made my heart Too great for what contains it ' Boy ' O slave Pardon me lords ' tis the first time that ever I was forc'd to scold Your judgments my grave lords Must give this cur the lie and his own notion- Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him that Must bear my beating to his grave- shall join To thrust the lie unto him Peace both and hear me speak Cut me to pieces Volsces men and lads Stain all your edges on me ' Boy ' False hound If you have writ your annals true ' tis there That like an eagle in a dove cote I Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli Alone I did it ' Boy ' Why noble lords Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune Which was your shame by this unholy braggart Fore your own eyes and ears Let him die for't Tear him to pieces Do it presently He kill'd my son My daughter He kill'd my cousin Marcus He kill'd my father Peace ho No outrage- peace The man is noble and his fame folds in This orb o ' th ' earth His last offences to us Shall have judicious hearing Stand Aufidius And trouble not the peace O that I had him With six Aufidiuses or more- his tribe To use my lawful sword Insolent villain Kill kill kill kill kill him Hold hold hold hold My noble masters hear me speak O Tullus Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep Tread not upon him Masters all be quiet Put up your swords My lords when you shall know- as in this rage Provok'd by him you cannot- the great danger Which this man 's life did owe you you 'll rejoice That he is thus cut off Please it your honours To call me to your Senate I 'll deliver Myself your loyal servant or endure Your heaviest censure Bear from hence his body And mourn you for him Let him be regarded As the most noble corse that ever herald Did follow to his um His own impatience Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame Let 's make the best of it My rage is gone And I am struck with sorrow Take him up Help three o ' th ' chiefest soldiers I 'll be one Beat thou the drum that it speak mournfully Trail your steel pikes Though in this city he Hath widowed and unchilded many a one Which to this hour bewail the injury Yet he shall have a noble memory Assist Exeunt bearing the body of CORIOLANUS You do not meet a man but frowns our bloods No more obey the heavens than our courtiers Still seem as does the King 's But what 's the matter His daughter and the heir of 's kingdom whom He purpos'd to his wife 's sole son- a widow That late he married- hath referr'd herself Unto a poor but worthy gentleman She 's wedded Her husband banish'd she imprison'd All Is outward sorrow though I think the King Be touch'd at very heart None but the King He that hath lost her too So is the Queen That most desir'd the match But not a courtier Although they wear their faces to the bent Of the King 's looks hath a heart that is not Glad at the thing they scowl at And why so He that hath miss'd the Princess is a thing Too bad for bad report and he that hath her- I mean that married her alack good man And therefore banish'd- is a creature such As to seek through the regions of the earth For one his like there would be something failing In him that should compare I do not think So fair an outward and such stuff within Endows a man but he You speak him far I do extend him sir within himself Crush him together rather than unfold His measure duly What 's his name and birth I can not delve him to the root his father Was call'd Sicilius who did join his honour Against the Romans with Cassibelan But had his titles by Tenantius whom He serv'd with glory and admir'd success So gain'd the sur addition Leonatus And had besides this gentleman in question Two other sons who in the wars o ' th ' time Died with their swords in hand for which their father Then old and fond of issue took such sorrow That he quit being and his gentle lady Big of this gentleman our theme deceas'd As he was born The King he takes the babe To his protection calls him Posthumus Leonatus Breeds him and makes him of his bed chamber Puts to him all the learnings that his time Could make him the receiver of which he took As we do air fast as ' twas minist'red And in 's spring became a harvest liv'd in court- Which rare it is to do- most prais'd most lov'd A sample to the youngest to th ' more mature A glass that feated them and to the graver A child that guided dotards To his mistress For whom he now is banish'd- her own price Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue By her election may be truly read What kind of man he is I honour him Even out of your report But pray you tell me Is she sole child to th ' King His only child He had two sons- if this be worth your hearing Mark it- the eldest of them at three years old I ' th ' swathing clothes the other from their nursery Were stol'n and to this hour no guess in knowledge Which way they went How long is this ago Some twenty years That a king 's children should be so convey'd So slackly guarded and the search so slow That could not trace them Howsoe'er ' tis strange Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at Yet is it true sir I do well believe you We must forbear here comes the gentleman The Queen and Princess Exeunt No be assur'd you shall not find me daughter After the slander of most stepmothers Evil ey'd unto you You 're my prisoner but Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys That lock up your restraint For you Posthumus So soon as I can win th ' offended King I will be known your advocate Marry yet The fire of rage is in him and ' twere good You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience Your wisdom may inform you Please your Highness I will from hence to day You know the peril I 'll fetch a turn about the garden pitying The pangs of barr'd affections though the King Hath charg'd you should not speak together Exit O dissembling courtesy How fine this tyrant Can tickle where she wounds My dearest husband I something fear my father 's wrath but nothing- Always reserv'd my holy duty- what His rage can do on me You must be gone And I shall here abide the hourly shot Of angry eyes not comforted to live But that there is this jewel in the world That I may see again My queen my mistress O lady weep no more lest I give cause To be suspected of more tenderness Than doth become a man I will remain The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth My residence in Rome at one Philario 's Who to my father was a friend to me Known but by letter thither write my queen And with mine eyes I 'll drink the words you send Though ink be made of gall Be brief I pray you If the King come I shall incur I know not How much of his displeasure Aside Yet I 'll move him To walk this way I never do him wrong But he does buy my injuries to be friends Pays dear for my offences Exit Should we be taking leave As long a term as yet we have to live The loathness to depart would grow Adieu Nay stay a little Were you but riding forth to air yourself Such parting were too petty Look here love This diamond was my mother 's take it heart But keep it till you woo another wife When Imogen is dead How how Another You gentle gods give me but this I have And sear up my embracements from a next With bonds of death Remain remain thou here O the gods When shall we see again Alack the King Thou basest thing avoid hence from my sight If after this command thou fraught the court With thy unworthiness thou diest Away Thou'rt poison to my blood The gods protect you And bless the good remainders of the court I am gone Exit There can not be a pinch in death More sharp than this is O disloyal thing That shouldst repair my youth thou heap'st A year 's age on me I beseech you sir Harm not yourself with your vexation I am senseless of your wrath a touch more rare Subdues all pangs all fears Past grace obedience Past hope and in despair that way past grace That mightst have had the sole son of my queen O blessed that I might not I chose an eagle And did avoid a puttock Thou took'st a beggar wouldst have made my throne A seat for baseness No I rather added A lustre to it O thou vile one Sir It is your fault that I have lov'd Posthumus You bred him as my playfellow and he is A man worth any woman overbuys me Almost the sum he pays What art thou mad Almost sir Heaven restore me Would I were A neat herd 's daughter and my Leonatus Our neighbour shepherd 's son Thou foolish thing To the QUEEN They were again together You have done Not after our command Away with her And pen her up Beseech your patience.- Peace Dear lady daughter peace!- Sweet sovereign Leave us to ourselves and make yourself some comfort Out of your best advice Nay let her languish A drop of blood a day and being aged Die of this folly Exit with LORDS Fie you must give way Here is your servant How now sir What news My lord your son drew on my master Ha No harm I trust is done There might have been But that my master rather play'd than fought And had no help of anger they were parted By gentlemen at hand I am very glad on't Your son 's my father 's friend he takes his part To draw upon an exile O brave sir I would they were in Afric both together Myself by with a needle that I might prick The goer back Why came you from your master On his command He would not suffer me To bring him to the haven left these notes Of what commands I should be subject to When't pleas'd you to employ me This hath been Your faithful servant I dare lay mine honour He will remain so I humbly thank your Highness Pray walk awhile About some half hour hence Pray you speak with me You shall at least Go see my lord aboard For this time leave me Exeunt Sir I would advise you to shift a shirt the violence of action hath made you reek as a sacrifice Where air comes out air comes in there 's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent If my shirt were bloody then to shift it Have I hurt him Aside No faith not so much as his patience Hurt him His body 's a passable carcass if he be not hurt It is a throughfare for steel if it be not hurt Aside His steel was in debt it went o ' th ' back side the town The villain would not stand me Aside No but he fled forward still toward your face Stand you You have land enough of your own but he added to your having gave you some ground Aside As many inches as you have oceans Puppies I would they had not come between us Aside So would I till you had measur'd how long a fool you were upon the ground And that she should love this fellow and refuse me Aside If it be a sin to make a true election she is damn'd Sir as I told you always her beauty and her brain go not together she 's a good sign but I have seen small reflection of her wit Aside She shines not upon fools lest the reflection should hurt her Come I 'll to my chamber Would there had been some hurt done Aside I wish not so unless it had been the fall of an ass which is no great hurt You 'll go with us I 'll attend your lordship Nay come let 's go together Well my lord Exeunt I would thou grew'st unto the shores o ' th ' haven And questioned'st every sail if he should write And I not have it ' twere a paper lost As offer'd mercy is What was the last That he spake to thee It was his queen his queen Then wav'd his handkerchief And kiss'd it madam Senseless linen happier therein than I And that was all No madam for so long As he could make me with his eye or care Distinguish him from others he did keep The deck with glove or hat or handkerchief Still waving as the fits and stirs of 's mind Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on How swift his ship Thou shouldst have made him As little as a crow or less ere left To after eye him Madam so I did I would have broke mine eyestrings crack'd them but To look upon him till the diminution Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle Nay followed him till he had melted from The smallness of a gnat to air and then Have turn'd mine eye and wept But good Pisanio When shall we hear from him Be assur'd madam With his next vantage I did not take my leave of him but had Most pretty things to say Ere I could tell him How I would think on him at certain hours Such thoughts and such or I could make him swear The she s of Italy should not betray Mine interest and his honour or have charg'd him At the sixth hour of morn at noon at midnight T ' encounter me with orisons for then I am in heaven for him or ere I could Give him that parting kiss which I had set Betwixt two charming words comes in my father And like the tyrannous breathing of the north Shakes all our buds from growing The Queen madam Desires your Highness ' company Those things I bid you do get them dispatch'd I will attend the Queen Madam I shall Exeunt Believe it sir I have seen him in Britain He was then of a crescent note expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of But I could then have look'd on him without the help of admiration though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items You speak of him when he was less furnish'd than now he is with that which makes him both without and within I have seen him in France we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he This matter of marrying his king 's daughter wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own words him I doubt not a great deal from the matter And then his banishment Ay and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him be it but to fortify her judgment which else an easy battery might lay flat for taking a beggar without less quality But how comes it he is to sojourn with you How creeps acquaintance His father and I were soldiers together to whom I have been often bound for no less than my life Sir we have known together in Orleans Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still Sir you o'errate my poor kindness I was glad I did atone my countryman and you it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature By your pardon sir I was then a young traveller rather shunn'd to go even with what I heard than in my every action to be guided by others ' experiences but upon my mended judgment- if I offend not to say it is mended- my quarrel was not altogether slight Faith yes to be put to the arbitrement of swords and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other or have fall'n both Can we with manners ask what was the difference Safely I think ' Twas a contention in public which may without contradiction suffer the report It was much like an argument that fell out last night where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses this gentleman at that time vouching- and upon warrant of bloody affirmation- his to be more fair virtuous wise chaste constant qualified and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in France That lady is not now living or this gentleman 's opinion by this worn out She holds her virtue still and I my mind You must not so far prefer her fore ours of Italy Being so far provok'd as I was in France I would abate her nothing though I profess myself her adorer not her friend As fair and as good- a kind of hand in hand comparison- had been something too fair and too good for any lady in Britain If she went before others I have seen as that diamond of yours outlustres many I have beheld I could not but believe she excelled many but I have not seen the most precious diamond that is nor you the lady I prais'd her as I rated her So do I my stone What do you esteem it at More than the world enjoys Either your unparagon'd mistress is dead or she 's outpriz'd by a trifle You are mistaken the one may be sold or given if there were wealth enough for the purchase or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale and only the gift of the gods Which the gods have given you Which by their graces I will keep You may wear her in title yours but you know strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds Your ring may be stol'n too So your brace of unprizable estimations the one is but frail and the other casual a cunning thief or a that way accomplish'd courtier would hazard the winning both of first and last Your Italy contains none so accomplish'd a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress if in the holding or loss of that you term her frail I do nothing doubt you have store of thieves notwithstanding I fear not my ring Let us leave here gentlemen Sir with all my heart This worthy signior I thank him makes no stranger of me we are familiar at first With five times so much conversation I should get ground of your fair mistress make her go back even to the yielding had I admittance and opportunity to friend No no I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring which in my opinion o'ervalues it something But I make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and to bar your offence herein too I durst attempt it against any lady in the world You are a great deal abus'd in too bold a persuasion and I doubt not you sustain what y'are worthy of by your attempt What 's that A repulse though your attempt as you call it deserve more- a punishment too Gentlemen enough of this It came in too suddenly let it die as it was born and I pray you be better acquainted Would I had put my estate and my neighbour 's on th ' approbation of what I have spoke What lady would you choose to assail Yours whom in constancy you think stands so safe I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring that commend me to the court where your lady is with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference and I will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserv'd I will wage against your gold gold to it My ring I hold dear as my finger ' tis part of it You are a friend and therein the wiser If you buy ladies ' flesh at a million a dram you can not preserve it from tainting But I see you have some religion in you that you fear This is but a custom in your tongue you bear a graver purpose I hope I am the master of my speeches and would undergo what 's spoken I swear Will you I Shall but lend my diamond till your return Let there be covenants drawn between 's My mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking I dare you to this match here 's my ring I will have it no lay By the gods it is one If I bring you no sufficient testimony that I have enjoy'd the dearest bodily part of your mistress my ten thousand ducats are yours so is your diamond too If I come off and leave her in such honour as you have trust in she your jewel this your jewel and my gold are yours- provided I have your commendation for my more free entertainment I embrace these conditions let us have articles betwixt us Only thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevail'd I am no further your enemy- she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduc'd you not making it appear otherwise for your ill opinion and th ' assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword Your hand- a covenant We will have these things set down by lawful counsel and straight away for Britain lest the bargain should catch cold and starve I will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded Agreed Exeunt POSTHUMUS and IACHIMO Will this hold think you Signior Iachimo will not from it Pray let us follow 'em Whiles yet the dew 's on ground gather those flowers Make haste who has the note of them I madam Dispatch Exeunt LADIES Now Master Doctor have you brought those drugs Pleaseth your Highness ay Here they are madam I wonder Doctor Thou ask'st me such a question Have I not been Thy pupil long Hast thou not learn'd me how To make perfumes distil preserve yea so That our great king himself doth woo me oft For my confections Having thus far proceeded- Unless thou think'st me devilish- is't not meet That I did amplify my judgment in Other conclusions I will try the forces Of these thy compounds on such creatures as We count not worth the hanging- but none human- To try the vigour of them and apply Allayments to their act and by them gather Their several virtues and effects Your Highness Shall from this practice but make hard your heart Besides the seeing these effects will be Both noisome and infectious O content thee Aside I do suspect you madam But you shall do no harm To PISANIO Hark thee a word Aside I do not like her She doth think she has Strange ling'ring poisons I do know her spirit And will not trust one of her malice with A drug of such damn'd nature Those she has Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile Which first perchance she 'll prove on cats and dogs Then afterward up higher but there is No danger in what show of death it makes More than the locking up the spirits a time To be more fresh reviving She is fool'd With a most false effect and I the truer So to be false with her No further service Doctor Until I send for thee I humbly take my leave Exit Weeps she still say'st thou Dost thou think in time She will not quench and let instructions enter Where folly now possesses Do thou work When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son I 'll tell thee on the instant thou art then As great as is thy master greater for His fortunes all lie speechless and his name Is at last gasp Return he can not nor Continue where he is To shift his being Is to exchange one misery with another And every day that comes comes comes to A day 's work in him What shalt thou expect To be depender on a thing that leans Who can not be new built nor has no friends So much as but to prop him And shall do But when to my good lord I prove untrue I 'll choke myself- there 's all I 'll do for you Exit A father cruel and a step dame false A foolish suitor to a wedded lady That hath her husband banish'd O that husband My supreme crown of grief and those repeated Vexations

He is call'd The Britain reveller When he was here He did incline to sadness and oft times Not knowing why I never saw him sad There is a Frenchman his companion one An eminent monsieur that it seems

sheets That I might touch But kiss one kiss Rubies unparagon'd How dearly they do't ' Tis her breathing that Perfumes the chamber thus The flame o ' th ' taper Bows toward her and would under peep her lids To see th ' enclosed lights now canopied Under these windows white and azure lac'd With blue of heaven 's own tinct But my design To note the chamber I will write all down Such and such pictures there the window such Th ' adornment of her bed the arras figures- Why such and such and the contents o ' th ' story Ah but some natural notes about her body Above ten thousand meaner movables Would testify t ' enrich mine inventory O sleep thou ape of death lie dull upon her And be her sense but as a monument Thus in a chapel lying Come off come off Your lordship is the most patient man in loss the most coldest that ever turn'd up ace It would make any man cold to lose But not every man patient after the noble temper of your lordship You are most hot and furious when you win Winning will put

and to my gracious mother Attend you here the door of our stern daughter Will she not forth I have assail'd her with musics but she vouchsafes no notice The exile of her minion is too new She hath not yet forgot him some more time Must wear the print of his remembrance out And then she 's yours You are most bound to th ' King Who lets go by no vantages that may Prefer you to his daughter Frame yourself To orderly soliciting and be friended With aptness of the season make denials Increase your services so seem as if You were inspir'd to do those duties which You tender to her that you in all obey her Save when command to your dismission tends And therein you are senseless Senseless Not so So like you sir ambassadors from Rome The one is Caius Lucius A worthy fellow Albeit he comes on angry purpose now But that 's no fault of his We must receive him According to the honour of his sender And towards himself his goodness forespent on us We must extend our notice Our dear son When you have given good morning to your mistress Attend the Queen and us we shall have need T ' employ you towards this Roman Come our queen If she be up I 'll speak with her if not Let her lie still and dream By your leave ho Knocks I know her women are about her what If I do line one of their hands ' Tis gold Which buys admittance oft it doth yea and makes Diana 's rangers false themselves yield up Their deer to th ' stand o ' th ' stealer and ' tis gold Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief Nay sometime hangs both thief and true man What Can it not do and undo I will make One of her women lawyer to me for I yet not understand the case myself By your leave Knocks Who 's there that knocks A gentleman No more Yes and a gentlewoman 's son That 's more Than some whose tailors are as dear as yours Can justly boast of What 's your lordship 's pleasure Your lady 's person is she ready Ay To keep her chamber There is gold for you sell me your good report How My good name or to report of you What I shall think is good The Princess Good morrow fairest sister Your sweet hand Good morrow sir You lay out too much pains For purchasing but trouble The thanks I give Is telling you that I am poor of thanks And scarce can spare them Still I swear I love you If you but said so ' twere as deep with me If you swear still your recompense is still That I regard it not This is no answer But that you shall not say I yield being silent I would not speak I pray you spare me Faith I shall unfold equal discourtesy To your best kindness one of your great knowing Should learn being taught forbearance To leave you in your madness ' twere my sin I will not Fools are not mad folks Do you call me fool As I am mad I do If you 'll be patient I 'll no more be mad That cures us both I am much sorry sir You put me to forget a lady 's manners By being so verbal and learn now for all That I which know my heart do here pronounce By th ' very truth of it I care not for you And am so near the lack of charity To accuse myself I hate you which I had rather You felt than make't my boast You sin against Obedience which you owe your father For The contract you pretend with that base wretch One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes With scraps o ' th ' court- it is no contract none And though it be allowed in meaner parties- Yet who than he more mean?- to knit their souls- On whom there is no more dependency But brats and beggary- in self figur'd knot Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by The consequence o ' th ' crown and must not foil The precious note of it with a base slave A hilding for a livery a squire 's cloth A pantler- not so eminent Profane fellow Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more But what thou art besides thou wert too base To be his groom Thou wert dignified enough Even to the point of envy if ' twere made Comparative for your virtues to be styl'd The under hangman of his kingdom and hated For being preferr'd so well The south fog rot him He never can meet more mischance than come To be but nam'd of thee His mean'st garment That ever hath but clipp'd his body is dearer In my respect than all the hairs above thee Were they all made such men How now Pisanio ' His garments ' Now the devil- To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently ' His garment ' I am sprited with a fool Frighted and ang'red worse Go bid my woman Search for a jewel that too casually Hath left mine arm It was thy master 's shrew me If I would lose it for a revenue Of any king 's in Europe I do think I saw't this morning confident I am Last night ' twas on mine arm I kiss'd it I hope it be not gone to tell my lord That I kiss aught but he ' Twill not be lost I hope so Go and search Exit PISANIO You have abus'd me ' His meanest garment ' Ay I said so sir If you will make ' t an action call witness to ' t. I will inform your father Your mother too She 's my good lady and will conceive I hope But the worst of me So I leave you sir To th ' worst of discontent Exit I 'll be reveng'd ' His mean'st garment ' Well Exit Fear it not sir I would I were so sure To win the King as I am bold her honour Will remain hers What means do you make to him Not any but abide the change of time Quake in the present winter 's state and wish That warmer days would come In these fear'd hopes I barely gratify your love they failing I must die much your debtor Your very goodness and your company O'erpays all I can do By this your king Hath heard of great Augustus Caius Lucius Will do 's commission throughly and I think He 'll grant the tribute send th ' arrearages Or look upon our Romans whose remembrance Is yet fresh in their grief I do believe Statist though I am none nor like to be That this will prove a war and you shall hear The legions now in Gallia sooner landed In our not fearing Britain than have tidings Of any penny tribute paid Our countrymen Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar Smil'd at their lack of skill but found their courage Worthy his frowning at Their discipline Now mingled with their courages will make known To their approvers they are people such That mend upon the world See Iachimo The swiftest harts have posted you by land And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails To make your vessel nimble Welcome sir I hope the briefness of your answer made The speediness of your return Your lady Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon And therewithal the best or let her beauty Look through a casement to allure false hearts And be false with them Here are letters for you Their tenour good I trust ' Tis very like Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court When you were there He was expected then But not approach'd All is well yet Sparkles this stone as it was wo nt or is't not Too dull for your good wearing If I have lost it I should have lost the worth of it in gold I 'll make a journey twice as far t ' enjoy A second night of such sweet shortness which Was mine in Britain for the ring is won The stone 's too hard to come by Not a whit Your lady being so easy Make not sir Your loss your sport I hope you know that we Must not continue friends Good sir we must If you keep covenant Had I not brought The knowledge of your mistress home I grant We were to question farther but I now Profess myself the winner of her honour Together with your ring and not the wronger Of her or you having proceeded but By both your wills If you can make't apparent That you have tasted her in bed my hand And ring is yours If not the foul opinion You had of her pure honour gains or loses Your sword or mine or masterless leaves both To who shall find them Sir my circumstances Being so near the truth as I will make them Must first induce you to believe- whose strength I will confirm with oath which I doubt not You 'll give me leave to spare when you shall find You need it not Proceed First her bedchamber Where I confess I slept not but profess Had that was well worth watching it was hang'd With tapestry of silk and silver the story Proud Cleopatra when she met her Roman And Cydnus swell'd above the banks or for The press of boats or pride A piece of work So bravely done so rich that it did strive In workmanship and value which I wonder'd Could be so rarely and exactly wrought Since the true life on't was- This is true And this you might have heard of here by me Or by some other More particulars Must justify my knowledge So they must Or do your honour injury The chimney Is south the chamber and the chimneypiece Chaste Dian bathing Never saw I figures So likely to report themselves The cutter Was as another nature dumb outwent her Motion and breath left out This is a thing Which you might from relation likewise reap Being as it is much spoke of The roof o ' th ' chamber With golden cherubins is fretted her andirons- I had forgot them- were two winking Cupids Of silver each on one foot standing nicely Depending on their brands This is her honour Let it be granted you have seen all this and praise Be given to your remembrance the description Of what is in her chamber nothing saves The wager you have laid Then if you can Shows the bracelet Be pale I beg but leave to air this jewel See And now ' tis up again It must be married To that your diamond I 'll keep them Jove Once more let me behold it Is it that Which I left with her Sir- I thank her- that She stripp'd it from her arm I see her yet Her pretty action did outsell her gift And yet enrich'd it too She gave it me and said She priz'd it once May be she pluck'd it of To send it me She writes so to you doth she O no no no ' tis true Here take this too Have patience sir And take your ring again ' tis not yet won It may be probable she lost it or Who knows if one her women being corrupted Hath stol'n it from her Very true And so I hope he came by't Back my ring Render to me some corporal sign about her More evident than this for this was stol'n By Jupiter I had it from her arm Hark you he swears by Jupiter he swears ' Tis true- nay keep the ring ' tis true I am sure She would not lose it Her attendants are All sworn and honourable- they induc'd to steal it And by a stranger No he hath enjoy'd her The cognizance of her incontinency Is this she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly There take thy hire and all the fiends of hell Divide themselves between you Sir be patient This is not strong enough to be believ'd Of one persuaded well of Never talk on't She hath been colted by him If you seek For further satisfying under her breast- Worthy the pressing- lies a mole right proud Of that most delicate lodging By my life I kiss'd it and it gave me present hunger To feed again though full You do remember This stain upon her Ay and it doth confirm Another stain as big as hell can hold Were there no more but it Will you hear more Spare your arithmetic never count the turns Once and a million I 'll be sworn- No swearing If you will swear you have not done't you lie And I will kill thee if thou dost deny Thou'st made me cuckold I 'll deny nothing O that I had her here to tear her limb meal I will go there and do't i ' th ' court before Her father I 'll do something- Exit Quite besides The government of patience You have won Let 's follow him and pervert the present wrath He hath against himself With all my heart Exeunt Is there no way for men to be but women Must be half workers We are all bastards And that most venerable man which I Did call my father was I know not where When I was stamp'd Some coiner with his tools Made me a counterfeit yet my mother seem'd The Dian of that time So doth my wife The nonpareil of this O vengeance vengeance Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd And pray'd me oft forbearance did it with A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't Might well have warm'd old Saturn that I thought her As chaste as unsunn'd snow O all the devils This yellow Iachimo in an hour- was't not Or less!- at first Perchance he spoke not but Like a full acorn'd boar a German one Cried ' O ' and mounted found no opposition But what he look'd for should oppose and she Should from encounter guard Could I find out The woman 's part in me For there 's no motion That tends to vice in man but I affirm It is the woman 's part Be it lying note it The woman 's flattering hers deceiving hers Lust and rank thoughts hers hers revenges hers Ambitions covetings change of prides disdain Nice longing slanders mutability All faults that man may name nay that hell knows Why hers in part or all but rather all For even to vice They are not constant but are changing still One vice but of a minute old for one Not half so old as that I 'll write against them Detest them curse them Yet ' tis greater skill In a true hate to pray they have their will The very devils can not plague them better Exit Now say what would Augustus Caesar with us When Julius Caesar- whose remembrance yet Lives in men 's eyes and will to ears and tongues Be theme and hearing ever- was in this Britain And conquer'd it Cassibelan thine uncle Famous in Caesar 's praises no whit less Than in his feats deserving it for him And his succession granted Rome a tribute Yearly three thousand pounds which by thee lately Is left untender'd And to kill the marvel Shall be so ever There be many Caesars Ere such another Julius Britain is A world by itself and we will nothing pay For wearing our own noses That opportunity Which then they had to take from 's to resume We have again Remember sir my liege The kings your ancestors together with The natural bravery of your isle which stands As Neptune 's park ribb'd and pal'd in With rocks unscalable and roaring waters With sands that will not bear your enemies ' boats But suck them up to th ' top mast A kind of conquest Caesar made here but made not here his brag Of ' came and saw and overcame ' With shame- The first that ever touch'd him- he was carried From off our coast twice beaten and his shipping- Poor ignorant baubles!- on our terrible seas Like egg shells mov'd upon their surges crack'd As easily ' gainst our rocks for joy whereof The fam'd Cassibelan who was once at point- O giglot fortune!- to master Caesar 's sword Made Lud 's Town with rejoicing fires bright And Britons strut with courage Come there 's no more tribute to be paid Our kingdom is stronger than it was at that time and as I said there is no moe such Caesars Other of them may have crook'd noses but to owe such straight arms none Son let your mother end We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as Cassibelan I do not say I am one but I have a hand Why tribute Why should we pay tribute If Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket or put the moon in his pocket we will pay him tribute for light else sir no more tribute pray you now You must know Till the injurious Romans did extort This tribute from us we were free Caesar 's ambition- Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch The sides o ' th ' world- against all colour here Did put the yoke upon 's which to shake of Becomes a warlike people whom we reckon Ourselves to be We do Say then to Caesar Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which Ordain'd our laws- whose use the sword of Caesar Hath too much mangled whose repair and franchise Shall by the power we hold be our good deed Though Rome be therefore angry Mulmutius made our laws Who was the first of Britain which did put His brows within a golden crown and call'd Himself a king I am sorry Cymbeline That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar- Caesar that hath moe kings his servants than Thyself domestic officers- thine enemy Receive it from me then war and confusion In Caesar 's name pronounce I ' gainst thee look For fury not to be resisted Thus defied I thank thee for myself Thou art welcome Caius Thy Caesar knighted me my youth I spent Much under him of him I gather'd honour Which he to seek of me again perforce Behoves me keep at utterance I am perfect That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for Their liberties are now in arms a precedent Which not to read would show the Britons cold So Caesar shall not find them Let proof speak His majesty bids you welcome Make pastime with us a day or two or longer If you seek us afterwards in other terms you shall find us in our salt water girdle If you beat us out of it it is yours if you fall in the adventure our crows shall fare the better for you and there 's an end So sir I know your master 's pleasure and he mine All the remain is welcome Exeunt How of adultery Wherefore write you not What monsters her accuse Leonatus O master what a strange infection Is fall'n into thy ear What false Italian- As poisonous tongu'd as handed- hath prevail'd On thy too ready hearing Disloyal No She 's punish'd for her truth and undergoes More goddess like than wife like such assaults As would take in some virtue O my master Thy mind to her is now as low as were Thy fortunes How that I should murder her Upon the love and truth and vows which I Have made to thy command I her Her blood If it be so to do good service never Let me be counted serviceable How look I That I should seem to lack humanity So much as this fact comes to Reads ' Do't The letter That I have sent her by her own command Shall give thee opportunity ' O damn'd paper Black as the ink that 's on thee Senseless bauble Art thou a fedary for this act and look'st So virgin like without Lo here she comes How now Pisanio Madam here is a letter from my lord Who thy lord That is my lord- Leonatus O learn'd indeed were that astronomer That knew the stars as I his characters- He 'd lay the future open You good gods Let what is here contain'd relish of love Of my lord 's health of his content yet not That we two are asunder- let that grieve him Some griefs are med'cinable that is one of them For it doth physic love- of his content All but in that Good wax thy leave Blest be You bees that make these locks of counsel Lovers And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike Though forfeiters you cast in prison yet You clasp young Cupid 's tables Good news gods One score ' twixt sun and sun Madam 's enough for you and too much too Why one that rode to 's execution man Could never go so slow I have heard of riding wagers Where horses have been nimbler than the sands That run i ' th ' clock 's behalf But this is fool'ry Go bid my woman feign a sickness say She 'll home to her father and provide me presently A riding suit no costlier than would fit A franklin 's huswife Madam you 're best consider I see before me man Nor here nor here Nor what ensues but have a fog in them That I can not look through Away I prithee Do as I bid thee There 's no more to say Accessible is none but Milford way Exeunt A goodly day not to keep house with such Whose roof 's as low as ours Stoop boys this gate Instructs you how t ' adore the heavens and bows you To a morning 's holy office The gates of monarchs Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through And keep their impious turbans on without Good morrow to the sun Hail thou fair heaven We house i ' th ' rock yet use thee not so hardly As prouder livers do Hail heaven Hail heaven Now for our mountain sport Up to yond hill Your legs are young I 'll tread these flats Consider When you above perceive me like a crow That it is place which lessens and sets off And you may then revolve what tales I have told you Of courts of princes of the tricks in war This service is not service so being done But being so allow'd To apprehend thus Draws us a profit from all things we see And often to our comfort shall we find The sharded beetle in a safer hold Than is the full wing'd eagle O this life Is nobler than attending for a check Richer than doing nothing for a bribe Prouder than rustling in unpaid for silk Such gain the cap of him that makes him fine Yet keeps his book uncross'd No life to ours Out of your proof you speak We poor unfledg'd Have never wing'd from view o ' th ' nest nor know not What air 's from home Haply this life is best If quiet life be best sweeter to you That have a sharper known well corresponding With your stiff age But unto us it is A cell of ignorance travelling abed A prison for a debtor that not dares To stride a limit What should we speak of When we are old as you When we shall hear The rain and wind beat dark December how In this our pinching cave shall we discourse The freezing hours away We have seen nothing We are beastly subtle as the fox for prey Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat Our valour is to chase what flies our cage We make a choir as doth the prison'd bird And sing our bondage freely How you speak Did you but know the city 's usuries And felt them knowingly- the art o ' th ' court As hard to leave as keep whose top to climb Is certain falling or so slipp'ry that The fear 's as bad as falling the toil o ' th ' war A pain that only seems to seek out danger I ' th'name of fame and honour which dies i ' th'search And hath as oft a sland'rous epitaph As record of fair act nay many times Doth ill deserve by doing well what 's worse- Must curtsy at the censure O boys this story The world may read in me my body 's mark'd With Roman swords and my report was once first with the best of note Cymbeline lov'd me And when a soldier was the theme my name Was not far off Then was I as a tree Whose boughs did bend with fruit but in one night A storm or robbery call it what you will Shook down my mellow hangings nay my leaves And left me bare to weather Uncertain favour My fault being nothing- as I have told you oft- But that two villains whose false oaths prevail'd Before my perfect honour swore to Cymbeline I was confederate with the Romans So Follow'd my banishment and this twenty years This rock and these demesnes have been my world Where I have liv'd at honest freedom paid More pious debts to heaven than in all The fore end of my time But up to th ' mountains This is not hunters ' language He that strikes The venison first shall be the lord o ' th ' feast To him the other two shall minister And we will fear no poison which attends In place of greater state I 'll meet you in the valleys Thou told'st me when we came from horse the place Was near at hand Ne'er long'd my mother so To see me first as I have now Pisanio Man Where is Posthumus What is in thy mind That makes thee stare thus Wherefore breaks that sigh From th ' inward of thee One but painted thus Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd Beyond self explication Put thyself Into a haviour of less fear ere wildness Vanquish my staider senses What 's the matter Why tender'st thou that paper to me with A look untender If't be summer news Smile to't before if winterly thou need'st But keep that count'nance still My husband 's hand That drug damn'd Italy hath out craftied him And he 's at some hard point Speak man thy tongue May take off some extremity which to read Would be even mortal to me Please you read And you shall find me wretched man a thing The most disdain'd of fortune Reads ' Thy mistress Pisanio hath play'd the strumpet in my bed the testimonies whereof lie bleeding in me I speak not out of weak surmises but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain as I expect my revenge That part thou Pisanio must act for me if thy faith be not tainted with the breach of hers Let thine own hands take away her life I shall give thee opportunity at Milford Haven she hath my letter for the purpose where if thou fear to strike and to make me certain it is done thou art the pander to her dishonour and equally to me disloyal ' What shall I need to draw my sword The paper Hath cut her throat already No ' tis slander Whose edge is sharper than the sword whose tongue Outvenoms all the worms of Nile whose breath Rides on the posting winds and doth belie All corners of the world Kings queens and states Maids matrons nay the secrets of the grave This viperous slander enters What cheer madam False to his bed What is it to be false To lie in watch there and to think on him To weep twixt clock and clock If sleep charge nature To break it with a fearful dream of him And cry myself awake That 's false to 's bed Is it Alas good lady I false Thy conscience witness Iachimo Thou didst accuse him of incontinency Thou then look'dst like a villain now methinks Thy favour 's good enough Some jay of Italy Whose mother was her painting hath betray'd him Poor I am stale a garment out of fashion And for I am richer than to hang by th ' walls I must be ripp'd To pieces with me O Men 's vows are women 's traitors All good seeming By thy revolt O husband shall be thought Put on for villainy not born where't grows But worn a bait for ladies Good madam hear me True honest men being heard like false Aeneas Were in his time thought false and Sinon 's weeping Did scandal many a holy tear took pity From most true wretchedness So thou Posthumus Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjur'd From thy great fail Come fellow be thou honest Do thou thy master 's bidding when thou seest him A little witness my obedience Look I draw the sword myself take it and hit The innocent mansion of my love my heart Fear not ' tis empty of all things but grief Thy master is not there who was indeed The riches of it Do his bidding strike Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause But now thou seem'st a coward Hence vile instrument Thou shalt not damn my hand Why I must die And if I do not by thy hand thou art No servant of thy master 's Against self slaughter There is a prohibition so divine That cravens my weak hand Come here 's my heart- Something 's afore't Soft soft we 'll no defence!- Obedient as the scabbard What is here The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus All turn'd to heresy Away away Corrupters of my faith you shall no more Be stomachers to my heart Thus may poor fools Believe false teachers though those that are betray'd Do feel the treason sharply yet the traitor Stands in worse case of woe And thou Posthumus That didst set up my disobedience ' gainst the King My father and make me put into contempt the suits Of princely fellows shalt hereafter find It is no act of common passage but A strain of rareness and I grieve myself To think when thou shalt be disedg'd by her That now thou tirest on how thy memory Will then be pang'd by me Prithee dispatch The lamp entreats the butcher Where 's thy knife Thou art too slow to do thy master 's bidding When I desire it too O gracious lady Since I receiv'd command to do this busines I have not slept one wink Do't and to bed then I 'll wake mine eyeballs first Wherefore then Didst undertake it Why hast thou abus'd So many miles with a pretence This place Mine action and thine own our horses ' labour The time inviting thee the perturb'd court For my being absent?- whereunto I never Purpose return Why hast thou gone so far To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand Th ' elected deer before thee But to win time To lose so bad employment in the which I have

the Severn Happiness He goes hence frowning but it honours us That we have given him cause ' Tis all the better Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it Lucius hath wrote already to the Emperor How it goes here It fits us therefore ripely Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness The pow'rs that he already hath in Gallia Will soon be drawn to head from whence he moves His war for Britain ' Tis not sleepy business But must be look'd to speedily and strongly Our expectation that it would be thus Hath made us forward But my gentle queen Where is our daughter She hath not appear'd Before the Roman nor to us hath tender'd The duty of the day She looks us like A thing more made of malice than of duty We have noted it Call her before us for We have been too slight in sufferance Exit a MESSENGER Royal sir Since the exile of Posthumus most retir'd Hath her life been the cure whereof my lord ' Tis time must do Beseech your Majesty Forbear sharp speeches to her she 's a lady So tender of rebukes that words are strokes And strokes death to her Where is she sir How Can her contempt be answer'd Please you sir Her chambers are all lock'd and there 's no answer That will be given to th ' loud of noise we make My lord when last I went to visit her She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity She should that duty leave unpaid to you Which daily she was bound to proffer This She wish'd me to make known but our great court Made me to blame in memory Her doors lock'd Not seen of late Grant heavens that which I fear Prove false Exit Son I say follow

by swallowing that for he believes It is a thing most precious But for her Where is she gone Haply despair hath seiz'd her Or wing'd with fervour of her love she 's flown To her desir'd Posthumus Gone she is To death or to dishonour and my end Can make good use of either She being down I have the placing of the British crown ' Tis certain she is fled Go in and cheer the King He rages none Dare come about him All the better May This night forestall him of the coming day Exit I love and hate her for she 's fair and royal And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite Than lady ladies woman From every one The best she hath and she of all compounded Outsells them all I love her therefore but Disdaining me and throwing favours on The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment That what 's else rare is chok'd and in that point I will conclude to hate her nay indeed To be reveng'd upon her For when fools Shall- O good my lord Where is thy lady or by Jupiter- I will not ask again Close villain I 'll have this secret from thy heart or rip Thy heart to find it Is she with Posthumus From whose so many weights of baseness can not A dram of worth be drawn Alas my lord How can she be with him When was she miss'd He is in Rome Where is she sir Come nearer No farther halting Satisfy me home What is become of her O my all worthy lord All worthy villain Discover where thy mistress is at once

letter Let 's see't I will pursue her Even to Augustus ' throne Aside Or this or perish She 's far enough and what he learns by this May prove his travel not her danger Humh Aside I 'll write to my lord she 's dead O Imogen Safe mayst thou wander safe return again Sirrah is this letter true Sir as I think It is Posthumus ' hand I know't Sirrah if thou wouldst not be a villain but do me true service undergo those employments wherein I should have cause to use thee with a serious industry- that is what villainy soe'er I bid thee do to perform it directly and truly- I would think thee an honest man thou shouldst neither want my means for thy relief nor my voice for thy preferment Well my good lord Wilt thou serve me For since patiently and constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of that beggar Posthumus thou canst not in the course of gratitude but be a diligent follower of mine Wilt thou serve me Sir I will Give me thy hand here 's my purse Hast any of thy late master 's garments in thy possession I have my lord at my lodging the same suit he wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress The first service thou dost me fetch that suit hither Let it be thy first service go I shall my lord Exit Meet thee at Milford Haven I forgot to ask him one thing I 'll remember't anon Even there thou villain Posthumus will I kill thee I would these garments were come She said upon a time- the bitterness of it I now belch from my heart- that she held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect than my noble and natural person together with the adornment of my qualities With that suit upon my back will I ravish her first kill him and in her eyes There shall she see my valour which will then be a torment to her contempt He on the ground my speech of insultment ended on his dead body and when my lust hath dined- which as I say to vex her I will execute in the clothes that she so prais'd- to the court I 'll knock her back foot her home again She hath despis'd me rejoicingly and I 'll be merry in my revenge Ay my noble lord How long is't since she went to Milford Haven She can scarce be there yet Bring this apparel to my chamber that is the second thing that I have commanded thee The third is that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design Be but duteous and true preferment shall tender itself to thee My revenge is now at Milford would I had wings to follow it Come and be true Exit Thou bid'st me to my loss for true to thee Were to prove false which I will never be To him that is most true To Milford go And find not her whom thou pursuest Flow flow You heavenly blessings on her This fool 's speed Be cross'd with slowness Labour be his meed Exit I see a man 's life is a tedious one I have tir'd myself and for two nights together Have made the ground my bed I should be sick But that my resolution helps me Milford When from the mountain top Pisanio show'd thee Thou wast within a ken O Jove I think Foundations fly the wretched such I mean Where they should be reliev'd Two beggars told me I could not miss my way Will poor folks lie That have afflictions on them knowing ' tis A punishment or trial Yes no wonder When rich ones scarce tell true To lapse in fulness Is sorer than to lie for need and falsehood Is worse in kings than beggars My dear lord Thou art one o ' th ' false ones Now I think on thee My hunger 's gone but even before I was At point to sink for food But what is this Here is a path to't ' tis some savage hold I were best not call I dare not call Yet famine Ere clean it o'erthrow nature makes it valiant Plenty and peace breeds cowards hardness ever Of hardiness is mother Ho who 's here If anything that 's civil speak if savage Take or lend Ho No answer Then I 'll enter Best draw my sword and

Discourse is heavy fasting when we have supp'd We 'll mannerly demand thee of thy story So far as thou wilt speak it Pray draw near The night to th ' owl and morn to th ' lark less welcome Thanks sir I pray draw near Exeunt This is the tenour of the Emperor 's writ That since the common men are now in action ' Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians And that the legions now in Gallia are Full weak to undertake our wars against The fall'n off Britons that we do incite The gentry to this business He creates Lucius proconsul and to you the tribunes For this immediate levy he commands His absolute commission Long live Caesar Is Lucius general of the forces Ay Remaining now in Gallia With those legions Which I have spoke of whereunto your levy Must be supplyant The words of your commission Will tie you to the numbers and the time Of their dispatch We will discharge our duty Exeunt I am near to th ' place where they should meet if Pisanio have mapp'd it truly How fit his garments serve me Why should his mistress who was made by him that made the tailor not be fit too The rather- saving reverence of the word- for ' tis said a woman 's fitness comes by fits Therein I must play the workman I dare speak it to myself for it is not vain glory for a man and his glass to confer in his own chamber- I mean the lines of my body are as well drawn as his no less young more strong not beneath him in fortunes beyond him in the advantage of the time above him in birth alike conversant in general services and more remarkable in single oppositions Yet this imperceiverant thing loves him in my despite What mortality is Posthumus thy head which now is growing upon thy shoulders shall within this hour be off thy mistress enforced thy garments cut to pieces before her face and all this done spurn her home to her father who may haply be a little angry for my so rough usage but my mother having power of his testiness shall turn all into my commendations My horse is tied up safe Out sword and to a

How angel like he sings But his neat cookery He cut our roots in characters And sauc'd our broths as Juno had been sick And he her dieter Nobly he yokes A smiling with a sigh as if the sigh Was that it was for not being such a smile The smile mocking the sigh that it would fly From so divine a temple to commix With winds that sailors rail at I do note That grief and patience rooted in him both Mingle their spurs together Grow patience And let the stinking elder grief untwine His perishing root with the increasing vine It is great morning Come away Who 's there I can not find those runagates that villain Hath mock'd me I am faint Those runagates Means he not us I partly know him ' tis Cloten the son o ' th ' Queen I fear some ambush I saw him not these many years and yet I know ' tis he

villain mountaineers I have heard of such What slave art thou A thing More slavish did I ne'er than answering ' A slave ' without a knock Thou art a robber A law breaker a villain Yield thee thief To who To thee What art thou Have not I An arm as big as thine a heart as big Thy words I grant are bigger for I wear not My dagger in my mouth Say what thou art Why I should yield to thee Thou villain base Know'st me not by my clothes No nor thy tailor rascal Who is thy grandfather he made those clothes Which as it seems make thee Thou precious varlet My tailor made them not Hence then and thank The man that gave them thee Thou art some fool I am loath to beat thee Thou injurious thief Hear but my name and tremble What 's thy name Cloten thou villain Cloten thou double villain be thy name I can not tremble at it Were it toad or adder spider ' Twould move me sooner To thy further fear Nay to thy mere confusion thou shalt know I am son to th ' Queen I 'm sorry for't not seeming So worthy as thy birth Art not afeard Those that I reverence those I fear- the wise At fools I laugh not fear them Die the death When I have slain thee with my proper hand I 'll follow those that even now fled hence And on the gates of Lud 's Town set your heads Yield rustic mountaineer Exeunt fighting No company 's abroad None in the world you did mistake him sure I can not tell long is it since I saw him But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour Which then he wore the snatches in his voice And burst of speaking were as his I am absolute ' Twas very Cloten In this place we left them I wish my brother make good time with him You say he is so fell Being scarce made up I mean to man he had not apprehension Or roaring terrors for defect of judgment Is oft the cease of fear This Cloten was a fool an empty purse There was no money in't Not Hercules Could have knock'd out his brains for he had none Yet I not doing this the fool had borne My head as I do his What hast thou done I am perfect what cut off one Cloten 's head Son to the Queen after his own report Who call'd me traitor mountaineer and swore With his own single hand he 'd take us in Displace our heads where- thank the gods!- they grow And set them on Lud 's Town We are all undone Why worthy father what have we to lose But that he swore to take our lives The law Protects not us then why should we be tender To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us Play judge and executioner all himself For we do fear the law What company Discover you abroad No single soul Can we set eye on but in an safe reason He must have some attendants Though his humour Was nothing but mutation- ay and that From one bad thing to worse- not frenzy not Absolute madness could so far have rav'd To bring him here alone Although perhaps It may be heard at court that such as we Cave here hunt here are outlaws and in time May make some stronger head- the which he hearing As it is like him might break out and swear He 'd fetch us in yet is't not probable To come alone either he so undertaking Or they so suffering Then on good ground we fear If we do fear this body hath a tail More perilous than the head Let ordinance Come as the gods foresay it Howsoe'er My brother hath done well I had no mind To hunt this day the boy Fidele 's sickness Did make my way long forth With his own sword Which he did wave against my throat I have ta'en His head from him I 'll throw't into the creek Behind our rock and let it to the sea And tell the fishes he 's the Queen 's son Cloten That 's all I reck Exit I fear'twill be reveng'd Would Polydore

revenges That possible strength might meet would seek us through And put us to our answer Well ' tis done We 'll hunt no more to day nor seek for danger Where there 's no profit I prithee to our rock You and Fidele play the cooks I 'll stay Till hasty Polydore return and bring him To dinner presently Poor sick Fidele I 'll willingly to him to gain his colour I 'd let a parish of such Cloten 's blood And praise myself for charity Exit O thou goddess Thou divine Nature thou thyself thou blazon'st In these two princely boys They are as gentle As zephyrs blowing below the violet Not wagging his sweet head and yet as rough Their royal blood enchaf'd as the rud'st wind That by the top doth take the mountain pine And make him stoop to th ' vale ' Tis wonder That an invisible instinct should frame them To royalty unlearn'd honour untaught Civility not seen from other valour That wildly grows in them but yields a crop As if it had been sow'd Yet still it 's strange What Cloten 's being here to us portends Or what his death will bring us Where 's my brother I have sent Cloten 's clotpoll down the stream In embassy to his mother his body 's hostage For his return Solemn music My ingenious instrument Hark Polydore it sounds But what occasion Hath Cadwal now to give it motion Hark Is he at home He went hence even now What does he mean Since death of my dear'st mother It did not speak before All solemn things Should answer solemn accidents The matter Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys Is jollity for apes and grief for boys Is Cadwal mad Look here he comes And brings the dire occasion in his arms Of what we blame him for The bird is dead That we have made so much on I had rather Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty To have turn'd my leaping time into a crutch Than have seen this O sweetest fairest lily My brother wears thee not the one half so well As when thou grew'st thyself O melancholy Who ever yet could sound thy bottom find The ooze to show what coast thy sluggish crare Might'st easiliest harbour in Thou blessed thing Jove knows what man thou mightst have made but I Thou diedst a most rare boy of melancholy How found you him Stark as you see Thus smiling as some fly had tickled slumber Not as death 's dart being laugh'd at his right cheek Reposing on a cushion Where O ' th ' floor His arms thus leagu'd I thought he slept and put My clouted brogues from off my feet whose rudeness Answer'd my steps too loud Why he but sleeps If he be gone he 'll make his grave a bed With female fairies will his tomb be haunted And worms will not come to thee With fairest flowers Whilst summer lasts and I live here Fidele I 'll sweeten thy sad grave Thou shalt not lack The flower that 's like thy face pale primrose nor The azur'd hare bell like thy veins no nor The leaf of eglantine whom not to slander Out sweet'ned not thy breath The ruddock would With charitable bill- O bill sore shaming Those rich left heirs that let their fathers lie Without a monument!- bring thee all this Yea and furr'd moss besides when flow'rs are none To winter ground thy corse- Prithee have done And do not play in wench like words with that Which is so serious Let us bury him And not protract with admiration what Is now due debt To th ' grave Say where shall 's lay him By good Euriphile our mother Be't so And let us Polydore though now our voices Have got the mannish crack sing him to th ' ground As once to our mother use like note and words Save that Euriphile must be Fidele Cadwal I can not sing I 'll weep and word it with thee For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse Than priests and fanes that lie We 'll speak it then Great griefs I see med'cine the less for Cloten Is quite forgot He was a queen 's son boys And though he came our enemy remember He was paid for that Though mean and mighty rotting Together have one dust yet reverence- That angel of the world- doth make distinction Of place ' tween high and low Our foe was princely And though you took his life as being our foe Yet bury him as a prince Pray you fetch him hither Thersites ' body is as good as Ajax ' When neither are alive If you 'll go fetch him We 'll say our song the whilst Brother begin Nay Cadwal we must lay his head to th ' East My father hath a reason for't ' Tis true Come on then and remove him So Begin Fear no more the heat o ' th ' sun Fear no more the frown o ' th ' great Fear no more the lightning flash Nor th ' all dreaded thunder stone Fear not slander censure rash Thou hast finish'd joy and moan All lovers young all lovers must No exorciser harm thee Nor no witchcraft charm thee Ghost unlaid forbear thee Nothing ill come near thee Quiet consummation have We have done our obsequies Come lay him down Here 's a few flowers but 'bout midnight more The herbs that have on them cold dew o ' th ' night Are strewings fit'st for graves Upon their faces You were as flow'rs now wither'd Even so These herblets shall which we upon you strew Come on away Apart upon our knees The ground that gave them first has them again Their pleasures here are past so is their pain Awaking Yes sir to Milford Haven Which is the way I thank you By yond bush Pray how far thither ' Ods pittikins can it be six mile yet I have gone all night Faith I 'll lie down and sleep But soft no bedfellow O gods and goddesses To them the legions garrison'd in Gallia After your will have cross'd the sea attending You here at Milford Haven with your ships They are in readiness But what from Rome The Senate hath stirr'd up the confiners And gentlemen of Italy most willing spirits That promise noble service and they come Under the conduct of bold Iachimo Sienna 's brother When expect you them With the next benefit o ' th ' wind This forwardness Makes our hopes fair Command our present numbers Be muster'd bid the captains look to't Now sir What have you dream'd of late of this war 's purpose Last night the very gods show'd me a vision- I fast and pray'd for their intelligence- thus I saw Jove 's bird the Roman eagle wing'd From the spongy south to this part of the west There vanish'd in the sunbeams which portends Unless my sins abuse my divination Success to th ' Roman host Dream often so And never false Soft ho what trunk is here Without his top The ruin speaks that sometime It was a worthy building How a page Or dead or sleeping on him But dead rather For nature doth abhor to make his bed With the defunct or sleep upon the dead Let 's see the boy 's face He 's alive my lord He 'll then instruct us of this body Young one Inform us of thy fortunes for it seems They crave to be demanded Who is this Thou mak'st thy bloody pillow Or who was he That otherwise than noble nature did Hath alter'd that good picture What 's thy interest In this sad wreck How came't Who is't What art thou I am nothing or if not Nothing to be were better This was my master A very valiant Briton and a good That here by mountaineers lies slain Alas There is no more such masters I may wander From east to occident cry out for service Try many all good serve truly never Find such another master ' Lack good youth Thou mov'st no less with thy complaining than Thy master in bleeding Say his name good friend Richard du Champ Aside If I do lie and do No harm by it though the gods hear I hope They 'll pardon it.- Say you sir Thy name Fidele sir Thou dost approve thyself the very same Thy name well fits thy faith thy faith thy name Wilt take thy chance with me I will not say Thou shalt be so well master'd but be sure No less belov'd The Roman Emperor 's letters Sent by a consul to me should not sooner Than thine own worth prefer thee Go with me I 'll follow sir But first an't please the gods I 'll hide my master from the flies as deep As these poor pickaxes can dig and when With wild wood leaves and weeds I ha ' strew'd his grave And on it said a century of prayers Such as I can twice o'er I 'll weep and sigh And leaving so his service follow you So please you entertain me Ay good youth And rather father thee than master thee My friends The boy hath taught us manly duties let us Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can And make him with our pikes and partisans A grave Come arm him Boy he is preferr'd By thee to us and he shall be interr'd As soldiers can Be cheerful wipe thine eyes Some falls are means the happier to arise Exeunt Again and bring me word how ' tis with her Sir my life is yours I humbly set it at your will but for my mistress I nothing know where she remains why gone Nor when she purposes return Beseech your Highness Hold me your loyal servant Good my liege The day that she was missing he was here I dare be bound he 's true and shall perform All parts of his subjection loyally For Cloten There wants no diligence in seeking him And will no doubt be found The time is troublesome To PISANIO We 'll slip you for a season but our jealousy Does yet depend So please your Majesty The Roman legions all from Gallia drawn Are landed on your coast with a supply Of Roman gentlemen by the Senate sent Now for the counsel of my son and queen I am amaz'd with matter Good my liege Your preparation can affront no less Than what you hear of Come more for more you 're ready The want is but to put those pow'rs in motion That long to move I thank you Let 's withdraw And meet the time as it seeks us We fear not What can from Italy annoy us but We grieve at chances here Away Exeunt all but PISANIO I heard no letter from my master since I wrote him Imogen was slain ' Tis strange Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise To yield me often tidings Neither know What is betid to Cloten but remain Perplex'd in all The heavens still must work Wherein I am false I am honest not true to be true These present wars shall find I love my country Even to the note o ' th ' King or I 'll fall in them All other doubts by time let them be clear'd Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd Exit The noise is round about us Let us from it What pleasure sir find we in life to lock it From action and adventure Nay what hope Have we in hiding us This way the Romans Must or for Britons slay us or receive us For barbarous and unnatural revolts During their use and slay us after Sons We 'll higher to the mountains there secure us To the King 's party there 's no going Newness Of Cloten 's death- we being not known not muster'd Among the bands may drive us to a render Where we have liv'd and so extort from 's that Which we have done whose answer would be death Drawn on with torture This is sir a doubt In such a time nothing becoming you Nor satisfying us It is not likely That when they hear the Roman horses neigh Behold their quarter'd fires have both their eyes And ears so cloy'd importantly as now That they will waste their time upon our note To know from whence we are O I am known Of many in the army Many years Though Cloten then but young you see not wore him From my remembrance And besides the King Hath not deserv'd my service nor your loves Who find in my exile the want of breeding The certainty of this hard life aye hopeless To have the courtesy your cradle promis'd But to be still hot summer 's tanlings and The shrinking slaves of winter Than be so Better to cease to be Pray sir to th ' army I and my brother are not known yourself So out of thought and thereto so o'ergrown Can not be questioned By this sun that shines I 'll thither What thing is't that I never Did see man die scarce ever look'd on blood But that of coward hares hot goats and venison Never bestrid a horse save one that had A rider like myself who ne'er wore rowel Nor iron on his heel I am asham'd To look upon the holy sun to have The benefit of his blest beams remaining So long a poor unknown By heavens I 'll go If you will bless me sir and give me leave I 'll take the better care but if you will not The hazard therefore due fall on me by The hands of Romans So say I. Amen No reason I since of your lives you set So slight a valuation should reserve My crack'd one to more care Have with you boys If in your country wars you chance to die That is my bed too lads and there I 'll lie Lead lead Aside The time seems long their blood thinks scorn Till it fly out and show them princes born Exeunt Yea bloody cloth I 'll keep thee for I wish'd Thou shouldst be colour'd thus You married ones If each of you should take this course how many Must murder wives much better than themselves For wrying but a little O Pisanio Every good servant does not all commands No bond but to do just ones Gods if you Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults I never Had liv'd to put on this so had you saved The noble Imogen to repent and struck Me wretch more worth your vengeance But

is your own Do your best wills And make me blest to obey I am brought hither Among th ' Italian gentry and to fight Against my lady 's kingdom ' Tis enough That Britain I have kill'd thy mistress peace I 'll give no wound to thee Therefore good heavens Hear patiently my purpose I 'll disrobe me Of these Italian weeds and suit myself As does a Britain peasant So I 'll fight Against the part I come with so I 'll die For thee O Imogen even for whom my life Is every breath a death And thus unknown Pitied nor hated to the face of peril Myself I 'll dedicate Let me make men know More valour in me than my habits show Gods put the strength o ' th ' Leonati in me To shame the guise o ' th ' world I will begin The fashion- less without and more within Exit The heaviness and guilt within my

Through a strait lane- the enemy full hearted Lolling the tongue with slaught'ring having work More plentiful than tools to do't struck down Some mortally some slightly touch'd some falling Merely through fear that the strait pass was damm'd With dead men hurt behind and cowards living To die with length'ned shame Where was this lane Close by the battle ditch'd and wall'd with turf Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier- An honest one I warrant who deserv'd So long a breeding as his white beard came to In doing this for 's country Athwart the lane He with two striplings- lads more like to run The country base than to commit such slaughter With faces fit for masks or rather fairer Than those for preservation cas'd or shame- Made good the passage cried to those that fled ' Our Britain

effects So follow to be most unlike our courtiers As good as promise Come sir are you ready for death Over roasted rather ready long ago Hanging is the word sir if you be ready for that you are well cook'd So if I prove a good repast to the spectators the dish pays the shot A heavy reckoning for you sir But the comfort is you shall be called to no more payments fear no more tavern bills which are often the sadness of parting as the procuring of mirth You come in faint for want of meat depart reeling with too much drink sorry that you have paid too much and sorry that you are paid too much purse and brain both empty the brain the heavier for being too light the purse too light being drawn of heaviness O of this contradiction you shall now be quit O the charity of a penny cord It sums up thousands in a trice You have no true debitor and creditor but it of what 's past is and to come the discharge Your neck sir is pen book and counters so the acquittance follows I am merrier to die

barren the swell'd boast Of him that best could speak for feature laming The shrine of Venus or straight pight Minerva Postures beyond brief nature for condition A shop of all the qualities that man Loves woman for besides that hook of wiving Fairness which strikes the eye- I stand on fire Come to the matter All too soon I shall Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly This Posthumus Most like a noble lord in love and one That had a royal lover took his hint And not dispraising whom we prais'd- therein He was as calm as virtue- he began His mistress ' picture which by his tongue being made And then

difference ' Twixt amorous and villainous Being thus quench'd Of hope not longing mine Italian brain Gan in your duller Britain operate Most vilely for my vantage excellent And to be brief my practice so prevail'd That I return'd with simular proof enough To make the noble Leonatus mad By wounding his belief in her renown With tokens thus and thus averring notes Of chamber hanging pictures this her bracelet- O cunning how I got it!- nay some marks Of secret on her person that he could not But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd I having ta'en the forfeit Whereupon- Methinks I see him now-

two worlds by't O my gentle brothers Have we thus met O never say hereafter But I am truest speaker You call'd me brother When I was but your sister I you brothers When we were so indeed Did you e'er meet Ay my good lord And at first meeting lov'd Continu'd so until we thought he died By the Queen 's dram she swallow'd O rare instinct When shall I hear all through This fierce abridgment Hath to it circumstantial branches which Distinction should be rich in Where how liv'd you And when came you to serve our Roman captive How parted with your brothers how first met them Why fled you from the court and whither These And your three motives to the battle with I know not how much more should be demanded And all the other by dependences From chance to chance but nor the time nor place Will

others better Nobly doom'd We 'll learn our freeness of a son in law Pardon 's the word to all You holp us sir As you did mean indeed to be our brother Joy'd are we that you are Your servant Princes Good my lord of Rome Call forth your soothsayer As I slept methought Great Jupiter upon his eagle back'd Appear'd to me with other spritely shows Of mine own kindred When I wak'd I found This label on

who but Rumour who but only I Make fearful musters and prepar'd defence Whiles the big year swoln with some other grief Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war And no such matter Rumour is a pipe Blown by surmises jealousies conjectures And of so easy and so plain a stop That the blunt monster with uncounted heads The still discordant wav'ring multitude Can play upon it But what need I thus My well known body to anatomize Among my household Why is Rumour here I run before King Harry 's victory Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops

The times are wild contention like a horse Full of high feeding madly hath broke loose And bears down all before him Noble Earl I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury Good an God will As good as heart can wish The King is almost wounded to the death And in the fortune of my lord your son Prince Harry slain outright and both the Blunts Kill'd by the hand of Douglas young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field And Harry Monmouth 's brawn the hulk Sir John Is prisoner to your son O such a day So fought so followed and so fairly won Came not till now to dignify the times Since Cxsar 's fortunes How is this deriv'd Saw you the field Came you from Shrewsbury I spake with one my lord that came from thence A gentleman well bred and of good name That freely rend'red me these news for true Here comes my servant Travers whom I sent On Tuesday last to listen after news My lord I over rode him on the way And he is furnish'd with no certainties More than he haply may retail from me Now Travers what good tidings comes with you My lord Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back With joyful tidings and being better hors'd Out rode me After him came spurring hard A gentleman almost forspent with speed That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse He ask'd the way to Chester and of him I did demand what news from Shrewsbury He told me that rebellion had bad luck And that young Harry Percy 's spur was cold With that he gave his able horse the head And bending forward struck his armed heels Against the panting sides of his poor jade Up to the rowel head and starting so He seem'd in running to devour the way Staying no longer question Ha Again Said he young Harry Percy 's spur was cold Of Hotspur Coldspur that rebellion Had met ill luck My lord I 'll tell you what If my young lord your son have not the day Upon mine honour for a silken point I 'll give my barony Never talk of it Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers Give then such instances of loss Who- he He was some hilding fellow that had stol'n The horse he rode on and upon my life Spoke at a venture Look here comes more news Yea this man 's brow like to a title leaf Foretells the nature of a tragic volume So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood Hath left a witness'd usurpation Say Morton didst thou come from Shrewsbury I ran from Shrewsbury my noble lord Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask To fright our party How doth my son and brother Thou tremblest and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand Even such a man so faint so spiritless So dull so dread in look so woe begone Drew Priam 's curtain in the dead of night And would have told him half his Troy was burnt But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue And I my Percy 's death ere thou report'st it This thou wouldst say ' Your son did thus and thus Your brother thus so fought the noble Douglas'- Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds But in the end to stop my ear indeed Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise Ending with ' Brother son and all are dead ' Douglas is living and your brother yet But for my lord your son- Why he is dead See what a ready tongue suspicion hath He that but fears the thing he would not know Hath by instinct knowledge from others ' eyes That what he fear'd is chanced Yet speak Morton Tell thou an earl his divination lies And I will take it as a sweet disgrace And make thee rich for doing me such wrong You are too great to be by me gainsaid Your spirit is too true your fears too certain Yet for all this say not that Percy 's dead I see a strange confession in thine eye Thou shak'st thy head and hold'st it fear or sin To speak a truth If he be slain say so The tongue offends not that reports his death And he doth sin that doth belie the dead Not he which says the dead is not alive Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news Hath but a losing office and his tongue Sounds ever after as a sullen bell Rememb'red tolling a departing friend I can not think my lord your son is dead I am sorry I should force you to believe That which I would to God I had not seen But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state Rend'ring faint quittance wearied and out breath'd To Harry Monmouth whose swift wrath beat down The never daunted Percy to the earth From whence with life he never more sprung up In few his death- whose spirit lent a fire Even to the dullest peasant in his camp- Being bruited once took fire and heat away From the best temper'd courage in his troops For from his metal was his party steeled Which once in him abated an the rest Turn'd on themselves like dull and heavy lead And as the thing that 's heavy in itself Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed So did our men heavy in Hotspur 's loss Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim Than did our soldiers aiming at their safety Fly from the field Then was that noble Worcester Too soon ta'en prisoner and that furious Scot The bloody Douglas whose well labouring sword Had three times slain th ' appearance of the King Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame Of those that turn'd their backs and in his flight Stumbling in fear was took The sum of all Is that the King hath won and hath sent out A speedy power to encounter you my lord Under the conduct of young Lancaster And Westmoreland This is the news at full For this I shall have time enough to mourn In poison there is physic and these news Having been well that would have made me sick Being sick have in some measure made me well And as the wretch whose fever weak'ned joints Like strengthless hinges buckle under life Impatient of his fit breaks like a fire Out of his keeper 's arms even so my limbs Weak'ned with grief being now enrag'd with grief Are thrice themselves Hence therefore thou nice crutch A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel Must glove this hand and hence thou sickly coif Thou art a guard too wanton for the head Which princes flesh'd with conquest aim to hit Now bind my brows with iron and approach The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring To frown upon th ' enrag'd Northumberland Let heaven kiss earth Now let not Nature 's hand Keep the wild flood confin'd Let order die And let this world no longer be a stage To feed contention in a ling'ring act But let one spirit of the first born Cain Reign in all bosoms that each heart being set On bloody courses the rude scene may end And darkness be the burier of the dead This strained passion doth you wrong my lord Sweet Earl divorce not wisdom from your honour The lives of all your loving complices Lean on your health the which if you give o'er To stormy passion must perforce decay You cast th ' event of war my noble lord And summ'd the account of chance before you said ' Let us make head ' It was your pre surmise That in the dole of blows your son might drop You knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge More likely to fall in than to get o'er You were advis'd his flesh was capable Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit Would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd Yet did you say ' Go forth ' and none of this Though strongly apprehended could restrain The stiff borne action What hath then befall'n Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth More than that being which was like to be We all that are engaged to this loss Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas That if we wrought out life ' twas ten to one And yet we ventur'd for the gain propos'd Chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd And since we are o'erset venture again Come we will put forth body and goods ' Tis more than time And my most noble lord I hear for certain and dare speak the truth The gentle Archbishop of York is up With well appointed pow'rs He is a man Who with a double surety binds his followers My lord your son had only but the corpse But shadows and the shows of men to fight For that same word ' rebellion ' did divide The action of their bodies from their souls And they did fight with queasiness constrain'd As men drink potions that their weapons only Seem'd on our side but for their spirits and souls This word ' rebellion'- it had froze them up As fish are in a pond But now the Bishop Turns insurrection to religion Suppos'd sincere and holy in his thoughts He 's follow'd both with body and with mind And doth enlarge his rising with the blood Of fair King Richard scrap'd from Pomfret stones Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke And more and less do flock to follow him I knew of this before but to speak truth This present grief had wip'd it from my mind Go in with me and counsel every man The aptest way for safety and revenge Get posts and letters and make friends with speed- Never so few and never yet more need Exeunt Sirrah you giant what says the doctor to my water He said sir the water itself was a good healthy water but for the party that owed it he might have moe diseases than he knew for Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me The brain of this foolish compounded clay man is not able to invent anything that intends to laughter more than I invent or is invented on me I am not only witty in myself but the cause that wit is in other men I do here walk before thee like a sow that hath overwhelm'd all her litter but one If the Prince put thee into my service for any other reason than to set me off why then I have no judgment Thou whoreson mandrake thou art fitter to be worn in my cap than to wait at my heels I was never mann'd with an agate till now but I will inset you neither in gold nor silver but in vile apparel and send you back again to your master for a jewel- the juvenal the Prince your master whose chin is not yet fledge I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one off his cheek and yet he will not stick to say his face is a face royal God may finish it when he will ' tis not a hair amiss yet He may keep it still at a face royal for a barber shall never earn sixpence out of it and yet he 'll be crowing as if he had writ man ever since his father was a bachelor He may keep his own grace but he 's almost out of mine I can assure him What said Master Dommelton about the satin for my short cloak and my slops He said sir you should procure him better assurance than Bardolph He would not take his band and yours he liked not the security Let him be damn'd like the Glutton pray God his tongue be hotter A whoreson Achitophel A rascal yea forsooth knave to bear a gentleman in hand and then stand upon security The whoreson smooth pates do now wear nothing but high shoes and bunches of keys at their girdles and if a man is through with them in honest taking up then they must stand upon security I had as lief they would put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with security I look'd ' a should have sent me two and twenty yards of satin as I am a true knight and he sends me security Well he may sleep in security for he hath the horn of abundance and the lightness of his wife shines through it and yet can not he see though he have his own lanthorn to light him Where 's Bardolph He 's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship horse I bought him in Paul 's and he 'll buy me a horse in Smithfield An I could get me but a wife in the stews I were mann'd hors'd and wiv'd Sir here comes the nobleman that committed the Prince for striking him about Bardolph Wait close I will not see him What 's he that goes there Falstaff an't please your lordship He that was in question for the robb'ry He my lord but he hath since done good service at Shrewsbury and as I hear is now going with some charge to the Lord John of Lancaster What to York Call him back again Sir John Falstaff Boy tell him I am deaf You must speak louder my master is deaf I am sure he is to the hearing of anything good Go pluck him by the elbow I must speak with him Sir John What a young knave and begging Is there not wars Is there not employment Doth not the King lack subjects Do not the rebels need soldiers Though it be a shame to be on any side but one it is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell how to make it You mistake me sir Why sir did I say you were an honest man Setting my knighthood and my soldiership aside I had lied in my throat if I had said so I pray you sir then set your knighthood and your soldiership aside and give me leave to tell you you in your throat if you say I am any other than an honest man I give thee leave to tell me so I lay aside that which grows to me If thou get'st any leave of me hang me if thou tak'st leave thou wert better be hang'd You hunt counter Hence Avaunt Sir my lord would speak with you Sir John Falstaff a word with you My good lord God give your lordship good time of day I am glad to see your lordship abroad I heard say your lordship was sick I hope your lordship goes abroad by advice Your lordship though not clean past your youth hath yet some smack of age in you some relish of the saltness of time and I most humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverend care of your health Sir John I sent for you before your expedition to Shrewsbury An't please your lordship I hear his Majesty is return'd with some discomfort from Wales I talk not of his Majesty You would not come when I sent for you And I hear moreover his Highness is fall'n into this same whoreson apoplexy Well God mend him I pray you let me speak with you This apoplexy as I take it is a kind of lethargy an't please your lordship a kind of sleeping in the blood a whoreson tingling What tell you me of it Be it as it is It hath it original from much grief from study and perturbation of the brain I have read the cause of his effects in Galen it is a kind of deafness I think you are fall'n into the disease for you hear not what I say to you Very well my lord very well Rather an't please you it is the disease of not listening the malady of not marking that I am troubled withal To punish you by the heels would amend the attention of your ears and I care not if I do become your physician I am as poor as Job my lord but not so patient Your lordship may minister the potion of imprisonment to me in respect of poverty but how I should be your patient to follow your prescriptions the wise may make some dram of a scruple or indeed a scruple itself I sent for you when there were matters against you for your life to come speak with me As I was then advis'd by my learned counsel in the laws of this land service I did not come Well the truth is Sir John you live in great infamy He that buckles himself in my belt can not live in less Your means are very slender and your waste is great I would it were otherwise I would my means were greater and my waist slenderer You have misled the youthful Prince The young Prince hath misled me I am the fellow with the great belly and he my dog Well I am loath to gall a new heal'd wound Your day 's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded over your night 's exploit on Gadshill You may thank th ' unquiet time for your quiet o'erposting that action My lord- But since all is well keep it so wake not a sleeping wolf To wake a wolf is as bad as smell a fox What you are as a candle the better part burnt out A wassail candle my lord- all tallow if I did say of wax my growth would approve the truth There is not a white hair in your face but should have his effect of gravity His effect of gravy gravy You follow the young Prince up and down like his ill angel Not so my lord Your ill angel is light but hope he that looks upon me will take me without weighing And yet in some respects I grant I can not go- I can not tell Virtue is of so little regard in these costermongers ' times that true valour is turn'd berod pregnancy is made a tapster and his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings all the other gifts appertinent to man as the malice of this age shapes them are not worth a gooseberry You that are old consider not the capacities of us that are young you do measure the heat of our livers with the bitterness of your galls and we that are in the vaward of our youth must confess are wags too Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth that are written down old with all the characters of age Have you not a moist eye a dry hand a yellow cheek a white beard a decreasing leg an increasing belly Is not your voice broken your wind short your chin double your wit single and every part about you blasted with antiquity And will you yet call yourself young Fie fie fie Sir John My lord I was born about three of the clock in the afternoon with a white head and something a round belly For my voice- I have lost it with hallooing and singing of anthems To approve my youth further I will not The truth is I am only old in judgment and understanding and he that will caper with me for a thousand marks let him lend me the money and have at him For the box of the ear that the Prince gave you- he gave it like a rude prince and you took it like a sensible lord I have check'd him for it and the young lion repents- marry not in ashes and sackcloth but in new silk and old sack Well God send the Prince a better companion God send the companion a better prince I can not rid my hands of him Well the King hath sever'd you I hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland Yea I thank your pretty sweet wit for it But look you pray all you that kiss my Lady Peace at home that our armies join not in a hot day for by the Lord I take but two shirts out with me and I mean not to sweat extraordinarily If it be a hot day and I brandish anything but a bottle I would I might never spit white again There is not a dangerous action can peep out his head but I am thrust upon it Well I can not last ever but it was alway yet the trick of our English nation if they have a good thing to make it too common If ye will needs say I am an old man you should give me rest I would to God my name were not so terrible to the enemy as it is I were better to be eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to nothing with perpetual motion Well be honest be honest and God bless your expedition Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to furnish me forth Not a penny not a penny you are too impatient to bear crosses Fare you well Commend me to my cousin Westmoreland If I do fillip me with a three man beetle A man can no more separate age and covetousness than ' a can part young limbs and lechery but the gout galls the one and the pox pinches the other and so both the degrees prevent my curses Boy Sir What money is in my purse Seven groats and two pence I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse borrowing only lingers and lingers it out but the disease is incurable Go bear this letter to my Lord of Lancaster this to the Prince this to the Earl of Westmoreland and this to old Mistress Ursula whom I have weekly sworn to marry since I perceiv'd the first white hair of my chin About it you know where to find me Exit PAGE A pox of this gout or a gout of this pox for the one or the other plays the rogue with my great toe ' Tis no matter if I do halt I have the wars for my colour and my pension shall seem the more reasonable A good wit will make use of anything I will turn diseases to commodity Thus have you heard our cause and known our means And my most noble friends I pray you all Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes- And first Lord Marshal what say you to it I well allow the occasion of our amis But gladly would be better satisfied How in our means we should advance ourselves To look with forehead bold and big enough Upon the power and puissance of the King Our present musters grow upon the file To five and twenty thousand men of choice And our supplies live largely in the hope Of great Northumberland whose bosom burns With an incensed fire of injuries The question then Lord Hastings standeth thus Whether our present five and twenty thousand May hold up head without Northumberland With him we may Yea marry there 's the point But if without him we be thought too feeble My judgment is we should not step too far Till we had his assistance by the hand For in a theme so bloody fac'd as this Conjecture expectation and surmise Of aids incertain should not be admitted ' Tis very true Lord Bardolph for indeed It was young Hotspur 's case at Shrewsbury It was my lord who lin'd himself with hope Eating the air and promise of supply Flatt'ring himself in project of a power Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts And so with great imagination Proper to madmen led his powers to death And winking leapt into destruction But by your leave it never yet did hurt To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope Yes if this present quality of war- Indeed the instant action a cause on foot- Lives so in hope as in an early spring We see th ' appearing buds which to prove fruit Hope gives not so much warrant as despair That frosts will bite them When we mean to build We first survey the plot then draw the model And when we see the figure of the house Then we must rate the cost of the erection Which if we find outweighs ability What do we then but draw anew the model In fewer offices or at least desist To build at all Much more in this great work- Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down And set another up- should we survey The plot of situation and the model Consent upon a sure foundation Question surveyors know our own estate How able such a work to undergo- To weigh against his opposite or else We fortify in paper and in figures Using the names of men instead of men Like one that draws the model of a house Beyond his power to build it who half through Gives o'er and leaves his part created cost A naked subject to the weeping clouds And waste for churlish winter 's tyranny Grant that our hopes- yet likely of fair birth- Should be still born and that we now possess'd The utmost man of expectation I think we are so a body strong enough Even as we are to equal with the King What is the King but five and twenty thousand To us no more nay not so much Lord Bardolph For his divisions as the times do brawl Are in three heads one power against the French And one against Glendower perforce a third Must take up us So is the unfirm King In three divided and his coffers sound With hollow poverty and emptiness That he should draw his several strengths together And come against us in full puissance Need not be dreaded If he should do so He leaves his back unarm'd the French and Welsh Baying at his heels Never fear that Who is it like should lead his forces hither The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland Against the Welsh himself and Harry Monmouth But who is substituted against the French I have no certain notice Let us on And publish the occasion of our arms The commonwealth is sick of their own choice Their over greedy love hath surfeited An habitation giddy and unsure Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart O thou fond many with what loud applause Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke Before he was what thou wouldst have him be And being now trimm'd in thine own desires Thou beastly feeder art so full of him That thou provok'st thyself to cast him up So so thou common dog didst thou disgorge Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up And howl'st to find it What trust is in these times They that when Richard liv'd would have him die Are now become enamour'd on his grave Thou that threw'st dust upon his goodly head When through proud London he came sighing on After th ' admired heels of Bolingbroke Criest now ' O earth yield us that king again And take thou this ' O thoughts of men accurs'd Past and to come seems best things present worst Shall we go draw our numbers and set on We are time 's subjects and time bids be gone Master Fang have you ent'red the action It is ent'red Where 's your yeoman Is't a lusty yeoman Will ' a stand to't Sirrah where 's Snare O Lord ay good Master Snare Here here Snare we must arrest Sir John Falstaff Yea good Master Snare I have ent'red him and all It may chance cost some of our lives for he will stab Alas the day take heed of him he stabb'd me in mine own house and that most beastly In good faith ' a cares not what mischief he does if his weapon be out he will foin like any devil he will spare neither man woman nor child If I can close with him I care not for his thrust No nor I neither I 'll be at your elbow An I but fist him once an ' a come but within my vice I am undone by his going I warrant you he 's an infinitive thing upon my score Good Master Fang hold him sure Good Master Snare let him not scape ' A comes continuantly to Pie corner- saving your manhoods- to buy a saddle and he is indited to dinner to the Lubber 's Head in Lumbert Street to Master Smooth 's the silkman I pray you since my exion is ent'red and my case so openly known to the world let him be brought in to his answer A hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to bear and I have borne and borne and borne and have been fubb'd off and fubb'd off and fubb'd off from this day to that day that it is a shame to be thought on There is no honesty in such dealing unless a woman should be made an ass and a beast to bear every knave 's wrong How now whose mare 's dead What 's the matter Sir John I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly Away varlets Draw Bardolph Cut me off the villian 's head Throw the quean in the channel Throw me in the channel I 'll throw thee in the channel Wilt thou wilt thou thou bastardly rogue Murder murder Ah thou honeysuckle villain wilt thou kill God 's officers and the King 's Ah thou honey seed rogue thou art a honey seed a man queller and a woman queller Keep them off Bardolph A rescue a rescue Good people bring a rescue or two Thou wot wot thou thou wot wot ta Do do thou rogue do thou hemp seed Away you scullion you rampallian you fustilarian I 'll tickle your catastrophe What is the matter Keep the peace here ho Good my lord be good to me I beseech you stand to me How now Sir John what are you brawling here Doth this become your place your time and business You should have been well on your way to York Stand from him fellow wherefore hang'st thou upon him O My most worshipful lord an't please your Grace I am a poor widow of Eastcheap and he is arrested at my suit For what sum It is more than for some my lord it is for all- all I have He hath eaten me out of house and home he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of his But I will have some of it out again or I will ride thee a nights like a mare I think I am as like to ride the mare if I have any vantage of ground to get up How comes this Sir John Fie What man of good temper would endure this tempest of exclamation Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so rough a course to come by her own What is the gross sum that I owe thee Marry if thou wert an honest man thyself and the money too Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel gilt goblet sitting in my Dolphin chamber at the round table by a sea coal fire upon Wednesday in Wheeson week when the Prince broke thy head for liking his father to singing man of Windsor- thou didst swear to me then as I was washing thy wound to marry me and make me my lady thy wife Canst thou deny it Did not goodwife Keech the butcher 's wife come in then and call me gossip Quickly Coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar telling us she had a good dish of prawns whereby thou didst desire to eat some whereby I told thee they were ill for green wound And didst thou not when she was gone down stairs desire me to be no more so familiarity with such poor people saying that ere long they should call me madam And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch the thirty shillings I put thee now to thy book oath Deny it if thou canst My lord this is a poor mad soul and she says up and down the town that her eldest son is like you She hath been in good case and the truth is poverty hath distracted her But for these foolish officers I beseech you I may have redress against them Sir John Sir John I am well acquainted with your manner of wrenching the true cause the false way It is not a confident brow nor the throng of words that come with such more than impudent sauciness from you can thrust me from a level consideration You have as it appears to me practis'd upon the easy yielding spirit of this woman and made her serve your uses both in purse and in person Yea in truth my lord Pray thee peace Pay her the debt you owe her and unpay the villainy you have done with her the one you may do with sterling money and the other with current repentance My lord I will not undergo this sneap without reply You call honourable boldness impudent sauciness if a man will make curtsy and say nothing he is virtuous No my lord my humble duty rememb'red I will not be your suitor I say to you I do desire deliverance from these officers being upon hasty employment in the King 's affairs You speak as having power to do wrong but answer in th ' effect of your reputation and satisfy the poor woman Come hither hostess Now Master Gower what news The King my lord and Harry Prince of Wales Are near at hand The rest the paper tells Gives a letter As I am a gentleman Faith you said so before As I am a gentleman Come no more words of it By this heavenly ground I tread on I must be fain to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my dining chambers Glasses glasses is the only drinking and for thy walls a pretty slight drollery or the story of the Prodigal or the German hunting in water work is worth a thousand of these bed hangers and these fly bitten tapestries Let it be ten pound if thou canst Come and ' twere not for thy humours there 's not a better wench in England Go wash thy face and draw the action Come thou must not be in this humour with me dost not know me Come come I know thou wast set on to this Pray thee Sir John let it be but twenty nobles i ' faith I am loath to pawn my plate so God save me la Let it alone I 'll make other shift You 'll be a fool still Well you shall have it though I pawn my gown I hope you 'll come to supper you 'll pay me all together Will I live To BARDOLPH Go with her with her hook on hook on Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper No more words let 's have her I have heard better news What 's the news my lord Where lay the King to night At Basingstoke my lord I hope my lord all 's well What is the news my lord Come all his forces back No fifteen hundred foot five hundred horse Are march'd up to my Lord of Lancaster Against Northumberland and the Archbishop Comes the King back from Wales my noble lord You shall have letters of me presently Come go along with me good Master Gower My lord What 's the matter Master Gower shall I entreat you with me to dinner I must wait upon my good lord here I thank you good Sir John Sir John you loiter here too long being you are to take soldiers up in counties as you go Will you sup with me Master Gower What foolish master taught you these manners Sir John Master Gower if they become me not he was a fool that taught them me This is the right fencing grace my lord tap for tap and so part fair Now the Lord lighten thee Thou art a great fool Before God I am exceeding weary Is't come to that I had thought weariness durst not have attach'd one of so high blood Faith it does me though it discolours the complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it Doth it not show vilely in me to desire small beer Why a prince should not be so loosely studied as to remember so weak a composition Belike then my appetite was not princely got for by my troth I do now remember the poor creature small beer But indeed these humble considerations make me out of love with my greatness What a disgrace is it to me to remember thy name or to know thy face to morrow or to take note how many pair of silk stockings thou hast- viz these and those that were thy peach colour'd ones- or to bear the inventory of thy shirts- as one for superfluity and another for use But that the tennis court keeper knows better than I for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when thou keepest not racket there as thou hast not done a great while because the rest of thy low countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland And God knows whether those that bawl out of the ruins of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom but the midwives say the children are not in the fault whereupon the world increases and kindreds are mightily strengthened How ill it follows after you have laboured so hard you should talk so idly Tell me how many good young princes would do so their fathers being so sick as yours at this time is Shall I tell thee one thing Poins Yes faith and let it be an excellent good thing It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine Go to I stand the push of your one thing that you will tell Marry I tell thee it is not meet that I should be sad now my father is sick albeit I could tell to thee- as to one it pleases me for fault of a better to call my friend- I could be sad and sad indeed too Very hardly upon such a subject By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil 's book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and persistency let the end try the man But I tell thee my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so sick and keeping such vile company as thou art hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow The reason What wouldst thou think of me if I should weep I would think thee a most princely hypocrite It would be every man 's thought and thou art a blessed fellow to think as every man thinks Never a man 's thought in the world keeps the road way better than thine Every man would think me an hypocrite indeed And what accites your most worshipful thought to think so Why because you have been so lewd and so much engraffed to Falstaff And to thee By this light I am well spoke on I can hear it with mine own ears The worst that they can say of me is that I am a second brother and that I am a proper fellow of my hands and those two things I confess I can not help By the mass here comes Bardolph And the boy that I gave Falstaff ' A had him from me Christian and look if the fat villain have not transform'd him ape God save your Grace And yours most noble Bardolph Come you virtuous ass you bashful fool must you be blushing Wherefore blush you now What a maidenly man at arms are you become Is't such a matter to get a pottle pot 's maidenhead ' A calls me e'en now my lord through a red lattice and I could discern no part of his face from the window At last I spied his eyes and methought he had made two holes in the alewife 's new petticoat and so peep'd through Has not the boy profited Away you whoreson upright rabbit away Away you rascally Althaea 's dream away Instruct us boy what dream boy Marry my lord Althaea dreamt she was delivered of a firebrand and therefore I call him her dream A crown 's worth of good interpretation There ' tis boy O that this blossom could be kept from cankers Well there is sixpence to preserve thee An you do not make him be hang'd among you the gallows shall have wrong And how doth thy master Bardolph Well my lord He heard of your Grace 's coming to town There 's a letter for you Deliver'd with good respect And how doth the martlemas your master In bodily health sir Marry the immortal part needs a physician but that moves not him Though that be sick it dies not I do allow this well to be as familiar with me as my dog and he holds his place for look you how he writes Reads ' John Falstaff knight'- Every man must know that as oft as he has occasion to name himself even like those that are kin to the King for they never prick their finger but they say ' There 's some of the King 's blood spilt ' ' How comes that ' says he that takes upon him not to conceive The answer is as ready as a borrower 's cap ' I am the King 's poor cousin sir ' Nay they will be kin to us or they will fetch it from Japhet But the letter Reads ' Sir John Falstaff knight to the son of the King nearest his father Harry Prince of Wales greeting ' Why this is a certificate Peace Reads ' I will imitate the honourable Romans in brevity '- He sure means brevity in breath short winded Reads ' I commend me to thee I commend thee and I leave thee Be not too familiar with Poins for he misuses thy favours so much that he swears thou art to marry his sister Nell Repent at idle times as thou mayst and so farewell My lord I 'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it That 's to make him eat twenty of his words But do you use me thus Ned Must I marry your sister God send the wench no worse fortune But I never said so Well thus we play the fools with the time and the spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us Is your master here in London Yea my lord Where sups he Doth the old boar feed in the old frank At the old place my lord in Eastcheap What company Ephesians my lord of the old church Sup any women with him None my lord but old Mistress Quickly and Mistress Doll Tearsheet What pagan may that be A proper gentlewoman sir and a kinswoman of my master 's Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town bull Shall we steal upon them Ned at supper I am your shadow my lord I 'll follow you Sirrah you boy and Bardolph no word to your master that I am yet come to town There 's for your silence I have no tongue sir And for mine sir I will govern it Fare you well go Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE This Doll Tearsheet should be some road I warrant you as common as the way between Saint Albans and London How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to night in his true colours and not ourselves be seen Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons and wait upon him at his table as drawers From a god to a bull A heavy descension It was Jove 's case From a prince to a prentice A low transformation That shall be mine for in everything the purpose must weigh with the folly Follow me Ned I pray thee loving wife and gentle daughter Give even way unto my rough affairs Put not you on the visage of the times And be like them to Percy troublesome I have given over I will speak no more Do what you will your wisdom be your guide Alas sweet wife my honour is at pawn And but my going nothing can redeem it O yet for God 's sake go not to these wars The time was father that you broke your word When you were more endear'd to it than now When your own Percy when my heart 's dear Harry Threw many a northward look to see his father Bring up his powers but he did long in vain Who then persuaded you to stay at home There were two honours lost yours and your son 's For yours the God of heaven brighten it For his it stuck upon him as the sun In the grey vault of heaven and by his light Did all the chivalry of England move To do brave acts He was indeed the glass Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves He had no legs that practis'd not his gait And speaking thick which nature made his blemish Became the accents of the valiant For those who could speak low and tardily Would turn their own perfection to abuse To seem like him so that in speech in gait In diet in affections of delight In military rules humours of blood He was the mark and glass copy and book That fashion'd others And him- O wondrous him O miracle of men!- him did you leave- Second to none unseconded by you- To look upon the hideous god of war In disadvantage to abide a field Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur 's name Did seem defensible So you left him Never O never do his ghost the wrong To hold your honour more precise and nice With others than with him Let them alone The Marshal and the Archbishop are strong Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers To day might I hanging on Hotspur 's neck Have talk'd of Monmouth 's grave Beshrew your heart Fair daughter you do draw my spirits from me With new lamenting ancient oversights But I must go and meet with danger there Or it will seek me in another place And find me worse provided O fly to Scotland Till that the nobles and the armed commons Have of their puissance made a little taste If they get ground and vantage of the King Then join you with them like a rib of steel To make strength stronger but for all our loves First let them try themselves So did your son He was so suff'red so came I a widow And never shall have length of life enough To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven For recordation to my noble husband Come come go in with me ' Tis with my mind As with the tide swell'd up unto his height That makes a still stand running neither way Fain would I go to meet the Archbishop But many thousand reasons hold me back I will resolve for Scotland There am I Till time and vantage crave my company Exeunt What the devil hast thou brought there apple johns Thou knowest Sir John can not endure an apple john Mass thou say'st true The Prince once set a dish of apple johns before him and told him there were five more Sir Johns and putting off

sleep Nature 's soft nurse how have I frightened thee That thou no more will weigh my eyelids down And steep my senses in forgetfulness Why rather sleep liest thou in smoky cribs Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee And hush'd with buzzing night flies to thy slumber Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great Under the canopies of costly state And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody O thou dull god why liest thou with the vile In loathsome beds and leav'st the kingly couch A watch case or a common ' larum bell Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast Seal up the ship boy 's eyes and rock his brains In cradle of the rude imperious surge And in the visitation of the winds Who take the ruffian billows by the top Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them With deafing clamour in the slippery clouds That with the hurly death itself awakes Canst thou O partial sleep give thy repose To the wet sea boy in an hour so rude And in the calmest and most stillest night With all appliances and means to boot Deny it to a king Then happy low lie down Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown Many good morrows to your Majesty Is it good morrow lords ' Tis one o'clock and past Why then good morrow to you all my lords Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you We have my liege Then you perceive the body of our kingdom How foul it is what rank diseases grow And with what danger near the heart of it It is but as a body yet distempered Which to his former strength may be restored With good advice and little medicine My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd O God that one might read the book of fate And see the revolution of the times Make mountains level and the continent Weary of solid firmness melt itself Into the sea and other times to see The beachy girdle of the ocean Too wide for Neptune 's hips how chances mock And changes fill the cup of alteration With divers liquors O if this were seen The happiest youth viewing his progress through What perils past what crosses to ensue Would shut the book and sit him down and die ' Tis not ten years gone Since Richard and Northumberland great friends Did feast together and in two years after Were they at wars It is but eight years since This Percy was the man nearest my soul Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs And laid his love and life under my foot Yea for my sake even to the eyes of Richard Gave him defiance But which of you was by- To WARWICK You cousin Nevil as I may remember- When Richard with his eye brim full of tears Then check'd and rated by Northumberland Did speak these words now prov'd a prophecy ' Northumberland thou ladder by the which My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne'- Though then God knows I had no such intent But that necessity so bow'd the state That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss- ' The time shall come'- thus did he follow it- ' The time will come that foul sin gathering head Shall break into corruption ' so went on Foretelling this same time 's condition And the division of our amity There is a history in all men 's lives Figuring the natures of the times deceas'd The which observ'd a man may prophesy With a near aim of the main chance of things As yet not come to life who in their seeds And weak beginning lie intreasured Such things become the hatch and brood of time And by the necessary form of this King Richard might create a perfect guess That great Northumberland then false to him Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness Which should not find a ground to root upon Unless on you Are these things then necessities Then let us meet them like necessities And that same word even now cries out on us They say the Bishop and Northumberland Are fifty thousand strong It can not be my lord Rumour doth double like the voice and echo The numbers of the feared Please it your Grace To go to bed Upon my soul my lord The powers that you already have sent forth Shall bring this prize in very easily To comfort you the more I have receiv'd A certain instance that Glendower is dead Your Majesty hath been this fortnight ill And these unseasoned hours perforce must ad Unto your sickness I will take your counsel And

great ones Put me a caliver into Wart 's hand Bardolph Hold Wart Traverse- thus thus thus Come manage me your caliver So- very well Go to very good exceeding good O give me always a little lean old chopt bald shot Well said i ' faith Wart th'art a good scab Hold there 's a tester for thee He is not his craft 's master he doth not do it right I remember at Mile end Green when I lay at Clement 's Inn- I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur 's show- there was a little quiver fellow and ' a would manage you his piece thus and ' a would about and about and come you in and come you in ' Rah tah tah ' would ' a say ' Bounce ' would ' a say and away again would ' a go and again would ' a come I shall ne'er see such a fellow These fellows will do well Master Shallow God keep you Master Silence I will not use many words with you Fare you well Gentlemen both I thank you I must a dozen mile to night Bardolph give the soldiers coats Sir John the Lord bless you God prosper your affairs God send us peace At your return visit our house let our old acquaintance be renewed Peradventure I will with ye to the court Fore God would you would Go to I have spoke at a word God keep you Fare you well gentle gentlemen Exeunt JUSTICES On Bardolph lead the men away Exeunt all but FALSTAFF As I return I will fetch off these justices I do see the bottom of justice Shallow Lord Lord how subject we old men are to this vice of lying This same starv'd justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street and every third word a lie duer paid to the hearer than the Turk 's tribute I do remember him at Clement 's Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese paring When ' a was naked he was for all the world like a fork'd radish with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife ' A was so forlorn that his dimensions to any thick sight were invisible ' A was the very genius of famine yet lecherous as a monkey and the whores call'd him mandrake ' A came ever in the rearward of the fashion and sung those tunes to the overscutch'd huswifes that he heard the carmen whistle and sware they were his fancies or his good nights And now is this Vice 's dagger become a squire and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him and I 'll be sworn ' a ne'er saw him but once in the Tiltyard and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal 's men I saw it and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel skin the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him a court- and now has he land and beeves Well I 'll be acquainted with him if I return and ' t shall go hard but I 'll make him a philosopher 's two stones to me If the young dace be a bait for the old pike I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him Let time shape and there an end Exit What is this forest call'd ' Tis Gaultree Forest an't shall please your Grace Here stand my lords and send discoverers forth To know the numbers of our enemies We have sent forth already ' Tis well done My friends and brethren in these great affairs I must acquaint you that I have receiv'd New dated letters from Northumberland Their cold intent tenour and substance thus Here doth he wish his person with such powers As might hold sortance with his quality The which he could not levy whereupon He is retir'd to ripe his growing fortunes To Scotland and concludes in hearty prayers That your attempts may overlive the hazard And fearful meeting of their opposite Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground And dash themselves to pieces Now what news West of this forest scarcely off a mile In goodly form comes on the enemy And by the ground they hide I judge their number Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand The just proportion that we gave them out Let us sway on and face them in the field What well appointed leader fronts us here I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland Health and fair greeting from our general The Prince Lord John and Duke of Lancaster Say on my Lord of Westmoreland in peace What doth concern your coming Then my lord Unto your Grace do I in chief address The substance of my speech If that rebellion Came like itself in base and abject routs Led on by bloody youth guarded with rags And countenanc'd by boys and beggary- I say if damn'd commotion so appear'd In his true native and most proper shape You reverend father and these noble lords Had not been here to dress the ugly form Of base and bloody insurrection With your fair honours You Lord Archbishop Whose see is by a civil peace maintain'd Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd Whose white investments figure innocence The dove and very blessed spirit of peace- Wherefore you do so ill translate yourself Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace Into the harsh and boist'rous tongue of war Turning your books to graves your ink to blood Your pens to lances and your tongue divine To a loud trumpet and a point of war Wherefore do I this So the question stands Briefly to this end we are all diseas'd And with our surfeiting and wanton hours Have brought ourselves into a burning fever And we must bleed for it of which disease Our late King Richard being infected died But my most noble Lord of Westmoreland I take not on me here as a physician Nor do I as an enemy to peace Troop in the throngs of military men But rather show awhile like fearful war To diet rank minds sick of happiness And purge th ' obstructions which begin to stop Our very veins of life Hear me more plainly I have in equal balance justly weigh'd What wrongs our arms may do what wrongs we suffer And find our griefs heavier than our offences We see which way the stream of time doth run And are enforc'd from our most quiet there By the rough torrent of occasion And have the summary of all our griefs When time shall serve to show in articles Which long ere this we offer'd to the King And might by no suit gain our audience When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs We are denied access unto his person Even by those men that most have done us wrong The dangers of the days but newly gone Whose memory is written on the earth With yet appearing blood and the examples Of every minute 's instance present now Hath put us in these ill beseeming arms Not to break peace or any branch of it But to establish here a peace indeed Concurring both in name and quality When ever yet was your appeal denied Wherein have you been galled by the King What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you That you should seal this lawless bloody book Of forg'd rebellion with a seal divine And consecrate commotion 's bitter edge My brother general the commonwealth To brother horn an household cruelty I make my quarrel in particular There is no need of any such redress Or if there were it not belongs to you Why not to him in part and to us all That feel the bruises of the days before And suffer the condition of these times To lay a heavy and unequal hand Upon our honours O my good Lord Mowbray Construe the times to their necessities And you shall say indeed it is the time And not the King that doth you injuries Yet for your part it not appears to me Either from the King or in the present time That you should have an inch of any ground To build a grief on Were you not restor'd To all the Duke of Norfolk 's signiories Your noble and right well rememb'red father 's What thing in honour had my father lost That need to be reviv'd and breath'd in me The King that lov'd him as the state stood then Was force perforce compell'd to banish him And then that Henry Bolingbroke and he Being mounted and both roused in their seats Their neighing coursers daring of the spur Their armed staves in charge their beavers down Their eyes of fire sparkling through sights of steel And the loud trumpet blowing them together- Then then when there was nothing could have stay'd My father from the breast of Bolingbroke O when the King did throw his warder down- His own life hung upon the staff he threw- Then threw he down himself and all their lives That by indictment and by dint of sword Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke You speak Lord Mowbray now you know not what The Earl of Hereford was reputed then In England the most valiant gentleman Who knows on whom fortune would then have smil'd But if your father had been victor there He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry For all the country in a general voice Cried hate upon him and all their prayers and love Were set on Hereford whom they doted on And bless'd and grac'd indeed more than the King But this is mere digression from my purpose Here come I from our princely general To know your griefs to tell you from his Grace That he will give you audience and wherein It shall appear that your demands are just You shall enjoy them everything set off That might so much as think you enemies But he hath forc'd us to compel this offer And it proceeds from policy not love Mowbray you overween to take it so This offer comes from mercy not from fear For lo within a ken our army lies- Upon mine honour all too confident To give admittance to a thought of fear Our battle is more full of names than yours Our men more perfect in the use of arms Our armour all as strong our cause the best Then reason will our hearts should be as good Say you not then our offer is compell'd Well by my will we shall admit no parley That argues but the shame of your offence A rotten case abides no handling Hath the Prince John a full commission In very ample virtue of his father To hear and absolutely to determine Of what conditions we shall stand upon That is intended in the general 's name I muse you make so slight a question Then take my Lord of Westmoreland this schedule For this contains our general grievances Each several article herein redress'd All members of our cause both here and hence That are insinewed to this action Acquitted by a true substantial form And present execution of our wills To us and to our purposes confin'd- We come within our awful banks again And knit our powers to the arm of peace This will I show the general Please you lords In sight of both our battles we may meet And either end in peace- which God so frame!- Or to the place of diff'rence call the swords Which must decide it My lord we will do so Exit WESTMORELAND There is a thing within my bosom tells me That no conditions of our peace can stand Fear you not that if we can make our peace Upon such large terms and so absolute As our conditions shall consist upon Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains Yea but our valuation shall be such That every slight and false derived cause Yea every idle nice and wanton reason Shall to the King taste of this action That were our royal faiths martyrs in love We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff And good from bad find no partition No no my lord Note this the King is weary Of dainty and such picking grievances For he hath found to end one doubt by death Revives two greater in the heirs of life And therefore will he wipe his tables clean And keep no tell tale to his memory That may repeat and history his los To new remembrance For full well he knows He can not so precisely weed this land As his misdoubts present occasion His foes are so enrooted with his friends That plucking to unfix an enemy He doth unfasten so and shake a friend So that this land like an offensive wife That hath enrag'd him on to offer strokes As he is striking holds his infant up And hangs resolv'd correction in the arm That was uprear'd to execution Besides the King hath wasted all his rods On late offenders that he now doth lack The very instruments of chastisement So that his power like to a fangless lion May offer but not hold ' Tis very true And therefore be assur'd my good Lord Marshal If we do now make our atonement well Our peace will like a broken limb united Grow stronger for the breaking Be it so Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland The Prince is here at hand Pleaseth your lordship To meet his Grace just distance ' tween our armies Your Grace of York in God 's name then set forward Before and greet his Grace My lord we come You are well encount'red here my cousin Mowbray Good day to you gentle Lord Archbishop And so to you Lord Hastings and to all My Lord of York it better show'd with you When that your flock assembled by the bell Encircled you to hear with reverence Your exposition on the holy text Than now to see you here an iron man Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum Turning the word to sword and life to death That man that sits within a monarch 's heart And ripens in the sunshine of his favour Would he abuse the countenance of the king Alack what mischiefs might he set abroach In shadow of such greatness With you Lord Bishop It is even so Who hath not heard it spoken How deep you were within the books of God To us the speaker in His parliament To us th ' imagin'd voice of God himself The very opener and intelligencer Between the grace the sanctities of heaven And our dull workings O who shall believe But you misuse the reverence of your place Employ the countenance and grace of heav'n As a false favourite doth his prince 's name In deeds dishonourable You have ta'en up Under the counterfeited zeal of God The subjects of His substitute my father And both against the peace of heaven and him Have here up swarm'd them Good my Lord of Lancaster I am not here against your father 's peace But as I told my Lord of Westmoreland The time misord'red doth in common sense Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form To hold our safety up I sent your Grace The parcels and particulars of our grief The which hath been with scorn shov'd from the court Whereon this hydra son of war is born Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep With grant of our most just and right desires And true obedience of this madness cur'd Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty If not we ready are to try our fortunes To the last man And though we here fall down We have supplies to second our attempt If they miscarry theirs shall second them And so success of mischief shall be born And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up Whiles England shall have generation YOU are too shallow Hastings much to shallow To sound the bottom of the after times Pleaseth your Grace to answer them directly How far forth you do like their articles I like them all and do allow them well And swear here by the honour of my blood My father 's purposes have been mistook And some about him have too lavishly Wrested his meaning and authority My lord these griefs shall be with speed redress'd Upon my soul they shall If this may please you Discharge your powers unto their several counties As we will ours and here between the armies Let 's drink together friendly and embrace That all their eyes may bear those tokens home Of our restored love and amity I take your princely word for these redresses I give it you and will maintain my word And thereupon I drink unto your Grace Go Captain and deliver to the army This news of peace Let them have pay and part I know it will please them Hie thee Captain To you my noble Lord of Westmoreland I pledge your Grace and if you knew what pains I have bestow'd to breed this present peace You would drink freely but my love to ye Shall show itself more openly hereafter I do not doubt you I am glad of it Health to my lord and gentle cousin Mowbray You wish me health in very happy season For I am on the sudden something ill Against ill chances men are ever merry But heaviness foreruns the good event Therefore be merry coz since sudden sorrow Serves to say thus ' Some good thing comes to morrow ' Believe me I am passing light in spirit So much the worse if your own rule be true The word of peace is rend'red Hark how they shout This had been cheerful after victory A peace is of the nature of a conquest For then both parties nobly are subdu'd And neither party loser Go my lord And let our army be discharged too Go good Lord Hastings And ere they be dismiss'd let them march by I trust lords we shall lie to night together The leaders having charge from you to stand Will not go off until they hear you speak They know their duties My lord our army is dispers'd already Like youthful steers unyok'd they take their courses East west north south or like a school broke up Each hurries toward his home and sporting place Good tidings my Lord Hastings for the which I do arrest thee traitor of high treason And you Lord Archbishop and you Lord Mowbray Of capital treason I attach you both Is this proceeding just and honourable Is your assembly so Will you thus break your faith I pawn'd thee none I promis'd you redress of these same grievances Whereof you did complain which by mine honour I will perform with a most Christian care But for you rebels- look to taste the due Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours Most shallowly did you these arms commence Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence Strike up our drums pursue the scatt'red stray God and not we hath safely fought to day Some guard these traitors to the block of death Treason 's true bed and yielder up of breath Exeunt What 's your name sir Of what condition are you and of what place I pray I am a knight sir and my name is Colville of the Dale Well then Colville is your name a knight is your degree and your place the Dale Colville shall still be your name a traitor your degree and the dungeon your place- a place deep enough so shall you be still Colville of the Dale Are not you Sir John Falstaff As good a man as he sir whoe'er I am Do you yield sir or shall I sweat for you If I do sweat they are the drops of thy lovers and they weep for thy death therefore rouse up fear and trembling and do observance to my mercy I think you are Sir John Falstaff and in that thought yield me I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of mine and not a tongue of them all speaks any other word but my name An I had but a belly of any indifferency I were simply the most active fellow in Europe My womb my womb my womb undoes me Here comes our general The heat is past follow no further now Call in the powers good cousin Westmoreland I would be sorry my lord but it should be thus I never knew yet but rebuke and check was the reward of valour Do you think me a swallow an arrow or a bullet Have I in my poor and old motion the expedition of thought I have speeded hither with the very extremest inch of possibility I have found'red nine score and odd posts and here travel tainted as I am have in my pure and immaculate valour taken Sir John Colville of the Dale a most furious knight and valorous enemy But what of that He saw me and yielded that I may justly say with the hook nos'd fellow of Rome I came saw and overcame It was more of his courtesy than your deserving I know not Here he is and here I yield him and I beseech your Grace let it be book'd with the rest of this day 's deeds or by the Lord I will have it in a particular ballad else with mine own picture on the top on't Colville kissing my foot to the which course if I be enforc'd if you do not all show like gilt twopences to me and I in the clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full moon doth the cinders of the element which show like pins ' heads to her believe not the word of the noble Therefore let me have right and let desert mount Thine 's too heavy to mount Let it shine then Thine 's too thick to shine Let it do something my good lord that may do me good and call it what you will Is thy name Colville It is my lord A famous rebel art thou Colville And a famous true subject took him I am my lord but as my betters are That led me hither Had they been rul'd by me You should have won them dearer than you have I know not how they sold themselves but thou like a kind fellow gavest thyself away gratis and I thank thee for thee Now have you left pursuit Retreat is made and execution stay'd Send Colville with his confederates To York to present execution Blunt lead him hence and see you guard him sure My lord I beseech you give me leave to go through Gloucestershire and when you come to court stand my good lord pray in your good report Fare you well Falstaff I in my condition Shall better speak of you than you deserve I would you had but the wit ' twere better than your dukedom Good faith this same young sober blooded boy doth not love me nor a man can not make him laugh- but that 's no marvel he drinks no wine There 's never none of these demure boys come to any proof for thin drink doth so over cool their blood and making many fish meals that they fall into a kind of male green sickness and then when they marry they get wenches They are generally fools and cowards which some of us should be too but for inflammation A good sherris sack hath a two fold operation in it It ascends me into the brain dries me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapours which environ it makes it apprehensive quick forgetive full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes which delivered o'er to the voice the tongue which is the birth becomes excellent wit The second property of your excellent sherris is the warming of the blood which before cold and settled left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extremes It illumineth the face which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom man to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart who great and puff'd up with this retinue doth any deed of courage- and this valour comes of sherris So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack for that sets it a work and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till sack commences it and sets it in act and use Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father he hath like lean sterile and bare land manured husbanded and till'd with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris that he is become very hot and valiant If I had a thousand sons the first humane principle I would teach them should be to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack The army is discharged all and gone Let them go I 'll through Gloucestershire and there will I visit Master Robert Shallow Esquire I have him already temp'ring between my finger and my thumb and shortly will I seal with him Come away Exeunt Now lords if God doth give successful end To this debate that bleedeth at our doors We will our youth lead on to higher fields And draw no swords but what are sanctified Our navy is address'd our power connected Our substitutes in absence well invested And everything lies level to our wish Only we want a little personal strength And pause us till these rebels now afoot Come underneath the yoke of government Both which we doubt not but your Majesty Shall soon enjoy Humphrey my son of Gloucester Where is the Prince your brother I think he 's gone to hunt my lord at Windsor And how accompanied I do not know my lord Is not his brother Thomas of Clarence with him No my good lord he is in presence here What would my lord and father Nothing but well to thee Thomas of Clarence How chance thou art not with the Prince thy brother He loves thee and thou dost neglect him Thomas Thou hast a better place in his affection Than all thy brothers cherish it my boy And noble offices thou mayst effect Of mediation after I am dead Between his greatness and thy other brethren Therefore omit him not blunt not his love Nor lose the good advantage of his grace By seeming cold or careless of his will For he is gracious if he be observ'd He hath a tear for pity and a hand Open as day for melting charity Yet notwithstanding being incens'd he is flint As humorous as winter and as sudden As flaws congealed in the spring of day His temper therefore must be well observ'd Chide him for faults and do it reverently When you perceive his blood inclin'd to mirth But being moody give him line and scope Till that his passions like a whale on ground Confound themselves with working Learn this Thomas And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in That the united vessel of their blood Mingled with venom of suggestion- As force perforce the age will pour it in- Shall never leak though it do work as strong As aconitum or rash gunpowder I shall observe him with all care and love Why art thou not at Windsor with him Thomas He is not there to day he dines in London And how accompanied Canst thou tell that With Poins and other his continual followers Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds And he the noble image of my youth Is overspread with them therefore my grief Stretches itself beyond the hour of death The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape In forms imaginary th'unguided days And rotten times that you shall look upon When I am sleeping with my ancestors For when his headstrong riot hath no curb When rage and hot blood are his counsellors When means and lavish manners meet together O with what wings shall his affections fly Towards fronting peril and oppos'd decay My gracious lord you look beyond him quite The Prince but studies his companions Like a strange tongue wherein to gain the language ' Tis needful that the most immodest word Be look'd upon and learnt which once attain'd Your Highness knows comes to no further use But to be known and hated So like gross terms The Prince will in the perfectness of time Cast off his followers and their memory Shall as a pattern or a measure live By which his Grace must mete the lives of other Turning past evils to advantages ' Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb In the dead carrion Health to my sovereign and new happiness Added to that that am to deliver Prince John your son doth kiss your Grace 's hand Mowbray the Bishop Scroop Hastings and all Are brought to the correction of your law There is not now a rebel 's sword unsheath'd But Peace puts forth her olive everywhere The manner how this action hath been borne Here at more leisure may your Highness read With every course in his particular O Westmoreland thou art a summer bird Which ever in the haunch of winter sings The lifting up of day From enemies heaven keep your Majesty And when they stand against you may they fall As those that I am come to tell you of The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph With a great power of English and of Scots Are by the shrieve of Yorkshire overthrown The manner and true order of the fight This packet please it you contains at large And wherefore should these good news make me sick Will Fortune never come with both hands full But write her fair words still in foulest letters She either gives a stomach and no food- Such are the poor in health- or else a feast And takes away the stomach- such are the rich That have abundance and enjoy it not I should rejoice now at this happy news And now my sight fails and my brain is giddy O me come near me now I am much ill Comfort your Majesty O my royal father My sovereign lord cheer up yourself look up Be patient Princes you do know these fits Are with his Highness very ordinary Stand from him give him air he 'll straight be well No no he can not long hold out these pangs Th ' incessant care and labour of his mind Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in So thin that life looks through and will break out The people fear me for they do observe Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature The seasons change their manners as the year Had found some months asleep and leapt them over The river hath thrice flow'd no ebb between And the old folk Time 's doting chronicles Say it did so a little time before That our great grandsire Edward sick'd and died Speak lower Princes for the King recovers This apoplexy will certain be his end I pray you take me up and bear me hence Into some other chamber Softly pray Exeunt Let there be no noise made my gentle friends Unless some dull and favourable hand Will whisper music to my weary spirit Call for the music in the other room Set me the crown upon my pillow here His eye is hollow and he changes much Less noise less noise Who saw the Duke of Clarence I am here brother full of heaviness How now Rain within doors and none abroad How doth the King Exceeding ill Heard he the good news yet Tell it him He alt'red much upon the hearing it If he be sick with joy he 'll recover without physic Not so much noise my lords Sweet Prince speak low The King your father is dispos'd to sleep Let us withdraw into the other room Will't please your Grace to go along with us No I will sit and watch here by the King Warwick Gloucester Clarence Doth the King call What would your Majesty How fares your Grace Why did you leave me here alone my lords We left the Prince my brother here my liege Who undertook to sit and watch by you The Prince of Wales Where is he Let me see him He is not here This door is open he is gone this way He came not through the chamber where we stay'd Where is the crown Who took it from my pillow When we withdrew my liege we left it here The Prince hath ta'en it hence Go seek him out Is he so hasty that he doth suppose My sleep my death Find him my lord of Warwick chide him hither My lord I found the Prince in the next room Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks With such a deep demeanour in great sorrow That tyranny which never quaff'd but blood Would by beholding him have wash'd his knife With gentle eye drops He is coming hither But wherefore did he take away the crown I never thought to hear you speak again Thy wish was father Harry to that thought I stay too long by thee I weary thee Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours Before thy hour be ripe O foolish youth Thou seek'st the greatness that will overwhelm thee Stay but a little for my cloud of dignity Is held from falling with so weak a wind That it will quickly drop my day is dim Thou hast stol'n that which after some few hours Were thine without offense and at my death Thou hast seal'd up my expectation Thy life did manifest thou lov'dst me not And thou wilt have me die assur'd of it Thou hid'st a thousand daggers in thy thoughts Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart To stab at half an hour of my life What canst thou not forbear me half an hour Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear That thou art crowned not that I am dead Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head Only compound me with forgotten dust Give that which gave thee life unto the worms Pluck down my officers break my decrees For now a time is come to mock at form- Harry the Fifth is crown'd Up vanity Down royal state All you sage counsellors hence And to the English court assemble now From every region apes of idleness Now neighbour confines purge you of your scum Have you a ruffian that will swear drink dance Revel the night rob murder and commit The oldest sins the newest kind of ways Be happy he will trouble you no more England shall double gild his treble guilt England shall give him office honour might For the fifth Harry from curb'd license plucks The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent O my poor kingdom sick with civil blows When that my care could not withhold thy riots What wilt thou do when riot is thy care O thou wilt be a wilderness again Peopled with wolves thy old inhabitants O pardon me my liege But for my tears The moist impediments unto my speech I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard The course of it so far There is your crown And he that wears the crown immortally Long guard it yours Kneeling If I affect it more Than as your honour and as your renown Let me no more from this obedience rise Which my most inward true and duteous spirit Teacheth this prostrate and exterior bending God witness with me when I here came in And found no course of breath within your Majesty How cold it struck my heart If I do feign O let me in my present wildness die And never live to show th ' incredulous world The noble change that I have purposed Coming to look on you thinking you dead- And dead almost my liege to think you were- I spake unto this crown as having sense And thus upbraided it ' The care on thee depending Hath fed upon the body of my father Therefore thou best of gold art worst of gold Other less fine in carat is more precious Preserving life in med'cine potable But thou most fine most honour'd most renown'd Hast eat thy bearer up ' Thus my most royal liege Accusing it I put it on my head To try with it- as with an enemy That had before my face murd'red my father- The quarrel of a true inheritor But if it did infect my blood with joy Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride If any rebel or vain spirit of mine Did with the least affection of a welcome Give entertainment to the might of it Let God for ever keep it from my head And make me as the poorest vassal is That doth with awe and terror kneel to it O my son God put it in thy mind to take it hence That thou mightst win the more thy father 's love Pleading so wisely in excuse of it Come hither Harry sit thou by my bed And hear I think the very latest counsel That ever I shall breathe God knows my son By what by paths and indirect crook'd ways I met this crown and I myself know well How troublesome it sat upon my head To thee it shall descend with better quiet Better opinion better confirmation For all the soil of the achievement goes With me into the earth It seem'd in me But as an honour snatch'd with boist'rous hand And I had many living to upbraid My gain of it by their assistances Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed Wounding supposed peace All these bold fears Thou seest with peril I have answered For all my reign hath been but as a scene Acting that argument And now my death Changes the mood for what in me was purchas'd Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort So thou the garland wear'st successively Yet though thou stand'st more sure than I could do Thou art not firm enough since griefs are green And all my friends which thou must make thy friends Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out By whose fell working I was first advanc'd And by whose power I well might lodge a fear To be again displac'd which to avoid I cut them off and had a purpose now To lead out many to the Holy Land Lest rest and lying still might make them look Too near unto my state Therefore my Harry Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels that action hence borne out May waste the memory of the former days More would I but my lungs are wasted so That strength of speech is utterly denied me How I came by the crown O God forgive And grant it may with thee in true peace live My gracious liege You won it wore it kept it gave it me Then plain and right must my possession be Which I with more than with a common pain ' Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain Look look here comes my John of Lancaster Health peace and happiness to my royal father Thou bring'st me happiness and peace son John But health alack with youthful wings is flown From this bare wither'd trunk Upon thy sight My worldly business makes a period Where is my Lord of Warwick My Lord of Warwick Doth any name particular belong Unto the lodging where I first did swoon ' Tis call'd Jerusalem my noble lord Laud be to God Even there my life must end It hath been prophesied to me many years I should not die but in Jerusalem Which vainly I suppos'd the Holy Land But bear me to that chamber there I 'll lie In that

my heart kind Master Bardolph To the PAGE And welcome my tall fellow Come Sir John I 'll follow you good Master Robert Shallow Exit SHALLOW Bardolph look to our horses Exeunt BARDOLPH and PAGE If I were sawed into quantities I should make four dozen of such bearded hermits ' staves as Master Shallow It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men 's spirits and his They by observing of him do bear themselves like foolish justices he by conversing with them is turned into a justice like serving man Their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent like so many wild geese If I had a suit to Master Shallow I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master if to his men I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught as men take diseases one of another therefore let men take heed of their company I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions which is four terms or two actions and ' a shall laugh without intervallums O it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders O you shall see him laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up Within Sir John I come Master Shallow I come Master Shallow How now my Lord Chief Justice whither away How doth the King Exceeding well his cares are now all ended I hope not dead He 's walk'd the way of nature And to our purposes he lives no more I would his Majesty had call'd me with him The service that I truly did his life Hath left me open to all injuries Indeed I think the young king loves you not I know he doth not and do arm myself To welcome the condition of the time Which can not look more hideously upon me Than I have drawn it in my fantasy Here comes the heavy issue of dead Harry O that the living Harry had the temper Of he the worst of these three gentlemen How many nobles then should hold their places That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort O God I fear all will be overturn'd Good morrow cousin Warwick good morrow We meet like men that had forgot to speak We do remember but our argument Is all too heavy to admit much talk Well peace be with him that hath made us heavy Peace be with us lest we be heavier O good my lord you have lost a friend indeed And I dare swear you borrow not that face Of seeming sorrow- it is sure your own Though no man be assur'd what grace to find You stand in coldest expectation I am the sorrier would ' twere otherwise Well you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair Which swims against your stream of quality Sweet Princes what I did I did in honour Led by th ' impartial conduct of my soul And never shall you see that I will beg A ragged and forestall'd remission If truth and upright innocency fail me I 'll to the King my master that is dead And tell him who hath sent me after him Here comes the Prince Good morrow and God save your Majesty This new and gorgeous garment majesty Sits not so easy on me as you think Brothers you mix your sadness with some fear This is the English not the Turkish court Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds But Harry Harry Yet be sad good brothers For by my faith it very well becomes you Sorrow so royally in you appears That I will deeply put the fashion on And wear it in my heart Why then be sad But entertain no more of it good brothers Than a joint burden laid upon us all For me by heaven I bid you be assur'd I 'll be your father and your brother too Let me but bear your love I 'll bear your cares Yet weep that Harry 's dead and so will I But Harry lives that shall convert those tears By number into hours of happiness We hope no otherwise from your Majesty You all look strangely on me and you most You are I think assur'd I love you not I am assur'd if I be measur'd rightly Your Majesty hath no just cause to hate me No How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me What rate rebuke and roughly send to prison Th ' immediate heir of England Was this easy May this be wash'd in Lethe and forgotten I then did use the person of your father The image of his power lay then in me And in th ' administration of his law Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth Your Highness pleased to forget my place The majesty and power of law and justice The image of the King whom I presented And struck me in my very seat of judgment Whereon as an offender to your father I gave bold way to my authority And did commit you If the deed were ill Be you contented wearing now the garland To have a son set your decrees at nought To pluck down justice from your awful bench To trip the course of law and blunt the sword That guards the peace and safety of your person Nay more to spurn at your most royal image And mock your workings in a second body Question your royal thoughts make the case yours Be now the father and propose a son Hear your own dignity so much profan'd See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd And then imagine me taking your part And in your power soft silencing your son After this cold considerance sentence me And as you are a king speak in your state What I have done that misbecame my place My person or my liege 's sovereignty You are right Justice and you weigh this well Therefore still bear the balance and the sword And I do wish your honours may increase Till you do live to see a son of mine Offend you and obey you as I did So shall I live to speak my father 's words ' Happy am I that have a man so bold That dares do justice on my proper son And not less happy having such a son That would deliver up his greatness so Into the hands of justice ' You did commit me For which I do commit into your hand Th ' unstained sword that you have us'd to bear With this remembrance- that you use the same With the like bold just and impartial spirit As you have done ' gainst me There is my hand You shall be as a father to my youth My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear And I will stoop and humble my intents To your well practis'd wise directions And Princes all believe me I beseech you My father is gone wild into his grave For in his tomb lie my affections And with his spirits sadly I survive To mock the expectation of the world To frustrate prophecies and to raze out Rotten opinion who hath writ me down After my seeming The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea Where it shall mingle with the state of floods And flow henceforth in formal majesty Now call we our high court of parliament And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel That the great body of our state may go In equal rank with the best govern'd nation That war or peace or both at once may be As things acquainted and familiar to us In which you father shall have foremost hand Our coronation done we will accite As I before rememb'red all our state And- God consigning to my good intents- No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say God shorten Harry 's happy life one day Exeunt Nay you shall see my orchard where in an arbour we will eat a last year 's pippin of mine own graffing with a dish of

I would have bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you But ' tis no matter this poor show doth better this doth infer the zeal I had to see him It doth so It shows my earnestness of affection- It doth so My devotion- It doth it doth it doth As it were to ride day and night and not to deliberate not to remember not to have patience to shift me- It is best certain But to stand stained with travel and sweating with desire to see him thinking of nothing else putting all affairs else in oblivion as if there were nothing else to be done but to see him ' Tis ' semper idem ' for ' obsque hoc nihil est ' ' Tis all in every part ' Tis so indeed My knight I will inflame thy noble liver And make thee rage Thy Doll and Helen of thy noble thoughts Is in base durance and contagious prison Hal'd

wits Know you what ' tis you speak My king my Jove I speak to thee my heart I know thee not old man Fall to thy prayers How ill white hairs become a fool and jester I have long dreamt of such a kind of man So surfeit swell'd so old and so profane But being awak'd I do despise my dream Make less thy body hence and more thy grace Leave gormandizing know the grave doth gape For thee thrice wider than for other men- Reply not to me with a fool born jest Presume not that I am the thing I was For God doth know so shall the world perceive That I have turn'd away my former self So will I those that kept me company When thou dost hear I am as I have been Approach me and thou shalt be as thou wast The tutor and the feeder of my riots Till then I banish thee on pain of death As I have done the rest of my misleaders Not to come near our person by ten mile For competence of life I will allow you That lack of means enforce you not to evils And as we hear you do reform yourselves We will according to your strengths and qualities Give you advancement Be it your charge my lord To see perform'd the tenour of our word Set on Exeunt the KING and his train Master Shallow I owe you a thousand pounds Yea marry Sir John which I beseech you to let me have home with me That can hardly be Master Shallow Do not you grieve at this I shall be sent for in private to him Look you he must seem thus to the world Fear not your advancements I will be the man yet that shall make you great I can not perceive how unless you give me your doublet and stuff me out with straw I beseech you good Sir John let me have five hundred of my thousand Sir I will be as good as my word This that you heard was but a colour A colour that I fear you will die in Sir John Fear no colours go with me to dinner Come Lieutenant Pistol come Bardolph I shall be sent for soon at night Go carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet Take all his company along with him My lord my lord- I can not now speak I will hear you soon Take them away Si fortuna me tormenta spero me contenta I like this fair proceeding of the King 's He hath intent his wonted followers Shall all be very well provided for But all are banish'd till their conversations Appear more wise and modest to the world And so they are The King hath call'd his parliament my lord He hath I will lay odds that ere this year expire We bear our civil swords and native fire As far as France I heard a bird so sing Whose music to my thinking pleas'd the King Come will you hence Exeunt Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury Not here in presence Send for him good uncle Shall we call in th ' ambassador my liege Not yet my cousin we would be resolv'd Before we hear him of some things of weight That task our thoughts concerning us and France God and his angels guard your sacred throne And make you long become it Sure we thank you My learned lord we pray you to proceed And justly and religiously unfold Why the law Salique that they have in France Or should or should not bar us in our claim And God forbid my dear and faithful lord That you should fashion wrest or bow your reading Or nicely charge your understanding soul With opening titles miscreate whose right Suits not in native colours with the truth For God doth know how many now in health Shall drop their blood in approbation Of what your reverence shall incite us to Therefore take heed how you impawn our person How you awake our sleeping sword of war- We charge you in the name of God take heed For never two such kingdoms did contend Without much fall of blood whose guiltless drops Are every one a woe a sore complaint ' Gainst him whose wrongs gives edge unto the swords That makes such waste in brief mortality Under this conjuration speak my lord For we will hear note and believe in heart That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd As pure as sin with baptism Then hear me gracious sovereign and you peers That owe yourselves your lives and services To this imperial throne There is no bar To make against your Highness ' claim to France But this which they produce from Pharamond ' In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant'- ' No woman shall succeed in Salique land ' Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze To be the realm of France and Pharamond The founder of this law and female bar Yet their own authors faithfully affirm That the land Salique is in Germany Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe Where Charles the Great having subdu'd the Saxons There left behind and settled certain French Who holding in disdain the German women For some dishonest manners of their life Establish'd then this law to wit no female Should be inheritrix in Salique land Which Salique as I said ' twixt Elbe and Sala Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen Then doth it well appear the Salique law Was not devised for the realm of France Nor did the French possess the Salique land Until four hundred one and twenty years After defunction of King Pharamond Idly suppos'd the founder of this law Who died within the year of our redemption Four hundred twenty six and Charles the Great Subdu'd the Saxons and did seat the French Beyond the river Sala in the year Eight hundred five Besides their writers say King Pepin which deposed Childeric Did as heir general being descended Of Blithild which was daughter to King Clothair Make claim and title to the crown of France Hugh Capet also who usurp'd the crown Of Charles the Duke of Lorraine sole heir male Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great To find his title with some shows of truth- Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught- Convey'd himself as th ' heir to th ' Lady Lingare Daughter to Charlemain who was the son To Lewis the Emperor and Lewis the son Of Charles the Great Also King Lewis the Tenth Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet Could not keep quiet in his conscience Wearing the crown of France till satisfied That fair Queen Isabel his grandmother Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Lorraine By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great Was re united to the Crown of France So that as clear as is the summer 's sun King Pepin 's title and Hugh Capet 's claim King Lewis his satisfaction all appear To hold in right and tide of the female So do the kings of France unto this day Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law To bar your Highness claiming from the female And rather choose to hide them in a net Than amply to imbar their crooked tides Usurp'd from you and your progenitors May I with right and conscience make this claim The sin upon my head dread sovereign For in the book of Numbers is it writ When the man dies let the inheritance Descend unto the daughter Gracious lord Stand for your own unwind your bloody flag Look back into your mighty ancestors Go my dread lord to your great grandsire 's tomb From whom you claim invoke his warlike spirit And your great uncle 's Edward the Black Prince Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy Making defeat on the fun power of France Whiles his most mighty father on a hill Stood smiling to behold his lion 's whelp Forage in blood of French nobility O noble English that could entertain With half their forces the full pride of France And let another half stand laughing by All out of work and cold for action Awake remembrance of these valiant dead And with your puissant arm renew their feats You are their heir you sit upon their throne The blood and courage that renowned them Runs in your veins and my thrice puissant liege Is in the very May morn of his youth Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth Do all expect that you should rouse yourself As did the former lions of your blood They know your Grace hath cause and means and might- So hath your Highness never King of England Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France O let their bodies follow my dear liege With blood and sword and fire to win your right In aid whereof we of the spiritualty Will raise your Highness such a mighty sum As never did the clergy at one time Bring in to any of your ancestors We must not only arm t ' invade the French But lay down our proportions to defend Against the Scot who will make road upon us With all advantages They of those marches gracious sovereign Shall be a wall sufficient to defend Our inland from the pilfering borderers We do not mean the coursing snatchers only But fear the main intendment of the Scot Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us For you shall read that my great grandfather Never went with his forces into France But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom Came pouring like the tide into a breach With ample and brim fulness of his force Galling the gleaned land with hot assays Girdling with grievous siege castles and towns That England being empty of defence Hath shook and trembled at th ' ill neighbourhood She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd my liege For hear her but exampled by herself When all her chivalry hath been in France And she a mourning widow of her nobles She hath herself not only well defended But taken and impounded as a stray The King of Scots whom she did send to France To fill King Edward 's fame with prisoner kings And make her chronicle as rich with praise As is the ooze and bottom of the sea With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries But there 's a saying very old and true It follows then the cat must stay at home Yet that is but a crush'd necessity Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves While that the armed hand doth fight abroad Th ' advised head defends itself at home For government though high and low and lower Put into parts doth keep in one consent Congreeing in a full and natural close Like music Therefore doth heaven divide The state of man in divers functions Setting endeavour in continual motion To which is fixed as an aim or but Obedience for so work the honey bees Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom They have a king and officers of sorts Where some like magistrates correct at home Others like merchants venture trade abroad Others like soldiers armed in their stings Make boot upon the summer 's velvet buds Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent royal of their emperor Who busied in his majesty surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold The civil citizens kneading up the honey The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate The sad ey'd justice with his surly hum Delivering o'er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone I this infer That many things having full reference To one consent may work contrariously As many arrows loosed several ways Come to one mark as many ways meet in one town As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea As many lines close in the dial 's centre So many a thousand actions once afoot End in one purpose and be all well home Without defeat Therefore to France my liege Divide your happy England into four Whereof take you one quarter into France And you withal shall make all Gallia shake If we with thrice such powers left at home Can not defend our own doors from the dog Let us be worried and our nation lose The name of hardiness and policy Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin May't please your Majesty to give us leave Freely to render what we have in charge Or shall we sparingly show you far of The Dauphin 's meaning and our embassy We are no tyrant but a Christian king Unto whose grace our passion is as subject As are our wretches fett'red in our prisons Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness Tell us the Dauphin 's mind Thus then in few Your Highness lately sending into France Did claim some certain dukedoms in the right Of your great predecessor King Edward the Third In answer of which claim the Prince our master Says that you savour too much of your youth And bids you be advis'd there 's nought in France That can be with a nimble galliard won You can not revel into dukedoms there He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit This tun of treasure and in lieu of this Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim Hear no more of you This the Dauphin speaks What treasure uncle Tennis balls my liege We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us His present and your pains we thank you for When we have match'd our rackets to these balls We will in France by God 's grace play a set Shall strike his father 's crown into the hazard Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler That all the courts of France will be disturb'd With chaces And we understand him well How he comes o'er us with our wilder days Not measuring what use we made of them We never valu'd this poor seat of England And therefore living hence did give ourself To barbarous licence as ' tis ever common That men are merriest when they are from home But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state Be like a king and show my sail of greatness When I do rouse me in my throne of France For that I have laid by my majesty And plodded like a man for working days But I will rise there with so full a glory That I will dazzle all the eyes of France Yea strike the Dauphin blind to look on us And tell the pleasant Prince this mock of his Hath turn'd his balls to gun stones and his soul Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance That shall fly with them for many a thousand widows Shall this his mock mock of their dear husbands Mock mothers from their sons mock castles down And some are yet ungotten and unborn That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin 's scorn But this lies all within the will of God To whom I do appeal and in whose name Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on To venge me as I may and to put forth My rightful hand in a well hallow'd cause So get you hence in peace and tell the Dauphin His jest will savour but of shallow wit When thousands weep more than did laugh at it Convey them with safe conduct Fare you well This was a merry message We hope to make the sender blush at it Therefore my lords omit no happy hour That may give furth'rance to our expedition For we have now no thought in us but France Save those to God that run before our business Therefore let our proportions for these wars Be soon collected and all things thought upon That may with reasonable swiftness ad More feathers to our wings for God before We 'll chide this Dauphin at his father 's door Therefore let every man now task his thought That this fair action may on foot be brought Exeunt Now all the youth of England are on fire And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies Now thrive the armourers and honour 's thought Reigns solely in the breast of every man They sell the pasture now to buy the horse Following the mirror of all Christian kings With winged heels as English Mercuries For now sits Expectation in the air And hides a sword from hilts unto the point With crowns imperial crowns and coronets Promis'd to Harry and his followers The French advis'd by good intelligence Of this most dreadful preparation Shake in their fear and with pale policy Seek to divert the English purposes O England model to thy inward greatness Like little body with a mighty heart What mightst thou do that honour would thee do Were all thy children kind and natural But see thy fault France hath in thee found out A nest of hollow bosoms which he fills With treacherous crowns and three corrupted men- One Richard Earl of Cambridge and the second Henry Lord Scroop of Masham and the third Sir Thomas Grey knight of Northumberland Have for the gilt of France- O guilt indeed!- Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France And by their hands this grace of kings must die- If hell and treason hold their promises Ere he take ship for France- and in Southampton Linger your patience on and we 'll digest Th ' abuse of distance force a play The sum is paid the traitors are agreed The King is set from London and the scene Is now transported gentles to Southampton There is the play house now there must you sit And thence to France shall we convey you safe And bring you back charming the narrow seas To give you gentle pass for if we may We 'll not offend one stomach with our play But till the King come forth and not till then Unto Southampton do we shift our scene Exit Well met Corporal Nym Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolph What are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet For my part I care not I say little but when time shall serve there shall be smiles- but that shall be as it may I dare not fight but I will wink and hold out mine iron It

ill Away you rogue By my troth he 'll yield the crow a pudding one of these days the King has kill'd his heart Good husband come home presently Exeunt HOSTESS and BOY Come shall I make you two friends We must to France together why the devil should we keep knives to cut one another 's throats Let floods o'erswell and fiends for food howl on You 'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting Base is the slave that pays That now I will have that 's the humour of it As manhood shall compound push home By this sword he that makes the first thrust I 'll kill him by this sword I will Sword is an oath and oaths must have their course Corporal Nym an thou wilt be friends be friends an thou wilt not why then be enemies with me too Prithee put up I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at

shall sutler be Unto the camp and profits will accrue Give me thy hand Sheathing his sword I shall have my noble In cash most justly paid Shaking hands Well then that 's the humour of't As ever you come of women come in quickly to Sir John Ah poor heart he is so shak'd of a burning quotidian tertian that it is most lamentable to behold Sweet men come to him The King hath run bad humours on the knight that 's the even of it Nym thou hast spoke the right His heart is fracted and corroborate The King is a good king but it must be as it may he passes some humours and careers Let us condole the knight for lambkins we will live Fore God his Grace is bold to trust these traitors They shall be apprehended by and by How smooth and even they do bear themselves As if allegiance in their bosoms sat Crowned with faith and constant loyalty The King hath note of all that they intend By interception which they dream not of Nay but the man that was his bedfellow Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours- That he should for a foreign purse so sell His sovereign 's life to death and treachery Now sits the wind fair and we will aboard My Lord of Cambridge and my kind Lord of Masham And you my gentle knight give me your thoughts Think you not that the pow'rs we bear with us Will cut their passage through the force of France Doing the execution and the act For which we have in head assembled them No doubt my liege if each man do his best I doubt not that since we are well persuaded We carry not a heart with us from hence That grows not in a fair consent with ours Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish Success and conquest to attend on us Never was monarch better fear'd and lov'd Than is your Majesty There 's not I think a subject That sits in heart grief and uneasines Under the sweet shade of your government True those that were your father 's enemies Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you With hearts create of duty and of zeal We therefore have great cause of thankfulness And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner than quittance of desert and merit According to the weight and worthiness So service shall with steeled sinews toil And labour shall refresh itself with hope To do your Grace incessant services We judge no less Uncle of Exeter Enlarge the man committed yesterday That rail'd against our person We consider It was excess of wine that set him on And on his more advice we pardon him That 's mercy but too much security Let him be punish'd sovereign lest example Breed by his sufferance more of such a kind O let us yet be merciful So may your Highness and yet punish too Sir You show great mercy if you give him life After the taste of much correction Alas your too much love and care of me Are heavy orisons ' gainst this poor wretch If little faults proceeding on distemper Shall not be wink'd at how shall we stretch our eye When capital crimes chew'd swallow'd and digested Appear before us We 'll yet enlarge that man Though Cambridge Scroop and Grey in their dear care And tender preservation of our person Would have him punish'd And now to our French causes Who are the late commissioners I one my lord Your Highness bade me ask for it to day So did you me my liege And I my royal sovereign Then Richard Earl of Cambridge there is yours There yours Lord Scroop of Masham and Sir Knight Grey of Northumberland this same is yours Read them and know I know your worthiness My Lord of Westmoreland and uncle Exeter We will aboard to night Why how now gentlemen What see you in those papers that you lose So much complexion Look ye how they change Their cheeks are paper Why what read you there That have so cowarded and chas'd your blood Out of appearance I do confess my fault And do submit me to your Highness ' mercy The mercy that was quick in us but late I arrest thee of high treason by the name of Richard Earl Our purposes God justly hath discover'd And I repent my fault more than my death Which I beseech your Highness to forgive Although my body pay the price of it For me the gold of France did not seduce Although I did admit it as a motive The sooner to effect what I intended But God be thanked for prevention Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice Beseeching God and you to pardon me Never did faithful subject more rejoice At the discovery of most dangerous treason Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself Prevented from a damned enterprise My fault but not my body pardon sovereign God quit you in his mercy Hear your sentence You have conspir'd against our royal person Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers Receiv'd the golden earnest of our death Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter His princes and his peers to servitude His subjects to oppression and contempt And his whole kingdom into desolation Touching our person seek we no revenge But we our kingdom 's safety must so tender Whose ruin you have sought that to her laws We do deliver you Get you therefore hence Poor miserable wretches to your death The taste whereof God of his mercy give You patience to endure and true repentance Of all your dear offences Bear them hence Prithee honey sweet husband let me bring thee to No for my manly heart doth earn Bardolph be blithe Nym rouse thy vaunting veins Boy bristle thy courage up For Falstaff he is dead And we must earn therefore Would I were with him wheresome'er he is either in heaven or in hell Nay sure he 's not in hell he 's in Arthur 's bosom if ever man went to Arthur 's bosom ' A made a finer end and went away an it had been any christom child ' a parted ev'n just between twelve and one ev'n at the turning o ' th ' tide for after I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with flowers and smile upon his fingers ' end I knew there was but one way for his nose was as sharp as a pen and ' a babbl'd of green fields ' How now Sir John ' quoth I ' What man be o ' good cheer ' So ' a cried out ' God God God ' three or four times Now I to comfort him bid him ' a should not think of God I hop'd there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet So ' a bade me lay more clothes on his feet I put my hand into the bed and felt them and they were as cold as any stone then I felt to his knees and so upward and upward and all was as cold as any stone They say he cried out of sack Ay that ' a did And of women Nay that ' a did not Yes that ' a did and said they were devils incarnate ' A could never abide carnation ' twas a colour he never liked ' A said once the devil would have him about women ' A did in some sort indeed handle women but then he was rheumatic and talk'd of the Whore of Babylon Do you not remember ' a saw a flea stick upon Bardolph 's nose and ' a said it was a black soul burning in hell Well the fuel is gone that maintain'd that fire that 's all the riches I got in his service Shall we shog The King will be gone from Southampton Come let 's away My love give me thy lips Look to my chattles and my moveables Let senses rule The word is ' Pitch and Pay ' Trust none For oaths are straws men 's faiths are wafer cakes And Holdfast is the only dog my duck Therefore Caveto be thy counsellor Go clear thy crystals Yoke fellows in arms Let us to France like horse leeches my boys To suck to suck the very blood to suck And that 's but unwholesome food they say Touch her soft mouth and march Farewell hostess Kissing her I can not kiss that is the humour of it but adieu Let housewifery appear keep close I thee command Farewell adieu Exeunt Thus comes the English with full power upon us And more than carefully it us concerns To answer royally in our defences Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Britaine Of Brabant and of Orleans shall make forth And you Prince Dauphin with all swift dispatch To line and new repair our towns of war With men of courage and with means defendant For England his approaches makes as fierce As waters to the sucking of a gulf It fits us then to be as provident As fear may teach us out of late examples Left by the fatal and neglected English Upon our fields My most redoubted father It is most meet we arm us ' gainst the foe For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom Though war nor no known quarrel were in question But that defences musters preparations Should be maintain'd assembled and collected As were a war in expectation Therefore I say ' tis meet we all go forth To view the sick and feeble parts of France And let us do it with no show of fear- No with no more than if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitsun morris dance For my good liege she is so idly king'd Her sceptre so fantastically borne By a vain giddy shallow humorous youth That fear attends her not O peace Prince Dauphin You are too much mistaken in this king Question your Grace the late ambassadors With what great state he heard their embassy How well supplied with noble counsellors How modest in exception and withal How terrible in constant resolution And you shall find his vanities forespent Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus Covering discretion with a coat of folly As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots That shall first spring and be most delicate Well ' tis not so my Lord High Constable But though we think it so it is no matter In cases of defence ' tis best to weigh The enemy more mighty than he seems So the proportions of defence are fill'd Which of a weak and niggardly projection Doth like a miser spoil his coat with scanting A little cloth Think we King Harry strong And Princes look you strongly arm to meet him The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us And he is bred out of that bloody strain That haunted us in our familiar paths Witness our too much memorable shame When Cressy battle fatally was struck And all our princes capdv'd by the hand Of that black name Edward Black Prince of Wales Whiles that his mountain sire- on mountain standing Up in the air crown'd with the golden sun- Saw his heroical seed and smil'd to see him Mangle the work of nature and deface The patterns that by God and by French fathers Had twenty years been made This is a stern Of that victorious stock and let us fear The native mightiness and fate of him Ambassadors from Harry King of England Do crave admittance to your Majesty We 'll give them present audience Go and bring them Turn head and stop pursuit for coward dogs Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten Runs far before them Good my sovereign Take up the English short and let them know Of what a monarchy you are the head Self love my liege is not so vile a sin As self neglecting From our brother of England From him and thus he greets your Majesty He wills you in the name of God Almighty That you divest yourself and lay apart The borrowed glories that by gift of heaven By law of nature and of nations ' longs To him and to his heirs- namely the crown And all wide stretched honours that pertain By custom and the ordinance of times Unto the crown of France That you may know ' Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim Pick'd from the worm holes of long vanish'd days Nor from the dust of old oblivion rak'd He sends you this most memorable line Gives a paper In every branch truly demonstrative Willing you overlook this pedigree And when you find him evenly deriv'd From his most fam'd of famous ancestors Edward the Third he bids you then resign Your crown and kingdom indirectly held From him the native and true challenger Or else what follows Bloody constraint for if you hide the crown Even in your hearts there will he rake for it Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming In thunder and in earthquake like a Jove That if requiring fail he will compel And bids you in the bowels of the Lord Deliver up the crown and to take mercy On the poor souls for whom this hungry war Opens his vasty jaws and on your head Turning the widows ' tears the orphans ' cries The dead men 's blood the privy maidens ' groans For husbands fathers and betrothed lovers That shall be swallowed in this controversy This is his claim his threat'ning and my message Unless the Dauphin be in presence here To whom expressly I bring greeting too For us we will consider of this further To morrow shall you bear our full intent Back to our brother of England For the Dauphin I stand here for him What to him from England Scorn and defiance slight regard contempt And anything that may not misbecome The mighty sender doth he prize you at Thus says my king an if your father 's Highness Do not in grant of all demands at large Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his Majesty He 'll call you to so hot an answer of it That caves and womby vaultages of France Shall chide your trespass and return your mock In second accent of his ordinance Say if my father render fair return It is against my will for I desire Nothing but odds with England To that end As matching to his youth and vanity I did present him with the Paris balls He 'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it Were it the mistress court of mighty Europe And be assur'd you 'll find a difference As we his subjects have in wonder found Between the promise of his greener days And these he masters now Now he weighs time Even to the utmost grain that you shall read In your own losses if he stay in France To morrow shall you know our mind at full Dispatch us with all speed lest that our king Come here himself to question our delay For he is footed in this land already You shall be soon dispatch'd with fair conditions A night is but small breath and little pause To answer matters of this consequence Flourish Exeunt Thus with imagin'd wing our swift scene flies In motion of no less celerity Than that of thought Suppose that you have seen The well appointed King at Hampton pier Embark his royalty and his brave fleet With silken streamers the young Phorbus fanning Play with your fancies and in them behold Upon the hempen tackle ship boys climbing Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give To sounds confus'd behold the threaden sails Borne with th ' invisible and creeping wind Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea Breasting the lofty surge O do but think You stand upon the rivage and behold A city on th ' inconstant billows dancing For so appears this fleet majestical Holding due course to Harfleur Follow follow Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy And leave your England as dead midnight still Guarded with grandsires babies and old women Either past or not arriv'd to pith and puissance For who is he whose chin is but enrich'd With one appearing hair that will not follow These cull'd and choice drawn cavaliers to France Work work your thoughts and therein see a siege Behold the ordnance on their carriages With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur Suppose th ' ambassador from the French comes back Tells Harry that the King doth offer him Katherine his daughter and with her to dowry Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms The offer likes not and the nimble gunner With linstock now the devilish cannon touches Once more unto the breach dear friends once more Or close the wall up with our English dead In peace there 's nothing so becomes a man As modest stillness and humility But when the blast of war blows in our ears Then imitate the action of the tiger Stiffen the sinews summon up the blood Disguise fair nature with hard favour'd rage Then lend the eye a terrible aspect Let it pry through the portage of the head Like the brass cannon let the brow o'erwhelm it As fearfully as doth a galled rock O'erhang and jutty his confounded base Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit To his full height On on you noblest English Whose blood is fet from fathers of war proof- Fathers that like so many Alexanders Have in these parts from morn till even fought And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument Dishonour not your mothers now attest That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you Be copy now to men of grosser blood And teach them how to war And you good yeomen Whose limbs were made in England show us here The mettle of your pasture let us swear That you are worth your breeding- which I doubt not For there is none of you so mean and base That hath not noble lustre in your eyes I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips Straining upon the start The game 's afoot Follow your spirit and upon this charge Cry ' God for Harry England and Saint George ' On on on on on to the breach to the breach Pray thee Corporal stay the knocks are too hot and for mine own part I have not a case of lives The humour of it is too hot that is the very plain song of it The plain song is most just for humours do abound Would I were in an alehouse in London I wouid give all my fame for a pot of ale and safety And I As duly but not as truly Up to the breach you dogs Avaunt you cullions Driving them forward Be merciful great duke to men of mould Abate thy rage abate thy manly rage Abate thy rage great duke Good bawcock bate thy rage Use lenity sweet chuck These be good humours Your honour wins bad humours As young as I am I have observ'd these three swashers I am boy to them all three but all they three though they would serve me could not be man to me for indeed three such antics do not amount to a man For Bardolph he is white liver'd and red fac'd by the means whereof ' a faces it out but fights not For Pistol he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword by the means whereof ' a breaks words and keeps whole weapons For Nym he hath heard that men of few words are the best men and therefore he scorns to say his prayers lest ' a should be thought a coward but his few bad words are match'd with as few good deeds for ' a never broke any man 's head but his own and that was against a post when he was drunk They will steal anything and call it purchase Bardolph stole a lute case bore it twelve leagues and sold it for three halfpence Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching and in Calais they stole a fire shovel I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals They would have me as familiar with men 's pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers which makes much against my manhood if I should take from another 's pocket to put into mine for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs I must leave them and seek some better service their villainy goes against my weak stomach and therefore I must cast it up Exit Captain Fluellen you must come presently to the mines the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you To the mines Tell you the Duke it is not so good to come to the mines for look you the mines is not according to the disciplines of the war the concavities of it is not sufficient For look you th ' athversary- you may discuss unto the Duke look you- is digt himself four yard under the countermines by Cheshu I think ' a will plow up all if there is not better directions The Duke of Gloucester to whom the order of the siege is given is altogether directed by an Irishman- a very vallant gentleman i ' faith It is Captain Macmorris is it not I think it be By Cheshu he is an ass as in the world I will verify as much in his beard he has no more directions in the true disciplines of the wars look you of the Roman disciplines than is a puppy dog Here ' a comes and the Scots captain Captain Jamy with him Captain Jamy is a marvellous falorous gentleman that is certain and of great expedition and knowledge in th ' aunchient wars upon my particular knowledge of his directions By Cheshu he will maintain his argument as well as any military man in the world in the disciplines of the pristine wars of the Romans I say gud day Captain Fluellen God den to your worship good Captain James How now Captain Macmorris Have you quit the mines Have the pioneers given o'er By Chrish la tish ill done The work ish give over the trompet sound the retreat By my hand I swear and my father 's soul the work ish ill done it ish give over I would have blowed up the town so Chrish save me la in an hour O tish ill done tish ill done by my hand tish ill done Captain Macmorris I beseech you now will you voutsafe me look you a few disputations with you as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the war the Roman wars in the way of argument look you and friendly communication partly to satisfy my opinion and partly for the satisfaction look you of my mind as touching the direction of the military discipline that is the point It sall be vary gud gud feith gud captains bath and I sall quit you with gud leve as I may pick occasion that sall I marry It is no time to discourse so Chrish save me The day is hot and the weather and the wars and the King and the Dukes it is no time to discourse The town is beseech'd and the trumpet call us to the breach and we talk and be Chrish do nothing ' Tis shame for us all so God sa ' me ' tis shame to stand still it is shame by my hand and there is throats to be cut and works to be done and there ish nothing done so Chrish sa ' me la By the mess ere theise eyes of mine take themselves to slomber ay'll de gud service or I 'll lig i ' th ' grund for it ay or go to death And I 'll pay't as valorously as I may that sall I suerly do that is the breff and the long Marry I wad full fain heard some question ' tween you tway Captain Macmorris I think look you under your correction there is not many of your nation- Of my nation What ish my nation Ish a villain and a bastard and a knave and a rascal What ish my nation Who talks of my nation Look you if you take the matter otherwise than is meant Captain Macmorris peradventure I shall think you do not use me with that affability as in discretion you ought to use me look you being as good a man as yourself both in the disciplines of war and in the derivation of my birth and in other particularities I do not know you so good a man as myself so Chrish save me I will cut off your head Gentlemen both you will mistake each other Ah that 's a foul fault A parley sounded The town sounds a parley Captain Macmorris when there is more better opportunity to be required look you I will be so bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war and there is an end Exeunt How yet resolves the Governor of the town This is the latest parle we will admit Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves Or like to men proud of destruction Defy us to our worst for as I am a soldier A name that in my thoughts becomes me best If I begin the batt'ry once again I will not leave the half achieved Harfleur Till in her ashes she lie buried The gates of mercy shall be all shut up And the flesh'd soldier rough and hard of heart In liberty of bloody hand shall range With conscience wide as hell mowing like grass Your fresh fair virgins and your flow'ring infants What is it then to me if impious war Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends Do with his smirch'd complexion all fell feats Enlink'd to waste and desolation What is't to me when you yourselves are cause If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation What rein can hold licentious wickednes When down the hill he holds his fierce career We may as bootless spend our vain command Upon th ' enraged soldiers in their spoil As send precepts to the Leviathan To come ashore Therefore you men of Harfleur Take pity of your town and of your people Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds Of heady murder spoil and villainy If not- why in a moment look to see The blind and bloody with foul hand Defile the locks of your shrill shrieking daughters Your fathers taken by the silver beards And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls Your naked infants spitted upon pikes Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confus'd Do break the clouds as did the wives of Jewry At Herod 's bloody hunting slaughtermen What say you Will you yield and this avoid Or guilty in defence be thus destroy'd Our expectation hath this day an end The Dauphin whom of succours we entreated Returns us that his powers are yet not ready To raise so great a siege Therefore great King We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy Enter our gates dispose of us and ours For we no longer are defensible Open your gates Exit GOVERNOR Come uncle Exeter Go you and enter Harfleur there remain And fortify it strongly ' gainst the French Use mercy to them all For us dear uncle The winter coming on and sickness growing Upon our soldiers we will retire to Calais To night in Harfleur will we be your guest To morrow for the march

Shall a few sprays of us The emptying of our fathers ' luxury Our scions put in wild and savage stock Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds And overlook their grafters Normans but bastard Normans Norman bastards Mort Dieu ma vie if they march along Unfought withal but I will sell my dukedom To buy a slobb'ry and a dirty farm In that nook shotten isle of Albion Dieu de batailles where have they this mettle Is not their climate foggy raw and dull On whom as in despite the sun looks pale Killing their fruit with frowns Can sodden water A drench for sur rein'd jades their barley broth Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat And shall our quick blood spirited with wine Seem frosty O for honour of our land Let us not hang like roping icicles Upon our houses ' thatch whiles a more frosty people Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields- Poor we call them in their native lords By faith and honour Our madams mock at us and plainly say Our mettle is bred out and they will give Their bodies to the lust of English youth To new store France with bastard warriors They bid us to the English dancing schools And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos Saying our grace is only in our heels And that we are most lofty runaways Where is Montjoy the herald Speed him hence Let him greet England with our sharp defiance Up Princes and with spirit of honour edged More sharper than your swords hie to the field Charles Delabreth High Constable of France You Dukes of Orleans Bourbon and of Berri Alengon Brabant Bar and Burgundy Jaques Chatillon Rambures Vaudemont Beaumont Grandpre Roussi and Fauconbridge Foix Lestrake Bouciqualt and Charolois High dukes great princes barons lords and knights For your great seats now quit you of great shames Bar Harry England that sweeps through our land With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur Rush on his host as doth the melted snow Upon the valleys whose low vassal seat The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon Go down upon him you have power enough And in a captive chariot into Rouen Bring him our prisoner This becomes the great Sorry am I his numbers are so few His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march For I am sure when he shall see our army He 'll drop his heart into the sink of fear And for achievement offer us his ransom Therefore Lord Constable haste on Montjoy And let him say to England that we send To know what willing ransom he will give Prince Dauphin you shall stay with us in Rouen Not so I do beseech your Majesty Be patient for you shall remain with us Now forth Lord Constable and Princes all And quickly bring us word of England 's fall Exeunt How now Captain Fluellen Come you from the bridge I assure you there is very excellent services committed at the bridge Is the Duke of Exeter safe The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon and a man that I love and honour with my soul and my heart and my duty and my live and my living and my uttermost power He is not- God be praised and blessed!- any hurt in the world but keeps the bridge most valiantly with excellent discipline There is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the bridge- I think in my very conscience he is as valiant a man as Mark Antony and he is man of no estimation in the world but I did see him do as gallant service What do you call him He is call'd Aunchient Pistol I know him not Here is the man Captain I thee beseech to do me favours The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well Ay I praise God and I have merited some love at his hands Bardolph a soldier firm and sound of heart And of buxom valour hath by cruel fate And giddy Fortune 's furious fickle wheel That goddess blind That stands upon the rolling restless stone- By your patience Aunchient Pistol Fortune is painted blind with a muffler afore her eyes to signify to you that Fortune is blind and she is painted also with a wheel to signify to you which is the moral of it that she is turning and inconstant and mutability and variation and her foot look you is fixed upon a spherical stone which rolls and rolls and rolls In good truth the poet makes a most excellent description of it Fortune is an excellent moral Fortune is Bardolph 's foe and frowns on him For he hath stol'n a pax and hanged must ' a be- A damned death Let gallows gape for dog let man go free And let not hemp his windpipe suffocate But Exeter hath given the doom of death For pax of little price Therefore go speak- the Duke will hear thy voice And let not Bardolph 's vital thread be cut With edge of penny cord and vile reproach Speak Captain for his life and I will thee requite Aunchient Pistol I do partly understand your meaning Why then rejoice therefore Certainly Aunchient it is not a thing to rejoice at for if look you he were my brother I would desire the Duke to use his good pleasure and put him to execution for discipline ought to be used Die and be damn'd and figo for thy friendship It is well The fig of Spain Exit Very good Why this is an arrant counterfeit rascal I remember him now- a bawd a cutpurse I 'll assure you ' a utt'red as prave words at the pridge as you shall see in a summer 's day But it is very well what he has spoke to me that is well I warrant you when time is serve Why ' tis a gull a fool a rogue that now and then goes to the wars to grace himself at his return into London under the form of a soldier And such fellows are perfect in the great commanders ' names and they will learn you by rote where services were done- at such and such a sconce at such a breach at such a convoy who came off bravely who was shot who disgrac'd what terms the enemy stood on and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war which they trick up with new tuned oaths and what a beard of the General 's cut and a horrid suit of the camp will do among foaming bottles and ale wash'd wits is wonderful to be thought on But you must learn to know such slanders of the age or else you may be marvellously mistook I tell you what Captain Gower I do perceive he is not the man that he would gladly make show to the world he is if I find a hole in his coat I will tell him my mind Drum within Hark you the King is coming and I must speak with him from the pridge How now Fluellen Cam'st thou from the bridge Ay so please your Majesty The Duke of Exeter has very gallantly maintain'd the pridge the French is gone off look you and there is gallant and most prave passages Marry th ' athversary was have possession of the pridge but he is enforced to retire and the Duke of Exeter is master of the pridge I can tell your Majesty the Duke is a prave man What men have you lost Fluellen The perdition of th ' athversary hath been very great reasonable great marry for my part I think the Duke hath lost never a man but one that is like to be executed for robbing a church- one Bardolph if your Majesty know the man his face is all bubukles and whelks and knobs and flames o ' fire and his lips blows at his nose and it is like a coal of fire sometimes plue and sometimes red but his nose is executed and his fire 's out We would have all such offenders so cut off And we give express charge that in our marches through the country there be nothing compell'd from the villages nothing taken but paid for none of the French upbraided or abused in disdainful language for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom the gentler gamester is the soonest winner You know me by my habit Well then I know thee what shall I know of thee My master 's mind Unfold it Thus says my king Say thou to Harry of England Though we seem'd dead we did but sleep advantage is a better soldier than rashness Tell him we could have rebuk'd him at Harfleur but that we thought not good to bruise an injury till it were full ripe Now we speak upon our cue and our voice is imperial England shall repent his folly see his weakness and admire our sufferance Bid him therefore consider of his ransom which must proportion the losses we have borne the subjects we have lost the disgrace we have digested which in weight to re answer his pettiness would bow under For our losses his exchequer is too poor for th ' effusion of our blood the muster of his kingdom too faint a number and for our disgrace his own person kneeling at our feet but a weak and worthless satisfaction To this add defiance and tell him for conclusion he hath betrayed his followers whose condemnation is pronounc'd So far my king and master so much my office What is thy name I know thy quality Montjoy Thou dost thy office fairly Turn thee back And tell thy king I do not seek him now But could be willing to march on to Calais Without impeachment for to say the sooth- Though ' tis no wisdom to confess so much Unto an enemy of craft and vantage- My people are with sickness much enfeebled My numbers lessen'd and those few I have Almost no better than so many French Who when they were in health I tell thee herald I thought upon one pair of English legs Did march three Frenchmen Yet forgive me God That I do brag thus this your air of France Hath blown that vice in me I must repent Go therefore tell thy master here I am My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk My army but a weak and sickly guard Yet God before tell him we will come on Though France himself and such another neighbour Stand in our way There 's for thy labour Montjoy Go bid thy master well advise himself If we may pass we will if we be hind'red We shall your tawny ground with your red blood Discolour and so Montjoy fare you well The sum of all our answer is but this We would not seek a battle as we are Nor as we are we say we will not shun it So tell your master I shall deliver so Thanks to your Highness Exit I hope they will not come upon us now We are in God 's hand brother not in theirs March to the bridge it now draws toward night Beyond the river we 'll encamp ourselves And on to morrow bid them march away Exeunt Tut I have the best armour of the world Would it were day You have an excellent armour but let my horse have his due It is the best horse of Europe Will it never be morning My Lord of Orleans and my Lord High Constable you talk of horse and armour You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world What a long night is this I will not change my horse with any that treads but on four pasterns Ca ha he bounds from the earth as if his entrails were hairs le cheval volant the Pegasus chez les narines de feu When I bestride him I soar I am a hawk He trots the air the earth sings when he touches it the basest horn of his hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes He 's of the colour of the nutmeg And of the heat of the ginger It is a beast for Perseus he is pure air and fire and the dull elements of earth and water never appear in him but only in patient stillness while his rider mounts him he is indeed a horse and all other jades you may call beasts Indeed my lord it is a most absolute and excellent horse It is the prince of palfreys his neigh is like the bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage No more cousin Nay the man hath no wit that can not from the rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb vary deserved praise on my palfrey It is a theme as fluent as the sea turn the sands into eloquent tongues and my horse is argument for them all ' tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on and for a sovereign 's sovereign to ride on and for the world- familiar to us and unknown- to lay apart their particular functions and wonder at him I once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus ' Wonder of nature'- I have heard a sonnet begin so to one 's mistress Then did they imitate that which I compos'd to my courser for my horse is my mistress Your mistress bears well Me well which is the prescript praise and perfection of a good and particular mistress Nay for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly shook your back So perhaps did yours Mine was not bridled O then belike she was old and gentle and you rode like a kern of Ireland your French hose off and in your strait strossers You have good judgment in horsemanship Be warn'd by me then they that ride so and ride not warily fall into foul bogs I had rather have my horse to my mistress I had as lief have my mistress a jade I tell thee Constable my mistress wears his own hair I could make as true a boast as that if I had a sow to my mistress ' Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement et la truie lavee au bourbier ' Thou mak'st use of anything Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress or any such proverb so little kin to the purpose My Lord Constable the armour that I saw in your tent to night- are those stars or suns upon it Stars my lord Some of them will fall to morrow I hope And yet my sky shall not want That may be for you bear a many superfluously and ' twere more honour some were away Ev'n as your horse bears your praises who would trot as well were some of your brags dismounted Would I were able to load him with his desert Will it never be day I will trot to morrow a mile and my way shall be paved with English faces I will not say so for fear I should be fac'd out of my way but I would it were morning for I would fain be about the ears of the English Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners You must first go yourself to hazard ere you have them ' Tis midnight I 'll go arm myself Exit The Dauphin longs for morning He longs to eat the English I think he will eat all he kills By the white hand of my lady he 's a gallant prince Swear by her foot that she may tread out the oath He is simply the most active gentleman of France Doing is activity and he will still be doing He never did harm that I heard of Nor will do none to morrow he will keep that good name still I know him to be valiant I was told that by one that knows him better than you What 's he Marry he told me so himself and he said he car'd not who knew it He needs not it is no hidden virtue in him By my faith sir but it is never anybody saw it but Ill wind never said well I will cap that proverb with ' There is flattery in friendship ' And I will take up that with ' Give the devil his due ' Well plac'd There stands your friend for the devil have at the very eye of that proverb with ' A pox of the devil ' You are the better at proverbs by how much ' A fool 's bolt is soon shot ' You have shot over ' Tis not the first time you were overshot My Lord High Constable the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents Who hath measur'd the ground The Lord Grandpre A valiant and most expert gentleman Would it were day Alas poor Harry of England he longs not for the dawning as we do What a wretched and peevish fellow is this King of England to mope with his fat brain'd followers so far out of his knowledge If the English had any apprehension they would run away That they lack for if their heads had any intellectual armour they could never wear such heavy head pieces That island of England breeds very valiant creatures their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage Foolish curs that run winking into the mouth of a Russian bear and have their heads crush'd like rotten apples You may as well say that 's a valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion Just just and the men do sympathise with the mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on leaving their wits with their wives and then give them great meals of beef and iron and steel they will eat like wolves and fight like devils Ay but these English are shrewdly out of beef Then shall we find to morrow they have only stomachs to eat and none to fight Now is it time to arm Come shall we about it It is now two o'clock but let me see- by ten We shall have each a hundred Englishmen Exeunt Now entertain conjecture of a time When creeping murmur and the poring dark Fills the wide vessel of the universe From camp to camp through the foul womb of night The hum of either army stilly sounds That the fix'd sentinels almost receive The secret whispers of each other 's watch Fire answers fire and through their paly flames Each battle sees the other 's umber'd face Steed threatens steed in high and boastful neighs Piercing the night 's dull ear and from the tents The armourers accomplishing the knights With busy hammers closing rivets up Give dreadful note of preparation The country cocks do crow the clocks do ton And the third hour of drowsy morning name Proud of their numbers and secure in soul The confident and over lusty French Do the low rated English play at dice And chide the cripple tardy gaited night Who like a foul and ugly witch doth limp So tediously away The poor condemned English Like sacrifices by their watchful fires Sit patiently and inly ruminate The morning 's danger and their gesture sad Investing lank lean cheeks and war worn coats Presenteth them unto the gazing moon So many horrid ghosts O now who will behold The royal captain of this ruin'd band Walking from watch to watch from tent to tent Let him cry ' Praise and glory on his head ' For forth he goes and visits all his host Bids them good morrow with a modest smile And calls them brothers friends and countrymen Upon his royal face there is no note How dread an army hath enrounded him Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour Unto the weary and all watched night But freshly looks and over bears attaint With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty That every wretch pining and pale before Beholding him plucks comfort from his looks A largess universal like the sun His liberal eye doth give to every one Thawing cold fear that mean and gentle all Behold as may unworthiness define A little touch of Harry in the night And so our scene must to the battle fly Where- O for pity!- we shall much disgrace With four or five most vile and ragged foils Right ill dispos'd in brawl ridiculous The name of Agincourt Yet sit and see Minding true things by what their mock'ries be Exit Gloucester ' tis true that we are in great danger The greater therefore should our courage be Good morrow brother Bedford God Almighty There is some soul of goodness in things evil Would men observingly distil it out For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers Which is both healthful and good husbandry Besides they are our outward consciences And preachers to us all admonishing That we should dress us fairly for our end Thus may we gather honey from the weed And make a moral of the devil himself Not so my liege this lodging likes me better Since I may say ' Now lie I like a king ' ' Tis good for men to love their present pains Upon example so the spirit is eased And when the mind is quick'ned out of doubt The organs though defunct and dead before Break up their drowsy grave and newly move With casted slough and fresh legerity Lend me thy cloak Sir Thomas Brothers both Commend me to the princes in our camp Do my good morrow to them and anon Desire them all to my pavilion We shall my liege Shall I attend your Grace No my good knight Go with my brothers to my lords of England I and my bosom must debate awhile And then I would no other company The Lord in heaven bless thee noble Harry God a mercy old heart thou speak'st cheerfully Qui va la A friend Discuss unto me art thou officer Or art thou base common and popular I am a gentleman of a company Trail'st thou the puissant pike Even so What are you As good a gentleman as the Emperor Then you are a better than the King The King 's a bawcock and a heart of gold A lad of life an imp of fame Of parents good of fist most valiant I kiss his dirty shoe and from heart string I love the lovely bully What is thy name Harry le Roy Le Roy a Cornish name art thou of Cornish crew No I am a Welshman Know'st thou Fluellen Yes Tell him I 'll knock his leek about his pate Upon Saint Davy 's day Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day lest he knock that about yours Art thou his friend And his kinsman too The figo for thee then I thank you God be with you My name is Pistol call'd Exit It sorts well with your fierceness Captain Fluellen So in the name of Jesu Christ speak fewer It is the greatest admiration in the universal world when the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the wars is not kept if you would take the pains but to examine the wars of Pompey the Great you shall find I warrant you that there is no tiddle taddle nor pibble pabble in Pompey 's camp I warrant you you shall find the ceremonies of the wars and the cares of it and the forms of it and the sobriety of it and the modesty of it to be otherwise Why the enemy is loud you hear him all night If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb is it meet think you that we should also look you be an ass and a fool and a prating coxcomb In your own conscience now I will speak lower I pray you and beseech you that you will Though it appear a little out of fashion There is much care and valour in this Welshman Brother John Bates is not that the morning which breaks yonder I think it be but we have no great cause to desire the approach of day We see yonder the beginning of the day but I think we shall never see the end of it Who goes there A friend Under what captain serve you Under Sir Thomas Erpingham A good old commander and a most kind gentleman I pray you what thinks he of our estate Even as men wreck'd upon a sand that look to be wash'd off the next tide He hath not told his thought to the King No nor it is not meet he should For though I speak it to you I think the King is but a man as I am the violet smells to him as it doth to me the element shows to him as it doth to me all his senses have but human conditions his ceremonies laid by in his nakedness he appears but a man and though his affections are higher mounted than ours yet when they stoop they stoop with the like wing Therefore when he sees reason of fears as we do his fears out of doubt be of the same relish as ours are yet in reason no man should possess him with any appearance of fear lest he by showing it should dishearten his army He may show what outward courage he will but I believe as cold a night as ' tis he could wish himself in Thames up to the neck and so I would he were and I by him at all adventures so we were quit here By my troth I will speak my conscience of the King I think he would not wish himself anywhere but where he is Then I would he were here alone so should he be sure to be ransomed and a many poor men 's lives saved I dare say you love him not so ill to wish him here alone howsoever you speak this to feel other men 's minds methinks I could not die anywhere so contented as in the King 's company his cause being just and his quarrel honourable That 's more than we know Ay or more than we should seek after for we know enough if we know we are the King 's subjects If his cause be wrong our obedience to the King wipes the crime of it out of us But if the cause be not good the King himself hath a heavy reckoning to make when all those legs and arms and heads chopp'd off in a battle shall join together at the latter day and cry all ' We died at such a place'- some swearing some crying for a surgeon some upon their wives left poor behind them some upon the debts they owe some upon their children rawly left I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle for how can they charitably dispose of anything when blood is their argument Now if these men do not die well it will be a black matter for the King that led them to it who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection So if a son that is by his father sent about merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea the imputation of his wickedness by your rule should be imposed upon his father that sent him or if a servant under his master 's command transporting a sum of money be assailed by robbers and die in many irreconcil'd iniquities you may call the business of the master the author of the servant 's damnation But this is not so the King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his soldiers the father of his son nor the master of his servant for they purpose not their death when they purpose their services Besides there is no king be his cause never so spotless if it come to the arbitrement of swords can try it out with all unspotted soldiers some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder some of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury some making the wars their bulwark that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery Now if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment though they can outstrip men they have no wings to fly from God war is His beadle war is His vengeance so that here men are punish'd for before breach of the King 's laws in now the King 's quarrel Where they feared the death they have borne life away and where they would be safe they perish Then if they die unprovided no more is the King guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited Every subject 's duty is the King 's but every subject 's soul is his own Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed- wash every mote out of his conscience and dying so death is to him advantage or not dying the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained and in him that escapes it were not sin to think that making God so free an offer He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare ' Tis certain every man that dies ill the ill upon his own head- the King is not to answer for it I do not desire he should answer for me and yet I determine to fight lustily for him I myself heard the King say he would not be ransom'd Ay he said so to make us fight cheerfully but when our throats are cut he may be ransom'd and we ne'er the wiser If I live to see it I will never trust his word after You pay him then That 's a perilous shot out of an elder gun that a poor and a private displeasure can do against a monarch You may as well go about to turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a peacock 's feather You 'll never trust his word after Come ' tis a foolish saying Your reproof is something too round I should be angry with you if the time were convenient Let it be a quarrel between us if you live I embrace it How shall I know thee again Give me any gage of thine and I will wear it in my bonnet then if ever thou dar'st acknowledge it I will make it my quarrel Here 's my glove give me another of thine There This will I also wear in my cap if ever thou come to me and say after to morrow ' This is my glove ' by this hand I will take thee a box on the ear If ever I live to see it I will challenge it Thou dar'st as well be hang'd Well I will do it though I take thee in the King 's company Keep thy word Fare thee well Be friends you English fools be friends we have French quarrels enow if you could tell how to reckon Indeed the French may lay twenty French crowns to one they will beat us for they bear them on their shoulders but it is no English treason to cut French crowns and to morrow the King himself will be a clipper My lord your nobles jealous of your absence Seek through your camp to find you Good old knight Collect them all together at my tent I 'll be before thee I shall do't my lord Exit O God of battles steel my soldiers ' hearts Possess them not with fear Take from them now The sense of reck'ning if th ' opposed numbers Pluck their hearts from them Not to day O Lord O not to day think not upon the fault My father made in compassing the crown I Richard 's body have interred new And on it have bestowed more contrite tears Than from it issued forced drops of blood Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold up Toward heaven to pardon blood and I have built Two chantries where the sad and solemn priests Sing still for Richard 's soul More will I do Though all that I can do is nothing worth Since that my penitence comes after all Imploring pardon My liege My brother Gloucester 's voice Ay I know thy errand I will go with thee The day my friends and all things stay for me Exeunt The sun doth gild our armour up my lords Montez a cheval My horse Varlet laquais Ha O brave spirit Via Les eaux et la terre- Rien puis L'air et le feu Ciel cousin Orleans Hark how our steeds for present service neigh Mount them and make incision in their hides That their hot blood may spin in English eyes And dout them with superfluous courage ha What will you have them weep our horses ' blood How shall we then behold their natural tears The English are embattl'd you French peers To horse you gallant Princes straight to horse Do but behold yon poor and starved band And your fair show shall suck away their souls Leaving them but the shales and husks of men There is not work enough for all our hands Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins To give each naked curtle axe a stain That our French gallants shall to day draw out And sheathe for lack of sport Let us but blow on them The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them ' Tis positive ' gainst all exceptions lords That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants- Who in unnecessary action swarm About our squares of battle- were enow To purge this field of such a hilding foe Though we upon this mountain 's basis by Took stand for idle speculation- But that our honours must not What 's to say A very little little let us do And all is done Then let the trumpets sound The tucket sonance and the note to mount For our approach shall so much dare the field That England shall couch down in fear and yield Why do you stay so long my lords of France Yond island carrions desperate of their bones Ill favouredly become the morning field Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose And our air shakes them passing scornfully Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks With torch staves in their hand and their poor jades Lob down their heads dropping the hides and hips The gum down roping from their pale dead eyes And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal'd bit Lies foul with chaw'd grass still and motionless And their executors the knavish crows Fly o'er them all impatient for their hour Description can not suit itself in words To demonstrate the life of such a battle In life so lifeless as it shows itself They have said their prayers and they stay for death Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits And give their fasting horses provender And after fight with them I stay but for my guidon To the field I will the banner from a trumpet take And use it for my haste Come come away The sun is high and we outwear the day Exeunt Where is the King The King himself is rode to view their battle Of fighting men they have full three score thousand There 's five to one besides they all are fresh God 's arm strike with us ' tis a fearful odds God bye you Princes all I 'll to my charge If we no more meet till we meet in heaven Then joyfully my noble Lord of Bedford My dear Lord Gloucester and my good Lord Exeter And my kind kinsman- warriors all adieu Farewell good Salisbury and good luck go with thee Farewell kind lord Fight valiantly to day And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it For thou art fram'd of the firm truth of valour He is as full of valour as of kindness Princely in both O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England That do no work to day What 's he that wishes so My cousin Westmoreland No my fair cousin If we are mark'd to die we are enow To do our country loss and if to live The fewer men the greater share of honour God 's will I pray thee wish not one man more By Jove I am not covetous for gold Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost It yearns me not if men my garments wear Such outward things dwell not in my desires But if it be a sin to covet honour I am the most offending soul alive No faith my coz wish not a man from England God 's peace I would not lose so great an honour As one man more methinks would share from me For the best hope I have O do not wish one more Rather proclaim it Westmoreland through my host That he which hath no stomach to this fight Let him depart his passport shall be made And crowns for convoy put into his purse We would not die in that man 's company That fears his fellowship to die with us This day is call'd the feast of Crispian He that outlives this day and comes safe home Will stand a tip toe when this day is nam'd And rouse him at the name of Crispian He that shall live this day and see old age Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours And say ' To morrow is Saint Crispian ' Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars And say ' These wounds I had on Crispian 's day ' Old men forget yet all shall be forgot But he 'll remember with advantages What feats he did that day Then shall our names Familiar in his mouth as household words- Harry the King Bedford and Exeter Warwick and Talbot Salisbury and Gloucester- Be in their flowing cups freshly rememb'red This story shall the good man teach his son And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by From this day to the ending of the world But we in it shall be remembered- We few we happy few we band of brothers For he to day that sheds his blood with me Shall be my brother be he ne'er so vile This day shall gentle his condition And gentlemen in England now a bed Shall think themselves accurs'd they were not here And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks That fought with us upon Saint Crispin 's day My sovereign lord bestow yourself with speed The French are bravely in their battles set And will with all expedience charge on us All things are ready if our minds be so Perish the man whose mind is backward now Thou dost not wish more help from England coz God 's will my liege would you and I alone Without more help could fight this royal battle Why now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men Which likes me better than to wish us one You know your places God be with you all Once more I come to know of thee King Harry If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound Before thy most assured overthrow For certainly thou art so near the gulf Thou needs must be englutted Besides in mercy The constable desires thee thou wilt mind Thy followers of repentance that their souls May make a peaceful and a sweet retire From off these fields where wretches their poor bodies Must lie and fester Who hath sent thee now The Constable of France I pray thee bear my former answer back Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones Good God why should they mock poor fellows thus The man that once did sell the lion 's skin While the beast liv'd was kill'd with hunting him A many of our bodies shall no doubt Find native graves upon the which I trust Shall witness live in brass of this day 's work And those that leave their valiant bones in France Dying like men though buried in your dunghills They shall be fam'd for there the sun shall greet them And draw their honours reeking up to heaven Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France Mark then abounding valour in our English That being dead like to the bullet 's grazing Break out into a second course of mischief Killing in relapse of mortality Let me speak proudly tell the Constable We are but warriors for the working day Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd With rainy marching in the painful field There 's not a piece of feather in our host- Good argument I hope we will not fly- And time hath worn us into slovenry But by the mass our hearts are in the trim And my poor soldiers tell me yet ere night They 'll be in fresher robes or they will pluck The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers ' heads And turn them out of service If they do this- As if God please they shall- my ransom then Will soon be levied Herald save thou thy labour Come thou no more for ransom gentle herald They shall have none I swear but these my joints Which if they have as I will leave 'em them Shall yield them little tell the Constable I shall King Harry And so fare thee well Thou never shalt hear herald any more Exit I fear thou wilt once more come again for a ransom My lord most humbly on my knee I beg The leading of the vaward Take it brave York Now soldiers march away And how thou pleasest God dispose the day Exeunt Yield cur Je pense

more valour than this roaring devil i ' th ' old play that every one may pare his nails with a wooden dagger and they are both hang'd and so would this be if he durst steal anything adventurously I must stay with the lackeys with the luggage of our camp The French might have a good prey of us if he knew of it for there is none to guard it but boys Exit O diable O Seigneur le jour est perdu tout est perdu Mort Dieu ma vie all is confounded all Reproach and everlasting shame Sits mocking in our plumes A short alarum O mechante fortune Do not run away Why an our ranks are broke O perdurable shame Let 's stab ourselves Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for Is this the king we sent to for his ransom Shame and eternal shame nothing but shame Let us die in honour once more back again And he that will not follow Bourbon now Let him go hence and with his cap in hand Like a base pander hold the chamber door Whilst by a slave no gender than my dog His fairest daughter is contaminated Disorder that hath spoil'd us friend us now Let us on heaps go offer up our lives We are enow yet living in the field To smother up the English in our throngs If any order might be thought upon The devil take order now I 'll to the throng Let life be short else shame will be too long Exeunt Well have we done thrice valiant countrymen But all 's not done- yet keep the French the field The Duke of York commends him to your Majesty Lives he good uncle Thrice within this hour I saw him down thrice up again and fighting From helmet to the spur all blood he was In which array brave soldier doth he lie Larding the plain and by his bloody side Yoke fellow to his honour owing wounds The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies Suffolk first died and York all haggled over Comes to him where in gore he lay insteeped And takes him by the beard kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawn upon his face He cries aloud ' Tarry my cousin Suffolk My soul shall thine keep company to heaven Tarry sweet soul for mine then fly abreast As in this glorious and well foughten field We kept together in our chivalry ' Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up He smil'd me in the face raught me his hand And with a feeble grip says ' Dear my lord Commend my service to my sovereign ' So did he turn and over Suffolk 's neck He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips And so espous'd to death with blood he seal'd A testament of noble ending love The pretty and sweet manner of it forc'd Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd But I had not so much of man in me And all my mother came into mine eyes And gave me up to tears I blame you not For hearing this I must perforce compound With mistful eyes or they will issue too Alarum But hark what new alarum is this same The French have reinforc'd their scatter'd men Then every soldier kill his prisoners Give the word through Exeunt Kill the poys and the luggage ' Tis expressly against the law of arms ' tis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offert in your conscience now is it not ' Tis certain there 's not a boy left alive and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha ' done this slaughter besides

every one So happy be the issue brother England Of this good day and of this gracious meeting As we are now glad to behold your eyes- Your eyes which hitherto have home in them Against the French that

amen to that thus we appear You English princes an I do salute you My duty to you both on equal love Great Kings of France and England That I have labour'd With all my wits my pains and strong endeavours To bring your most imperial Majesties Unto this bar and royal interview Your mightiness on both parts best can witness Since then my office hath so far prevail'd That face to face and royal eye to eye You have congreeted let it not disgrace me If I demand before this royal view What rub or what impediment there is Why that the naked poor and mangled Peace Dear nurse of arts plenties and joyful births Should not in this best garden of the world Our fertile France put up her lovely visage Alas she hath from France too long been chas'd And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps Corrupting in it own fertility Her vine the merry cheerer of the heart Unpruned dies her hedges even pleach'd Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair Put forth disorder'd twigs her fallow leas The darnel hemlock and rank fumitory Doth root upon while that the coulter rusts That should deracinate such savagery The even mead that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled cowslip burnet and green clover Wanting the scythe all uncorrected rank Conceives by idleness and nothing teems But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs Losing both beauty and utility And as our vineyards fallows meads and hedges Defective in their natures grow to wildness Even so our houses and ourselves and children Have lost or do not learn for want of time The sciences that should become our country But grow like savages- as soldiers will That nothing do but meditate on blood- To swearing and stern looks diffus'd attire And everything that seems unnatural Which to reduce into our former favout You are assembled and my speech entreats That I may know the let why gentle Peace Should not expel these inconveniences And bless us with her former qualities If Duke of Burgundy you would the peace Whose want gives growth to th ' imperfections Which you have cited you must buy that peace With full accord to all our just demands Whose tenours and particular effects You have enschedul'd briefly in your hands The King hath heard them to the which as yet There is no answer made Well then the peace Which you before so urg'd lies in his answer I have but with a cursorary eye O'erglanced the articles pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your council presently To sit with us once more with better heed To re survey them we will suddenly Pass our accept and peremptory answer Brother we shall Go uncle Exeter And brother Clarence and you brother Gloucester Warwick and Huntington go with the King And take with you free power to ratify Augment or alter as your wisdoms best Shall see advantageable for our dignity Any thing in or out of our demands And we 'll consign thereto Will you fair sister Go with the princes or stay here with us Our gracious brother I will go with them Haply a woman 's voice may do some good When articles too nicely urg'd be stood on Yet leave our cousin Katherine here with us She is our capital demand compris'd Within the fore rank of our articles She hath good leave Fair Katherine and most fair Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms Such as will enter at a lady 's ear And plead his love suit to her gentle heart Your Majesty shall mock me I can not speak your England O fair Katherine if you will love me soundly with your French heart I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue Do you like me Kate Pardonnez moi I can not tell vat is like me An angel is like you Kate and you are like an angel Que dit il que je suis semblable a les anges Oui vraiment sauf votre grace ainsi dit il I said so dear Katherine and I must not blush to affirm it O bon Dieu les langues des hommes sont pleines de tromperies What says she fair one that the tongues of men are full of deceits Oui dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits- dat is de Princess The Princess is the better English woman I ' faith Kate my wooing is fit for thy understanding I am glad thou canst speak no better English for if thou couldst thou wouldst find me such a plain king that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my crown I know no ways to mince it in love but directly to say ' I love you ' Then if you urge me farther than to say ' Do you in faith ' I wear out my suit Give me your answer i ' faith do and so clap hands and a bargain How say you lady Sauf votre honneur me understand well Marry if you would put me to verses or to dance for your sake Kate why you undid me for the one I have neither words nor measure and for the other I have no strength in measure yet a reasonable measure in strength If I could win a lady at leap frog or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back under the correction of bragging be it spoken I should quickly leap into wife Or if I might buffet for my love or bound my horse for her favours I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack an apes never off But before God Kate I can not look greenly nor gasp out my cloquence nor I have no cunning in protestation only downright oaths which I never use till urg'd nor never break for urging If thou canst love a fellow of this temper Kate whose face is not worth sunburning that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there let thine eye be thy cook I speak to thee plain soldier If thou canst love me for this take me if not to say to thee that I shall die is true- but for thy love by the Lord no yet I love thee too And while thou liv'st dear Kate take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy for he perforce must do thee right because he hath not the gift to woo in other places for these fellows of infinite tongue that can rhyme themselves into ladies ' favours they do always reason themselves out again What a speaker is but a prater a rhyme is but a ballad A good leg will fall a straight back will stoop a black beard will turn white a curl'd pate will grow bald a fair face will wither a full eye will wax hollow But a good heart Kate is the sun and the moon or rather the sun and not the moon- for it shines bright and never changes but keeps his course truly If thou would have such a one take me and take me take a soldier take a soldier take a king And what say'st thou then to my love Speak my fair and fairly I pray thee Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine And Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine I can not tell vat is dat No Kate I will tell thee in French which I am sure will hang upon my tongue like a new married wife about her husband 's neck hardly to be shook off Je quand sur le possession de France et quand vous avez le possession de moi- let me see what then Saint Denis be my speed!- donc votre est France et vous etes mienne It is as easy for me Kate to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much more French I shall never move thee in French unless it be to laugh at me Sauf votre honneur le Francais que vous parlez il est meilleur que l'Anglais lequel je parle No faith is't not Kate but thy speaking of my tongue and I thine most truly falsely must needs be granted to be much at one But Kate dost thou understand thus much English- Canst thou love me I can not tell Can any of your neighbours tell Kate I 'll ask them Come I know thou lovest me and at night when you come into your closet you 'll question this gentlewoman about me and I know Kate you will to her dispraise those parts in me that you love with your heart But good Kate mock me mercifully the rather gentle Princess because I love thee cruelly If ever thou beest mine Kate as I have a saving faith within me tells me thou shalt I get thee with scambling and thou must therefore needs prove a good soldier breeder Shall not thou and I between Saint Denis and Saint George compound a boy half French half English that shall go to Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard Shall we not What say'st thou my fair flower de luce I do not know dat No ' tis hereafter to know but now to promise do but now promise Kate you will endeavour for your French part of such a boy and for my English moiety take the word of a king and a bachelor How answer you la plus belle Katherine du monde mon Your Majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de most sage damoiselle dat is en France Now fie upon my false French By mine honour in true English I love thee Kate by which honour I dare not swear thou lovest me yet my blood begins to flatter me that thou dost notwithstanding the poor and untempering effect of my visage Now beshrew my father 's ambition He was thinking of civil wars when he got me therefore was I created with a stubborn outside with an aspect of iron that when I come to woo ladies I fright them But in faith Kate the elder I wax the better I shall appear my comfort is that old age that in layer up of beauty can do no more spoil upon my face thou hast me if thou hast me at the worst and thou shalt wear me if thou wear me better and better And therefore tell me most fair Katherine will you have me Put off your maiden blushes avouch the thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress take me by the hand and say ' Harry of England I am thine ' Which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine ear withal but I will tell thee aloud ' England is thine Ireland is thine France is thine and Henry Plantagenet is thine ' who though I speak it before his face if he be not fellow with the best king thou shalt find the best king of good fellows Come your answer in broken music- for thy voice is music and thy English broken therefore Queen of all Katherine break thy mind to me in broken English wilt thou have me Dat is as it shall please de roi mon pere Nay it will please him well Kate- it shall please him Kate Den it sall also content me Upon that I kiss your hand and I can you my queen Laissez mon seigneur laissez laissez Ma foi je ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en baisant la main d'une notre seigneur indigne serviteur excusez moi je vous supplie mon tres puissant seigneur Then I will kiss your lips Kate Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant leur noces il n'est pas la coutume de France Madame my interpreter what says she Dat it is not be de fashion pour le ladies of France- I can not tell vat is baiser en Anglish To kiss Your Majestee entendre bettre que moi It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss before they are married would she say Oui vraiment O Kate nice customs curtsy to great kings Dear Kate you and I can not be confin'd within the weak list of a country 's fashion we are the makers of manners Kate and the liberty that follows our places stops the mouth of all find faults- as I will do yours for upholding the nice fashion of your country in denying me a kiss therefore patiently and yielding Kissing her You have witchcraft in your lips Kate there is more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the tongues of the French council and they should sooner persuade Henry of England than a general petition of monarchs Here comes your father God save your Majesty My royal cousin Teach you our princess English I would have her learn my fair cousin how perfectly I love her and that is good English Is she not apt Our tongue is rough coz and my condition is not smooth so that having neither the voice nor the heart of flattery about me I can not so conjure up the spirit of love in her that he will appear in his true likeness Pardon the frankness of my mirth if I answer you for that If you would conjure in her you must make a circle if conjure up love in her in his true likeness he must appear naked and blind Can you blame her then being a maid yet ros'd over with the virgin crimson of modesty if she deny the appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing self It were my lord a hard condition for a maid to consign to Yet they do wink and yield as love is blind and enforces They are then excus'd my lord when they see not what they do Then good my lord teach your cousin to consent winking I will wink on her to consent my lord if you will teach her to know my meaning for maids well summer'd and warm kept are like flies at Bartholomew tide blind though they have their eyes and then they will endure handling which before would not abide looking on This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer and so I shall catch the fly your cousin in the latter end and she must be blind too As love is my lord before it loves It is so and you may some of you thank love for my blindness who can not see many a fair French city for one fair French maid that stands in my way Yes my lord you see them perspectively the cities turned into a maid for they are all girdled with maiden walls that war hath never ent'red Shall Kate be my wife So please you I am content so the maiden cities you talk of may wait on her so the maid that stood in the way for my wish shall show me the way to my will We have consented to all terms of reason Is't so my lords of England The king hath granted every article His daughter first and then in sequel all According to their firm proposed natures Only he hath not yet subscribed this Nor this I have not brother so denied But our request shall make me let it pass I pray you then in love and dear alliance Let that one article rank with the rest And thereupon give me your daughter Take her fair son and from her blood raise up Issue to me that the contending kingdoms Of France and England whose very shores look pale With envy of each other 's happiness May cease their hatred and this dear conjunction Plant neighbourhood and Christian like accord In their sweet bosoms that never war advance His bleeding sword ' twixt England and fair France Amen Now welcome Kate and bear me witness all That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen Floulish God the best maker of all marriages Combine your hearts in one your realms in one As man and wife being two are one in love So be there ' twixt your kingdoms such a spousal That never may ill office or fell jealousy Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms To make divorce of their incorporate league That English may as French French Englishmen Receive each other God speak this Amen Amen Prepare we for our marriage on which day My Lord of Burgundy we 'll take your oath And all the peers ' for surety of our leagues Then shall I swear to Kate and you to me And may our oaths well kept and prosp'rous be Thus far with rough and all unable pen Our bending author hath pursu'd the story In little room confining mighty men Mangling by starts the full course of their glory Small time but in that small most greatly lived This star of England Fortune made his sword By which the world 's best garden he achieved And of it left his son imperial lord Henry the Sixth in infant bands crown'd king Of France and England did this king succeed Whose state so many had the managing That they lost France and made his England bleed Which oft our stage hath shown and for their sake In your fair minds let this acceptance take Exit Hung be the heavens with black yield day to night Comets importing change of times and states Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky And with them scourge the bad revolting stars That have consented unto Henry 's death King Henry the Fifth too famous to live long England ne'er lost a king of so much worth England ne'er had a king until his time Virtue he had deserving to command His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams His arms spread wider than a dragon 's wings His sparkling eyes replete with wrathful fire More dazzled and drove back his enemies Than mid day sun fierce bent against their faces What should I say His deeds exceed all speech He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered We mourn in black why mourn we not in blood Henry is dead and never shall revive Upon a wooden coffin we attend And death 's dishonourable victory We with our stately presence glorify Like captives bound to a triumphant car What shall we curse the planets of mishap That plotted thus our glory 's overthrow Or shall we think the subtle witted French Conjurers and sorcerers that afraid of him By magic verses have contriv'd his end He was a king bless'd of the King of kings Unto the French the dreadful judgment day So dreadful will not be as was his sight The battles of the Lord of Hosts he fought The Church 's prayers made him so prosperous The Church Where is it Had not churchmen pray'd His thread of life had not so soon decay'd None do you like but an effeminate prince Whom like a school boy you may overawe Gloucester whate'er we like thou art Protector And lookest to command the Prince and realm Thy wife is proud she holdeth thee in awe More than God or religious churchmen may Name not religion for thou lov'st the flesh And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st Except it be to pray against thy foes Cease cease these jars and rest your minds in peace Let 's to the altar Heralds wait on us Instead of gold we 'll offer up our arms Since arms avail not now that Henry 's dead Posterity await for wretched years When at their mothers ' moist'ned eyes babes shall suck Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears And none but women left to wail the dead My honourable lords health to you all Sad tidings bring I to you out of France Of loss of slaughter and discomfiture Guienne Champagne Rheims Orleans Paris Guysors Poictiers are all quite lost What say'st thou man before dead Henry 's corse Speak softly or the loss of those great towns Will make him burst his lead and rise from death Is Paris lost Is Rouen yielded up If Henry were recall'd to life again These news would cause him once more yield the ghost How were they lost What treachery was us'd No treachery but want of men and money Amongst the soldiers this is muttered That here you maintain several factions And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought You are disputing of your generals One would have ling'ring wars with little cost Another would fly swift but wanteth wings A third thinks without expense at all By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd Awake awake English nobility Let not sloth dim your honours new begot Cropp'd are the flower de luces in your arms Of England 's coat one half is cut away Were our tears wanting to this funeral These tidings would call forth their flowing tides Me they concern Regent I am of France Give me my steeled coat I 'll fight for France Away with these disgraceful wailing robes Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes To weep their intermissive miseries Lords view these letters full of bad mischance France is revolted from the English quite Except some petty towns of no import The Dauphin Charles is crowned king in Rheims The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd Reignier Duke of Anjou doth take his part The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side The Dauphin crowned king all fly to him O whither shall we fly from this reproach We will not fly but to our enemies ' throats Bedford if thou be slack I 'll fight it out Gloucester why doubt'st thou of my forwardness An army have I muster'd in my thoughts Wherewith already France is overrun My gracious lords to add to your laments Wherewith you now bedew King Henry 's hearse I must inform you of a dismal fight Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French What Wherein Talbot overcame Is't so O no wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown The circumstance I 'll tell you more at large The tenth of August last this dreadful lord Retiring from the siege of Orleans Having full scarce six thousand in his troop By three and twenty thousand of the French Was round encompassed and set upon No leisure had he to enrank his men He wanted pikes to set before his archers Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges They pitched in the ground confusedly To keep the horsemen off from breaking in More than three hours the fight continued Where valiant Talbot above human thought Enacted wonders with his sword and lance Hundreds he sent to hell and none durst stand him Here there and everywhere enrag'd he slew The French exclaim'd the devil was in arms All the whole army stood agaz'd on him His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit ' A Talbot a Talbot ' cried out amain And rush'd into the bowels of the battle Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward He being in the vaward plac'd behind With purpose to relieve and follow them- Cowardly fled not having struck one stroke Hence grew the general wreck and massacre Enclosed were they with their enemies A base Walloon to win the Dauphin 's grace Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back Whom all France with their chief assembled strength Durst not presume to look once in the face Is Talbot slain Then I will slay myself For living idly here in pomp and ease Whilst such a worthy leader wanting aid Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd O no he lives but is took prisoner And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise His ransom there is none but I shall pay I 'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne His crown shall be the ransom of my friend Four of their lords I 'll change for one of ours Farewell my masters to my task will I Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make To keep our great Saint George 's feast withal Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take Whose bloody deeds shall make an Europe quake So you had need for Orleans is besieg'd The English army is grown weak and faint The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply And hardly keeps his men from mutiny Since they so few watch such a multitude Remember lords your oaths to Henry sworn Either to quell the Dauphin utterly Or bring him in obedience to your yoke I do remember it and here take my leave To go about my preparation Exit I 'll to the Tower with all the haste I can To view th ' artillery and munition And then I will proclaim young Henry king Exit To Eltham will I where the young King is Being ordain'd his special governor And for his safety there I 'll best devise Exit Aside Each hath his place and function to attend I am left out for me nothing remains But long I will not be Jack out of office The King from Eltham I intend to steal And sit at chiefest stern of public weal Exeunt Mars his true moving even as in the heavens So in the earth to this day is not known Late did he shine upon the English side Now we are victors upon us he smiles What towns of any moment but we have At pleasure here we lie near Orleans Otherwhiles the famish'd English like pale ghosts Faintly besiege us one hour in a month They want their porridge and their fat bull beeves Either they must be dieted like mules And have their provender tied to their mouths Or piteous they will look like drowned mice Let 's raise the siege Why live we idly here Talbot is taken whom we wo nt to fear Remaineth none but mad brain'd Salisbury And he may well in fretting spend his gall Nor men nor money hath he to make war Sound sound alarum we will rush on them Now for the honour of the forlorn French Him I forgive my death that killeth me When he sees me go back one foot or flee Exeunt Who ever saw the like What men have I Dogs cowards dastards I would ne'er have fled But that they left me midst my enemies Salisbury is a desperate homicide He fighteth as one weary of his life The other lords like lions wanting food Do rush upon us as their hungry prey Froissart a countryman of ours records England all Olivers and Rowlands bred During the time Edward the Third did reign More truly now may this be verified For none but Samsons and Goliases It sendeth forth to skirmish One to ten Lean raw bon'd rascals Who would e'er suppose They had such courage and audacity Let 's leave this town for they are hare brain'd slaves And hunger will enforce them to be more eager Of old I know them rather with their teeth The walls they 'll tear down than forsake the siege I think by some odd gimmers or device Their arms are set like clocks still to strike on Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do By my consent we 'll even let them alone Be it so Where 's the Prince Dauphin I have news for him Bastard of Orleans thrice welcome to us Methinks your looks are sad your cheer appall'd Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence Be not dismay'd for succour is at hand A holy maid hither with me I bring Which by a vision sent to her from heaven Ordained is to raise this tedious siege And drive the English forth the bounds of France The spirit of deep prophecy she hath Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome What 's past and what 's to come she can descry Speak shall I call her in Believe my words For they are certain and unfallible Go call her in Exit BASTARD But first to try her skill Reignier stand thou as Dauphin in my place Question her proudly let thy looks be stern By this means shall we sound what skill she hath Fair maid is ' t thou wilt do these wondrous feats Reignier is ' t thou that thinkest to beguile me Where is the Dauphin Come come from behind I know thee well though never seen before Be not amaz'd there 's nothing hid from me In private will I talk with thee apart Stand back you lords and give us leave awhile She takes upon her bravely at first dash Dauphin I am by birth a shepherd 's daughter My wit untrain'd in any kind of art Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleas'd To shine on my contemptible estate Lo whilst I waited on my tender lambs And to sun 's parching heat display'd my cheeks God 's Mother deigned to appear to me And in a vision full of majesty Will'd me to leave my base vocation And free my country from calamity Her aid she promis'd and assur'd success In complete glory she reveal'd herself And whereas I was black and swart before With those clear rays which she infus'd on me That beauty am I bless'd with which you may see Ask me what question thou canst possible And I will answer unpremeditated My courage try by combat if thou dar'st And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex Resolve on this thou shalt be fortunate If thou receive me for thy warlike mate Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms Only this proof I 'll of thy valour make In single combat thou shalt buckle with me And if thou vanquishest thy words are true Otherwise I renounce all confidence I am prepar'd here is my keen edg'd sword Deck'd with five flower de luces on each side The which at Touraine in Saint Katherine 's churchyard Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth Then come o ' God 's name I fear no woman And while I live I 'll ne'er fly from a man Stay stay thy hands thou art an Amazon And fightest with the sword of Deborah Christ 's Mother helps me else I were too weak Whoe'er helps thee ' tis thou that must help me Impatiently I burn with thy desire My heart and hands thou hast at once subdu'd Excellent Pucelle if thy name be so Let me thy servant and not sovereign be ' Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus I must not yield to any rites of love For my profession 's sacred from above When I have chased all thy foes from hence Then will I think upon a recompense Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall My lord methinks is very long in talk Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech Shall we disturb him since he keeps no mean He may mean more than we poor men do know These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues My lord where are you What devise you on Shall we give o'er Orleans or no Why no I say distrustful recreants Fight till the last gasp I will be your guard What she says I 'll confirm we 'll fight it out Assign'd am I to be the English scourge This night the siege assuredly I 'll raise Expect Saint Martin 's summer halcyon days Since I have entered into these wars Glory is like a circle in the water Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought With Henry 's death the English circle ends Dispersed are the glories it included Now am I like that proud insulting ship Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once Was Mahomet inspired with a dove Thou with an eagle art inspired then Helen the mother of great Constantine Nor yet Saint Philip 's daughters were like thee Bright star of Venus fall'n down on the earth How may I reverently worship thee enough Leave off delays and let us raise the siege Woman do what thou canst to save our honours Drive them from Orleans and be immortaliz'd Presently we 'll try Come let 's away about it No prophet will I trust if she prove false Exeunt I am come to survey the Tower this day Since Henry 's death I fear there is conveyance Where be these warders that they wait not here Open the gates ' tis Gloucester that calls Within Who 's there that knocks so imperiously Within Whoe'er he be you may not be let in Within The Lord protect him so we answer him We do no otherwise than we are will'd Who willed you or whose will stands but mine There 's none Protector of the realm but I. Break up the gates I 'll be your warrantize Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms Within What noise is this What traitors have we here Lieutenant is it you whose voice I hear Open the gates here 's Gloucester that would enter Within Have patience noble Duke I may not open The Cardinal of Winchester forbids From him I have express commandment That thou nor none of thine shall be let in Faint hearted Woodville prizest him fore me Arrogant Winchester that haughty prelate Whom Henry our late sovereign ne'er could brook Thou art no friend to God or to the King Open the gates or I 'll shut thee out shortly How now ambitious Humphry What means this Peel'd priest dost thou command me to be shut out I do thou most usurping proditor And not Protector of the King or realm Stand back thou manifest conspirator Thou that contrived'st to murder our dead lord Thou that giv'st whores indulgences to sin I 'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal 's hat If thou proceed in this thy insolence Nay stand thou back I will not budge a foot This be Damascus be thou cursed Cain To slay thy brother Abel if thou wilt I will not slay thee but I 'll drive thee back Thy scarlet robes as a child 's bearing cloth I 'll use to carry thee out of this place Do what thou dar'st I beard thee to thy face What am I dar'd and bearded to my face Draw men for all this privileged place Blue coats to tawny coats Priest beware your beard I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal 's hat In spite of Pope or dignities of church Here by the cheeks I 'll drag thee up and down Gloucester thou wilt answer this before the Pope Winchester goose I cry ' A rope a rope ' Now beat them hence why do you let them stay Thee I 'll chase hence thou wolf in sheep 's array Out tawny coats Out scarlet hypocrite Fie lords that you being supreme magistrates Thus contumeliously should break the peace Peace Mayor thou know'st little of my wrongs Here 's Beaufort that regards nor God nor King Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use Here 's Gloucester a foe to citizens One that still motions war and never peace O'ercharging your free purses with large fines That seeks to overthrow religion Because he is Protector of the realm And would have armour here out of the Tower To crown himself King and suppress the Prince I Will not answer thee with words but blows Nought rests for me in this tumultuous strife But to make open proclamation Come officer as loud as e'er thou canst Cry Cries All manner of men assembled here in arms this day against God 's peace and the King 's we charge and command you in his Highness ' name to repair to your several dwelling places and not to wear handle or use any sword weapon or dagger henceforward upon pain of death Cardinal I 'll be no breaker of the law But we shall meet and break our minds at large Gloucester we 'll meet to thy cost be sure Thy heart blood I will have for this day 's work I 'll call for clubs if you will not away This Cardinal 's more haughty than the devil Mayor farewell thou dost but what thou mayst Abominable Gloucester guard thy head For I intend to have it ere long See the coast clear'd and then we will depart Good God these nobles should such stomachs bear I myself fight not once in forty year Exeunt Father I know and oft have shot at them Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim Father I warrant you take you no care I 'll never trouble you if I may spy them Exit Talbot my life my joy again return'd How wert thou handled being prisoner Or by what means got'st thou to be releas'd Discourse I prithee on this turret 's top The Earl of Bedford had a prisoner Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles For him was I exchang'd and ransomed But with a baser man of arms by far Once in contempt they would have barter'd me Which I disdaining scorn'd and craved death Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd In fine redeem'd I was as I desir'd But O the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart Whom with my bare fists I would execute If I now had him brought into my power Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts In open market place produc'd they me To be a public spectacle to all Here said they is the terror of the French The scarecrow that affrights our children so Then broke I from the officers that led me And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground To hurl at the beholders of my shame My grisly countenance made others fly None durst come near for fear of sudden death In iron walls they deem'd me not secure So great fear of my name ' mongst them was spread That they suppos'd I could rend bars of steel And spurn in pieces posts of adamant Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had That walk'd about me every minute while And if I did but stir out of my bed Ready they were to shoot me to the heart I grieve to hear what torments you endur'd But we will be reveng'd sufficiently Now it is supper time in Orleans Here through this grate I count each one And view the Frenchmen how they fortify Let us look in the sight will much delight thee Sir Thomas Gargrave and Sir William Glansdale Let me have your express opinions Where is best place to make our batt'ry next I think at the North Gate for there stand lords And I here at the bulwark of the bridge For aught I see this city must be famish'd Or with light skirmishes enfeebled O Lord have mercy on us wretched sinners O Lord have mercy on me woeful man What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us Speak Salisbury at least if thou canst speak How far'st thou mirror of all martial men One of thy eyes and thy cheek 's side struck off Accursed tower accursed fatal hand That hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars Whilst any trump did sound or drum struck up His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field Yet liv'st thou Salisbury Though thy speech doth fail One eye thou hast to look to heaven for grace The sun with one eye vieweth all the world Heaven be thou gracious to none alive If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands Bear hence his body I will help to bury it Sir Thomas Gargrave hast thou any life Speak unto Talbot nay look up to him Salisbury cheer thy spirit with this comfort Thou shalt not die whiles He beckons with his hand and smiles on me As who should say ' When I am dead and gone Remember to avenge me on the French ' Plantagenet I will and like thee Nero Play on the lute beholding the towns burn Wretched shall France be only in my name My lord my lord the French have gather'd head The Dauphin with one Joan la Pucelle join'd A holy prophetess new risen up Is come with a great power to raise the siege Hear hear how dying Salisbury doth groan It irks his heart he can not be reveng'd Frenchmen I 'll be a Salisbury to you Pucelle or puzzel dolphin or dogfish Your hearts I 'll stamp out with my horse 's heels And make a quagmire of your mingled brains Convey me Salisbury into his tent And then we 'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare Where is my strength my valour and my force Our English troops retire I can not stay them A woman clad in armour chaseth them Come come ' tis only I that must disgrace thee Heavens can you suffer hell so to prevail My breast I 'll burst with straining of my courage And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder But I will chastise this high minded strumpet Talbot farewell thy hour is not yet come I must go victual Orleans forthwith My thoughts are whirled like a potter 's wheel I know not where I am nor what I do A witch by fear not force like Hannibal Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench Are from their hives and houses driven away They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs Now like to whelps we crying run away Advance our waving colours on the walls Rescu'd is Orleans from the English Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word Divinest creature Astraea 's daughter How shall I honour thee for this success Thy promises are like Adonis ' gardens That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next France triumph in thy glorious prophetess Recover'd is the town of Orleans More blessed hap did ne'er befall our state Why ring not out the bells aloud throughout the town Dauphin command the citizens make bonfires And feast and banquet in the open streets To celebrate the joy that God hath given us All France will be replete with mirth and joy When they shall hear how we have play'd the men ' Tis Joan not we by whom the day is won For which I will divide my crown with her And all the priests and friars in my realm Shall in procession sing her endless praise A statelier pyramis to her I 'll rear Than Rhodope 's of Memphis ever was In memory of her when she is dead Her ashes in an urn more precious Than the rich jewel'd coffer of Darius Transported shall be at high festivals Before the kings and queens of France No longer on Saint Denis will we cry But Joan la Pucelle shall be France 's saint Come in and let us banquet royally After this golden day of victory Flourish Exeunt Sirs take your places and be vigilant If any noise or soldier you perceive Near to the walls by some apparent sign Let us have knowledge at the court of guard Sergeant you shall Exit SERGEANT Thus are poor servitors When others sleep upon their quiet beds Constrain'd to watch in darkness rain and cold Lord Regent and redoubted Burgundy By whose approach the regions of Artois Wallon and Picardy are friends to us This happy night the Frenchmen are secure Having all day carous'd and banqueted Embrace we then this opportunity As fitting best to quittance their deceit Contriv'd by art and baleful sorcery Coward of France how much he wrongs his fame Despairing of his own arm 's fortitude To join with witches and the help of hell Traitors have never other company But what 's that Pucelle whom they term so pure A maid they say A maid and be so martial Pray God she prove not masculine ere long If underneath the standard of the French She carry armour as she hath begun Well let them practise and converse with spirits God is our fortress in whose conquering name Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks Ascend brave Talbot we will follow thee Not all together better far I guess That we do make our entrance several ways That if it chance the one of us do fail The other yet may rise against their force Agreed I 'll to yond corner And I to this And here will Talbot mount or make his grave Now Salisbury for thee and for the right Of English Henry shall this night appear How much in duty I am bound to both How now my lords What all unready so Unready Ay and glad we ' scap'd so well ' Twas time I trow to wake and leave our beds Hearing alarums at our chamber doors Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise More venturous or desperate than this I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell If not of hell the heavens sure favour him Here cometh Charles I marvel how he sped Tut holy Joan was his defensive guard Is this thy cunning thou deceitful dame Didst thou at first to flatter us withal Make us partakers of a little gain That now our loss might be ten times so much Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend At all times will you have my power alike Sleeping or waking must I still prevail Or will you blame and lay the fault on me Improvident soldiers Had your watch been good This sudden mischief never could have fall'n Duke of Alencon this was your default That being captain of the watch to night Did look no better to that weighty charge Had all your quarters been as safely kept As that whereof I had the government We had not been thus shamefully surpris'd Mine was secure And so was mine my lord And for myself most part of all this night Within her quarter and mine own precinct I was employ'd in passing to and fro About relieving of the sentinels Then how or which way should they first break in Question my lords no further of the case How or which way ' tis sure they found some place But weakly guarded where the breach was made And now there rests no other shift but this To gather our soldiers scatter'd and dispers'd And lay new platforms to endamage them I 'll be so bold to take what they have left The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword For I have loaden me with many spoils Using no other weapon but his name Exit The day begins to break and night is fled Whose pitchy mantle over veil'd the earth Here sound retreat and cease our hot pursuit Bring forth the body of old Salisbury And here advance it in the market place The middle centre of this cursed town Now have I paid my vow unto his soul For every drop of blood was drawn from him There hath at least five Frenchmen died to night And that hereafter ages may behold What ruin happened in revenge of him Within their chiefest temple I 'll erect A tomb wherein his corpse shall be interr'd Upon the which that every one may read Shall be engrav'd the sack of Orleans The treacherous manner of his mournful death And what a terror he had been to France But lords in all our bloody massacre I muse we met not with the Dauphin 's grace His new come champion virtuous Joan of Arc Nor any of his false confederates ' Tis thought Lord Talbot when the fight began Rous'd on the sudden from their drowsy beds They did amongst the troops of armed men Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field Myself as far as I could well discern For smoke and dusky vapours of the night Am sure I scar'd the Dauphin and his trull When arm in arm they both came swiftly running Like to a pair of loving turtle doves That could not live asunder day or night After that things are set in order here We 'll follow them with all the power we have All hail my lords Which of this princely train Call ye the warlike Talbot for his acts So much applauded through the realm of France Here is the Talbot who would speak with him The virtuous lady Countess of Auvergne With modesty admiring thy renown By me entreats great lord thou wouldst vouchsafe To visit her poor castle where she lies That she may boast she hath beheld the man Whose glory fills the world with loud report Is it even so Nay then I see our wars Will turn into a peaceful comic sport When ladies crave to be encount'red with You may not my lord despise her gentle suit Ne'er trust me then for when a world of men Could not prevail with all their oratory Yet hath a woman 's kindness overrul'd And therefore tell her I return great thanks And in submission will attend on her Will not your honours bear me company No truly ' tis more than manners will And I have heard it said unbidden guests Are often welcomest when they are gone Well then alone since there 's no remedy I mean to prove this lady 's courtesy Come hither Captain Whispers You perceive my mind I do my lord and mean accordingly Exeunt Porter remember what I gave in charge And when you have done so bring the keys to me Madam I will The plot is laid if all things fall out right I shall as famous be by this exploit As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus ' death Great is the rumour of this dreadful knight And his achievements of no less account Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears To give their censure of these rare reports Madam according as your ladyship desir'd By message crav'd so is Lord Talbot come And he is welcome What is this the man Madam it is Is this the scourge of France Is this Talbot so much fear'd abroad That with his name the mothers still their babes I see report is fabulous and false I thought I should have seen some Hercules A second Hector for his grim aspect And large proportion of his strong knit limbs Alas this is a child a silly dwarf It can not be this weak and writhled shrimp Should strike such terror to his enemies Madam I have been bold to trouble you But since your ladyship is not at leisure I 'll sort some other time to visit you Going What means he now Go ask him whither he goes Stay my Lord Talbot for my lady craves To know the cause of your abrupt departure Marry for that she 's in a wrong belief I go to certify her Talbot 's here If thou be he then art thou prisoner Prisoner To whom To me blood thirsty lord And for that cause I train'd thee to my house Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me For in my gallery thy picture hangs But now the substance shall endure the like And I will chain these legs and arms of thine That hast by tyranny these many years Wasted our country slain our citizens And sent our sons and husbands captivate Ha ha ha Laughest thou wretch Thy mirth shall turn to moan I laugh to see your ladyship so fond To think that you have aught but Talbot 's shadow Whereon to practise your severity Why art not thou the man I am indeed Then have I substance too No no I am but shadow of myself You are deceiv'd my substance is not here For what you see is but the smallest part And least proportion of humanity I tell you madam were the whole frame here It is of such a spacious lofty pitch Your roof were not sufficient to contain ' t. This is a riddling merchant for the nonce He will be here and yet he is not here How can these contrarieties agree That will I show you presently Victorious Talbot pardon my abuse I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gathered by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath For I am sorry that with reverence I did not entertain thee as thou art Be not dismay'd fair lady nor misconster The mind of Talbot as you did mistake The outward composition of his body What you have done hath not offended me Nor other satisfaction do I crave But only with your patience that we may Taste of your wine and see what cates you have For soldiers ' stomachs always serve them well With all my heart and think me honoured To feast so great a warrior in my house Exeunt Great lords and gentlemen what means this silence Dare no man answer in a case of truth Within the Temple Hall we were too loud The garden here is more convenient Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth Or else was wrangling Somerset in th ' error Faith I have been a truant in the law And never yet could frame my will to it And therefore frame the law unto my will Judge you my Lord of Warwick then between us Between two hawks which flies the higher pitch Between two dogs which hath the deeper mouth Between two blades which bears the better temper Between two horses which doth bear him best Between two girls which hath the merriest eye I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgment But in these nice sharp quillets of the law Good faith I am no wiser than a daw Tut tut here is a mannerly forbearance The truth appears so naked on my side That any purblind eye may find it out And on my side it is so well apparell'd So clear so shining and so evident That it will glimmer through a blind man 's eye Since you are tongue tied and so loath to speak In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts Let him that is a true born gentleman And stands upon the honour of his birth If he suppose that I have pleaded truth From off this brier pluck a white rose with me Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer But dare maintain the party of the truth Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me I love no colours and without all colour Of base insinuating flattery I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet I pluck this red rose with young Somerset And say withal I think he held the right Stay lords and gentlemen and pluck no more Till you conclude that he upon whose side The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree Shall yield the other in the right opinion Good Master Vernon it is well objected If I have fewest I subscribe in silence And I. Then for the truth and plainness of the case I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here Giving my verdict on the white rose side Prick not your finger as you pluck it off Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red And fall on my side so against your will If I my lord for my opinion bleed Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt And keep me on the side where still I am Well well come on who else To Somerset Unless my study and my books be false The argument you held was wrong in you In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too Now Somerset where is your argument Here in my scabbard meditating that Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses For pale they look with fear as witnessing The truth on our side No Plantagenet ' Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error Hath not thy rose a canker Somerset Hath not thy rose a thorn Plantagenet Ay sharp and piercing to maintain his truth Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood Well I 'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses That shall maintain what I have said is true Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen Now by this maiden blossom in my hand I scorn thee and thy fashion peevish boy Turn not thy scorns this way Plantagenet Proud Pole I will and scorn both him and thee I 'll turn my part thereof into thy throat Away away good William de la Pole We grace the yeoman by conversing with him Now by God 's will thou wrong'st him Somerset His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence Third son to the third Edward King of England Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root He bears him on the place 's privilege Or durst not for his craven heart say thus By Him that made me I 'll maintain my words On any plot of ground in Christendom Was not thy father Richard Earl of Cambridge For treason executed in our late king 's days And by his treason stand'st not thou attainted Corrupted and exempt from ancient gentry His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood And till thou be restor'd thou art a yeoman My father was attached not attainted Condemn'd to die for treason but no traitor And that I 'll prove on better men than Somerset Were growing time once ripened to my will For your partaker Pole and you yourself I 'll note you in my book of memory To scourge you for this apprehension Look to it well and say you are well warn'd Ay thou shalt find us ready for thee still And know us by these colours for thy foes For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear And by my soul this pale and angry rose As cognizance of my blood drinking hate Will I for ever and my faction wear Until it wither with me to my grave Or flourish to the height of my degree Go forward and be chok'd with thy ambition And so farewell until I meet thee next Exit Have with thee Pole Farewell ambitious Richard Exit How I am brav'd and must perforce endure it This blot that they object against your house Shall be wip'd out in the next Parliament Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester And if thou be not then created York I will not live to be accounted Warwick Meantime in signal of my love to thee Against proud Somerset and William Pole Will I upon thy party wear this rose And here I prophesy this brawl to day Grown to this faction in the Temple Garden Shall send between the Red Rose and the White A thousand souls to death and deadly night Good Master Vernon I am bound to you That you on my behalf would pluck a flower In your behalf still will I wear the same And so will I. Thanks gentle sir Come let us four to dinner I dare say This quarrel will drink blood another day Exeunt Kind keepers of my weak decaying age Let dying Mortimer here rest himself Even like a man new haled from the rack So fare my limbs with long imprisonment And these grey locks the pursuivants of death Nestor like aged in an age of care Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer These eyes like lamps whose wasting oil is spent Wax dim as drawing to their exigent Weak shoulders overborne with burdening grief And pithless arms like to a withered vine That droops his sapless branches to the ground Yet are these feet whose strengthless stay is numb Unable to support this lump of clay Swift winged with desire to get a grave As witting I no other comfort have But tell me keeper will my nephew come Richard Plantagenet my lord will come We sent unto the Temple unto his chamber And answer was return'd that he will come Enough my soul shall then be satisfied Poor gentleman his wrong doth equal mine Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign Before whose glory I was great in arms This loathsome sequestration have I had And even since then hath Richard been obscur'd Depriv'd of honour and inheritance But now the arbitrator of despairs Just Death kind umpire of men 's miseries With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence I would his troubles likewise were expir'd That so he might recover what was lost My lord your loving nephew now is come Richard Plantagenet my friend is he come Ay noble uncle thus ignobly us'd Your nephew late despised Richard comes Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck And in his bosom spend my latter gasp O tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks That I may kindly give one fainting kiss And now declare sweet stem from York 's great stock Why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd First lean thine aged back against mine arm And in that ease I 'll tell thee my disease This day in argument upon a case Some words there grew ' twixt Somerset and me Among which terms he us'd his lavish tongue And did upbraid me with my father 's death Which obloquy set bars before my tongue Else with the like I had requited him Therefore good uncle for my father 's sake In honour of a true Plantagenet And for alliance sake declare the cause My father Earl of Cambridge lost his head That cause fair nephew that imprison'd me And hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth Within a loathsome dungeon there to pine Was cursed instrument of his decease Discover more at large what cause that was For I am ignorant and can not guess I will if that my fading breath permit And death approach not ere my tale be done Henry the Fourth grandfather to this king Depos'd his nephew Richard Edward 's son The first begotten and the lawful heir Of Edward king the third of that descent During whose reign the Percies of the north Finding his usurpation most unjust Endeavour'd my advancement to the throne The reason mov'd these warlike lords to this Was for that young Richard thus remov'd Leaving no heir begotten of his body- I was the next by birth and parentage For by my mother I derived am From Lionel Duke of Clarence third son To King Edward the Third whereas he From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree Being but fourth of that heroic line But mark as in this haughty great attempt They laboured to plant the rightful heir I lost my liberty and they their lives Long after this when Henry the Fifth Succeeding his father Bolingbroke did reign Thy father Earl of Cambridge then deriv'd From famous Edmund Langley Duke of York Marrying my sister that thy mother was Again in pity of my hard distress Levied an army weening to redeem And have install'd me in the diadem But as the rest so fell that noble earl And was beheaded Thus the Mortimers In whom the title rested were suppress'd Of Which my lord your honour is the last True and thou seest that I no issue have And that my fainting words do warrant death Thou art my heir the rest I wish thee gather But yet be wary in thy studious care Thy grave admonishments prevail with me But yet methinks my father 's execution Was nothing less than bloody tyranny With silence nephew be thou politic Strong fixed is the house of Lancaster And like a mountain not to be remov'd But now thy uncle is removing hence As princes do their courts when they are cloy'd With long continuance in a settled place O uncle would some part of my young years Might but redeem the passage of your age Thou dost then wrong me as that slaughterer doth Which giveth many wounds when one will kill Mourn not except thou sorrow for my good Only give order for my funeral And so farewell and fair be all thy hopes And prosperous be thy life in peace and war Dies And peace no war befall thy parting soul In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage And like a hermit overpass'd thy days Well I will lock his counsel in my breast And what I do imagine let that rest Keepers convey him hence and I myself Will see his burial better than his life Com'st thou with deep premeditated lines With written pamphlets studiously devis'd Humphrey of Gloucester if thou canst accuse Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge Do it without invention suddenly I with sudden and extemporal speech Purpose to answer what thou canst object Presumptuous priest this place commands my patience Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me Think not although in writing I preferr'd The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes That therefore I have forg'd or am not able Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen No prelate such is thy audacious wickedness Thy lewd pestiferous and dissentious pranks As very infants prattle of thy pride Thou art a most pernicious usurer Froward by nature enemy to peace Lascivious wanton more than well beseems A man of thy profession and degree And for thy treachery what 's more manifest In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life As well at London Bridge as at the Tower Beside I fear me if thy thoughts were sifted The King thy sovereign is not quite exempt From envious malice of thy swelling heart Gloucester I do defy thee Lords vouchsafe To give me hearing what I shall reply If I were covetous ambitious or perverse As he will have me how am I so poor Or how haps it I seek not to advance Or raise myself but keep my wonted calling And for dissension who preferreth peace More than I do except I be provok'd No my good lords it is not that offends It is not that that incens'd hath incens'd the Duke It is because no one should sway but he No one but he should be about the King And that engenders thunder in his breast And makes him roar these accusations forth But he shall know I am as good As good Thou bastard of my grandfather Ay lordly sir for what are you I pray But one imperious in another 's throne Am I not Protector saucy priest And am not I a prelate of the church Yes as an outlaw in a castle keeps And useth it to patronage his theft Unreverent Gloucester Thou art reverend Touching thy spiritual function not thy life Rome shall remedy this Roam thither then My lord it were your duty to forbear Ay see the bishop be not overborne Methinks my lord should be religious And know the office that belongs to such Methinks his lordship should be humbler It fitteth not a prelate so to plead Yes when his holy state is touch'd so near State holy or unhallow'd what of that Is not his Grace Protector to the King Aside Plantagenet I see must hold his tongue Lest it be said ' Speak sirrah when you should Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords ' Else would I have a fling at Winchester Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester The special watchmen of our English weal I would prevail if prayers might prevail To join your hearts in love and amity O what a scandal is it to our crown That two such noble peers as ye should jar Believe me lords my tender years can tell Civil dissension is a viperous worm That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth An uproar I dare warrant Begun through malice of the Bishop 's men O my good lords and virtuous Henry Pity the city of London pity us The Bishop and the Duke of Gloucester 's men Forbidden late to carry any weapon Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones And banding themselves in contrary parts Do pelt so fast at one another 's pate That many have their giddy brains knock'd out Our windows are broke down in every street And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops We charge you on allegiance to ourself To hold your slaught'ring hands and keep the peace Pray uncle Gloucester mitigate this strife You of my household leave this peevish broil And set this unaccustom'd fight aside Stay stay I say And if you love me as you say you do Let me persuade you to forbear awhile O how this discord doth afflict my soul Can you my Lord of Winchester behold My sighs and tears and will not once relent Who should be pitiful if you be not Or who should study to prefer a peace If holy churchmen take delight in broils Yield my Lord Protector yield Winchester Except you mean with obstinate repulse To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm You see what mischief and what murder too Hath been enacted through your enmity Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood He shall submit or I will never yield Compassion on the King commands me stoop Or I would see his heart out ere the priest Should ever get that privilege of me Behold my Lord of Winchester the Duke Hath banish'd moody discontented fury As by his smoothed brows it doth appear Why look you still so stem and tragical Here Winchester I offer thee my hand Fie uncle Beaufort I have heard you preach That malice was a great and grievous sin And will not you maintain the thing you teach But prove a chief offender in the same Sweet King The Bishop hath a kindly gird For shame my Lord of Winchester relent What shall a child instruct you what to do Well Duke of Gloucester I will yield to thee Love for thy love and hand for hand I give O loving uncle kind Duke of Gloucester How joyful am I made by this contract Away my masters trouble us no more But join in friendship as your lords have done Accept this scroll most gracious sovereign Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet We do exhibit to your Majesty Well urg'd my Lord of Warwick for sweet prince An if your Grace mark every circumstance You have great reason to do Richard right Especially for those occasions At Eltham Place I told your Majesty And those occasions uncle were of force Therefore my loving lords our pleasure is That Richard be restored to his blood Let Richard be restored to his blood So shall his father 's wrongs be recompens'd As will the rest so willeth Winchester If Richard will be true not that alone But all the whole inheritance I give That doth belong unto the house of York From whence you spring by lineal descent Thy humble servant vows obedience And humble service till the point of death Stoop then and set your knee against my foot And in reguerdon of that duty done I girt thee with the valiant sword of York Rise Richard like a true Plantagenet And rise created princely Duke of York And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall And as my duty springs so perish they That grudge one thought against your Majesty Welcome high Prince the mighty Duke of York Aside Perish base Prince ignoble Duke of York Now will it best avail your Majesty To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France The presence of a king engenders love Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends As it disanimates his enemies When Gloucester says the word King Henry goes For friendly counsel cuts off many foes Your ships already are in readiness Ay we may march in England or in France Not seeing what is likely to ensue This late dissension grown betwixt the peers Burns under feigned ashes of forg'd love And will at last break out into a flame As fest'red members rot but by degree Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away So will this base and envious discord breed And now I fear that fatal prophecy Which in the time of Henry nam'd the Fifth Was in the mouth of every sucking babe That Henry born at Monmouth should win all And Henry born at Windsor should lose all Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish His days may finish ere that hapless time Exit These are the city gates the gates of Rouen Through which our policy must make a breach Take heed be wary how you place your words Talk like the vulgar sort of market men That come to gather money for their corn If we have entrance as I hope we shall And that we find the slothful watch but weak I 'll by a sign give notice to our friends That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city And we be lords and rulers over Rouen Therefore we 'll knock Knocks Within Qui est la Paysans pauvres gens de France Poor market folks that come to sell their corn Enter go in the market bell is rung Now Rouen I 'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem And once again we 'll sleep secure in Rouen Here ent'red Pucelle and her practisants Now she is there how will she specify Here is the best and safest passage in By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower Which once discern'd shows that her meaning is No way to that for weakness which she ent'red Behold this is the happy wedding torch That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen But burning fatal to the Talbotites Exit See noble Charles the beacon of our friend The burning torch in yonder turret stands Now shine it like a comet of revenge A prophet to the fall of all our foes Defer no time delays have dangerous ends Enter and cry ' The Dauphin ' presently And then do execution on the watch Alarum Exeunt France thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears If Talbot but survive thy treachery Good morrow gallants Want ye corn for bread I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast Before he 'll buy again at such a rate ' Twas full of darnel do you like the taste Scoff on vile fiend and shameless courtezan I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own And make thee curse the harvest of that corn Your Grace may starve perhaps before that time O let no words but deeds revenge this treason What you do good grey beard Break a lance And run a tilt at death within a chair Foul fiend of France and hag of all despite Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age And twit with cowardice a man half dead Damsel I 'll have a bout with you again Or else let Talbot perish with this shame Are ye so hot sir Yet Pucelle hold thy peace If Talbot do but thunder rain will follow Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field Belike your lordship takes us then for fools To try if that our own be ours or no I speak not to that railing Hecate But unto thee Alencon and the rest Will ye like soldiers come and fight it out Signior no Signior hang Base muleteers of France Like peasant foot boys do they keep the walls And dare not take up arms like gentlemen Away captains Let 's get us from the walls For Talbot means no goodness by his looks God b'uy my lord we came but to tell you That we are here Exeunt from the walls And there will we be too ere it be long Or else reproach be Talbot 's greatest fame Vow Burgundy by honour of thy house Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France Either to get the town again or die And I as sure as English Henry lives And as his father here was conqueror As sure as in this late betrayed town Great Coeur de lion 's heart was buried So sure I swear to get the town or die My vows are equal partners with thy vows But ere we go regard this dying prince The valiant Duke of Bedford Come my lord We will bestow you in some better place Fitter for sickness and for crazy age Lord Talbot do not so dishonour me Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen And will be partner of your weal or woe Courageous Bedford let us now persuade you Not to be gone from hence for once I read That stout Pendragon in his litter sick Came to the field and vanquished his foes Methinks I should revive the soldiers ' hearts Because I ever found them as myself Undaunted spirit in a dying breast Then be it so Heavens keep old Bedford safe And now no more ado brave Burgundy But gather we our forces out of hand And set upon our boasting enemy Whither away Sir John Fastolfe in such haste Whither away To save myself by flight We are like to have the overthrow again What Will you and leave Lord Talbot Ay All the Talbots in the world to save my life Exit Cowardly knight ill fortune follow thee Now quiet soul depart when heaven please For I have seen our enemies ' overthrow What is the trust or strength of foolish man They that of late were daring with their scoffs Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves Lost and recovered in a day again This is a double honour Burgundy Yet heavens have glory for this victory Warlike and martial Talbot Burgundy Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects Thy noble deeds as valour 's monuments Thanks gentle Duke But where is Pucelle now I think her old familiar is asleep Now where 's the Bastard 's braves and Charles his gleeks What all amort Rouen hangs her head for grief That such a valiant company are fled Now will we take some order in the town Placing therein some expert officers And then depart to Paris to the King For there young Henry with his nobles lie What Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy But yet before we go let 's not forget The noble Duke of Bedford late deceas'd But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen A braver soldier never couched lance A gentler heart did never sway in court But kings and mightiest potentates must die For that 's the end of human misery Exeunt Dismay not Princes at this accident Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered Care is no cure but rather corrosive For things that are not to be remedied Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while And like a peacock sweep along his tail We 'll pull his plumes and take away his train If Dauphin and the rest will be but rul'd We have guided by thee hitherto And of thy cunning had no diffidence One sudden foil shall never breed distrust Search out thy wit for secret policies And we will make thee famous through the world ALENCON We 'll set thy statue in some holy place And have thee reverenc'd like a blessed saint Employ thee then sweet virgin for our good Then thus it must be this doth Joan devise By fair persuasions mix'd with sug'red words We will entice the Duke of Burgundy To leave the Talbot and to follow us Ay marry sweeting if we could do that France were no place for Henry 's warriors Nor should that nation boast it so with us But be extirped from our provinces For ever should they be expuls'd from France And not have tide of an earldom here Your honours shall perceive how I will work To bring this matter to the wished end A parley with the Duke of Burgundy Who craves a parley with the Burgundy The princely Charles of France thy countryman What say'st thou Charles for I am marching hence Speak Pucelle and enchant him with thy words Brave Burgundy undoubted hope of France Stay let thy humble handmaid speak to thee Speak on but be not over tedious Look on thy country look on fertile France And see the cities and the towns defac'd By wasting ruin of the cruel foe As looks the mother on her lowly babe When death doth close his tender dying eyes See see the pining malady of France Behold the wounds the most unnatural wounds Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast O turn thy edged sword another way Strike those that hurt and hurt not those that help One drop of blood drawn from thy country 's bosom Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore Return thee therefore with a flood of tears And wash away thy country 's stained spots Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words Or nature makes me suddenly relent Besides all French and France exclaims on thee Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny Who join'st thou with but with a lordly nation That will not trust thee but for profit 's sake When Talbot hath set footing once in France And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill Who then but English Henry will be lord And thou be thrust out like a fugitive Call we to mind and mark but this for proof Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe And was he not in England prisoner But when they heard he was thine enemy They set him free without his ransom paid In spite of Burgundy and all his friends See then thou fight'st against thy countrymen And join'st with them will be thy slaughtermen Come come return return thou wandering lord Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms I am vanquished these haughty words of hers Have batt'red me like roaring cannon shot And made me almost yield upon my knees Forgive me country and sweet countrymen And lords accept this hearty kind embrace My forces and my power of men are yours So farewell Talbot I 'll no longer trust thee Done like a Frenchman- Aside turn and turn again Welcome brave Duke Thy friendship makes us fresh And doth beget new courage in our breasts Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this And doth deserve a coronet of gold Now let us on my lords and join our powers And seek how we may prejudice the foe Exeunt My gracious Prince and honourable peers Hearing of your arrival in this realm I have awhile given truce unto my wars To do my duty to my sovereign In sign whereof this arm that hath reclaim'd To your obedience fifty fortresses Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem Lets fall his sword before your Highness ' feet And with submissive loyalty of heart Ascribes the glory of his conquest got First to my God and next unto your Grace Kneels Is this the Lord Talbot uncle Gloucester That hath so long been resident in France Yes if it please your Majesty my liege Welcome brave captain and victorious lord When I was young as yet I am not old I do remember how my father said A stouter champion never handled sword Long since we were resolved of your truth Your faithful service and your toil in war Yet never have you tasted our reward Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks Because till now we never saw your face Therefore stand up and for these good deserts We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury And in our coronation take your place Now sir to you that were so hot at sea Disgracing of these colours that I wear In honour of my noble Lord of York Dar'st thou maintain the former words thou spak'st Yes sir as well as you dare patronage The envious barking of your saucy tongue Against my lord the Duke of Somerset Sirrah thy lord I honour as he is Why what is he As good a man as York Hark ye not so In witness take ye that Villain thou knowest the law of arms is such That whoso draws a sword ' tis present death Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood But I 'll unto his Majesty and crave I may have liberty to venge this wrong When thou shalt see I 'll meet thee to thy cost Well miscreant I 'll be there as soon as you And after meet you sooner than you would Exeunt Lord Bishop set the crown upon his head God save King Henry of that name the Sixth Now Governor of Paris take your oath My gracious sovereign as I rode from Calais To haste unto your coronation A letter was deliver'd to my hands Writ to your Grace from th ' Duke of Burgundy Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee I vow'd base knight when I did meet thee next To tear the Garter from thy craven 's leg Plucking it off Which I have done because unworthily Thou wast installed in that high degree Pardon me princely Henry and the rest This dastard at the battle of Patay When but in all I was six thousand strong And that the French were almost ten to one Before we met or that a stroke was given Like to a trusty squire did run away In which assault we lost twelve hundred men Myself and divers gentlemen beside Were there surpris'd and taken prisoners Then judge great lords if I have done amiss Or whether that such cowards ought to wear This ornament of knighthood yea or no To say the truth this fact was infamous And ill beseeming any common man Much more a knight a captain and a leader When first this order was ordain'd my lords Knights of the Garter were of noble birth Valiant and virtuous full of haughty courage Such as were grown to credit by the wars Not fearing death nor shrinking for distress But always resolute in most extremes He then that is not furnish'd in this sort Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight Profaning this most honourable order And should if I were worthy to be judge Be quite degraded like a hedge born swain That doth presume to boast of gentle blood Stain to thy countrymen thou hear'st thy doom Be packing therefore thou that wast a knight Henceforth we banish thee on pain of death Viewing the superscription What means his Grace that he hath chang'd his style No more but plain and bluntly ' To the King ' Hath he forgot he is his sovereign Or doth this churlish superscription Pretend some alteration in good will What 's here Reads ' I have upon especial cause Mov'd with compassion of my country 's wreck Together with the pitiful complaints Of such as your oppression feeds upon Forsaken your pernicious faction And join'd with Charles the rightful King of France ' O monstrous treachery Can this be so That in alliance amity and oaths There should be found such false dissembling guile What Doth my uncle Burgundy revolt He doth my lord and is become your foe Is that the worst this letter doth contain It is the worst and all my lord he writes Why then Lord Talbot there shall talk with him And give him chastisement for this abuse How say you my lord are you not content Content my liege Yes but that I am prevented I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd Then gather strength and march unto him straight Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason And what offence it is to flout his friends I go my lord in heart desiring still You may behold confusion of your foes Exit Grant me the combat gracious sovereign And me my lord grant me the combat too This is my servant hear him noble Prince And this is mine sweet Henry favour him Be patient lords and give them leave to speak Say gentlemen what makes you thus exclaim And wherefore crave you combat or with whom With him my lord for he hath done me wrong And I with him for he hath done me wrong What is that wrong whereof you both complain First let me know and then I 'll answer you Crossing the sea from England into France This fellow here with envious carping tongue Upbraided me about the rose I wear Saying the sanguine colour of the leaves Did represent my master 's blushing cheeks When stubbornly he did repugn the truth About a certain question in the law Argu'd betwixt the Duke of York and him With other vile and ignominious terms In confutation of which rude reproach And in defence of my lord 's worthiness I crave the benefit of law of arms And that is my petition noble lord For though he seem with forged quaint conceit To set a gloss upon his bold intent Yet know my lord I was provok'd by him And he first took exceptions at this badge Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower Bewray'd the faintness of my master 's heart Will not this malice Somerset be left Your private grudge my Lord of York will out Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it Good Lord what madness rules in brainsick men When for so slight and frivolous a cause Such factious emulations shall arise Good cousins both of York and Somerset Quiet yourselves I pray and be at peace Let this dissension first be tried by fight And then your Highness shall command a peace The quarrel toucheth none but us alone Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then There is my pledge accept it Somerset Nay let it rest where it began at first Confirm it so mine honourable lord Confirm it so Confounded be your strife And perish ye with your audacious prate Presumptuous vassals are you not asham'd With this immodest clamorous outrage To trouble and disturb the King and us And you my lords- methinks you do not well To bear with their perverse objections Much less to take occasion from their mouths To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves Let me persuade you take a better course It grieves his Highness Good my lords be friends Come hither you that would be combatants Henceforth I charge you as you love our favour Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause And you my lords remember where we are In France amongst a fickle wavering nation If they perceive dissension in our looks And that within ourselves we disagree How will their grudging stomachs be provok'd To wilful disobedience and rebel Beside what infamy will there arise When foreign princes shall be certified That for a toy a thing of no regard King Henry 's peers and chief nobility Destroy'd themselves and lost the realm of France O think upon the conquest of my father My tender years and let us not forgo That for a trifle that was bought with blood Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife I see no reason if I wear this rose My Lord of York I promise you the King Prettily methought did play the orator And so he did but yet I like it not In that he wears the badge of Somerset Tush that was but his fancy blame him not I dare presume sweet prince he thought no harm An if I wist he did but let it rest Other affairs must now be managed Well didst thou Richard to suppress thy voice For had the passions of thy heart burst out I fear we should have seen decipher'd there More rancorous spite more furious raging broils Than yet can be imagin'd or suppos'd But howsoe'er no simple man that sees This jarring discord of nobility This shouldering of each other in the court This factious bandying of their favourites But that it doth presage some ill event ' Tis much when sceptres are in children 's hands But more when envy breeds unkind division There comes the ruin there begins confusion Exit Go to the gates of Bordeaux trumpeter Summon their general unto the wall Thou ominous and fearful owl of death Our nation 's terror and their bloody scourge The period of thy tyranny approacheth On us thou canst not enter but by death For I protest we are well fortified And strong enough to issue out and fight If thou retire the Dauphin well appointed Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd To wall thee from the liberty of flight And no way canst thou turn thee for redress But death doth front thee with apparent spoil And pale destruction meets thee in the face Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament To rive their dangerous artillery Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot Lo there thou stand'st a breathing valiant man Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit This is the latest glory of thy praise That I thy enemy due thee withal For ere the glass that now begins to run Finish the process of his sandy hour These eyes that see thee now well coloured Shall see thee withered bloody pale and dead He fables not I hear the enemy Out some light horsemen and peruse their wings O negligent and heedless discipline How are we park'd and bounded in a pale A little herd of England 's timorous deer Maz'd with a yelping kennel of French curs If we be English deer be then in blood Not rascal like to fall down with a pinch But rather moody mad and desperate stags Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel And make the cowards stand aloof at bay Sell every man his life as dear as mine And they shall find dear deer of us my friends God and Saint George Talbot and England 's right Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight Exeunt Are not the speedy scouts return'd again That dogg'd the mighty army of the Dauphin They are return'd my lord and give it out That he is march'd to Bordeaux with his power To fight with Talbot as he march'd along By your espials were discovered Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led Which join'd with him and made their march for Bordeaux A plague upon that villain Somerset That thus delays my promised supply Of horsemen that were levied for this siege Renowned Talbot doth expect my aid And I am louted by a traitor villain And can not help the noble chevalier God comfort him in this necessity If he miscarry farewell wars in France Thou princely leader of our English strength Never so needful on the earth of France Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot Who now is girdled with a waist of iron And hemm'd about with grim destruction To Bordeaux warlike Duke to Bordeaux York Else farewell Talbot France and England 's honour O God that Somerset who in proud heart Doth stop my cornets were in Talbot 's place So should we save a valiant gentleman By forfeiting a traitor and a coward Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep That thus we die while remiss traitors sleep O send some succour to the distress'd lord He dies we lose I break my warlike word We mourn France smiles We lose they daily get- All long of this vile traitor Somerset Then God take mercy on brave Talbot 's soul And on his son young John who two hours since I met in travel toward his warlike father This seven years did not Talbot see his son And now they meet where both their lives are done Alas what joy shall noble Talbot have To bid his young son welcome to his grave Away vexation almost stops my breath That sund'red friends greet in the hour of death Lucy farewell no more my fortune can But curse the cause I can not aid the man Maine Blois Poictiers and Tours are won away Long all of Somerset and his delay Exit with forces Thus while the vulture of sedition Feeds in the bosom of such great commanders Sleeping neglection doth betray to loss The conquest of our scarce cold conqueror That ever living man of memory Henry the Fifth Whiles they each other cross Lives honours lands and all hurry to loss Exit It is too late I can not send them now This expedition was by York and Talbot Too rashly plotted all our general force Might with a sally of the very town Be buckled with The over daring Talbot Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour By this unheedful desperate wild adventure York set him on to fight and die in shame That Talbot dead great York might bear the name Here is Sir William Lucy who with me Set from our o'er match'd forces forth for aid How now Sir William Whither were you sent Whither my lord From bought and sold Lord Talbot Who ring'd about with bold adversity Cries out for noble York and Somerset To beat assailing death from his weak legions And whiles the honourable captain there Drops bloody sweat from his war wearied limbs And in advantage ling'ring looks for rescue You his false hopes the trust of England 's honour Keep off aloof with worthless emulation Let not your private discord keep away The levied succours that should lend him aid While he renowned noble gentleman Yield up his life unto a world of odds Orleans the Bastard Charles Burgundy Alencon Reignier compass him about And Talbot perisheth by your default York set him on York should have sent him aid And York as fast upon your Grace exclaims Swearing that you withhold his levied host Collected for this expedition York lies he might have sent and had the horse I owe him little duty and less love And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending The fraud of England not the force of France Hath now entrapp'd the noble minded Talbot Never to England shall he bear his life But dies betray'd to fortune by your strife Come go I will dispatch the horsemen straight Within six hours they will be at his aid Too late comes rescue he is ta'en or slain For fly he could not if he would have fled And fly would Talbot never though he might If he be dead brave Talbot then adieu His fame lives in the world his shame in you Exeunt O young John Talbot I did send for thee To tutor thee in stratagems of war That Talbot 's name might be in thee reviv'd When sapless age and weak unable limbs Should bring thy father to his drooping chair But O malignant and ill boding stars Now thou art come unto a feast of death A terrible and unavoided danger Therefore dear boy mount on my swiftest horse And I 'll direct thee how thou shalt escape By sudden flight Come dally not be gone Is my name Talbot and am I your son And shall I fly O if you love my mother Dishonour not her honourable name To make a bastard and a slave of me The world will say he is not Talbot 's blood That basely fled when noble Talbot stood Fly to revenge my death if I be slain He that flies so will ne'er return again If we both stay we both are sure to die Then let me stay and father do you fly Your loss is great so your regard should be My worth unknown no loss is known in me Upon my death the French can little boast In yours they will in you all hopes are lost Flight can not stain the honour you have won But mine it will that no exploit have done You fled for vantage every one will swear But if I bow they 'll say it was for fear There is no hope that ever I will stay If the first hour I shrink and run away Here on my knee I beg mortality Rather than life preserv'd with infamy Shall all thy mother 's hopes lie in one tomb Ay rather than I 'll shame my mother 's womb Upon my blessing I command thee go To fight I will but not to fly the foe Part of thy father may be sav'd in thee No part of him but will be shame in me Thou never hadst renown nor canst not lose it Yes your renowned name shall flight abuse it Thy father 's charge shall clear thee from that stain You can not witness for me being slain If death be so apparent then both fly And leave my followers here to fight and die My age was never tainted with such shame And shall my youth be guilty of such blame No more can I be severed from your side Than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide Stay go do what you will the like do I For live I will not if my father die Then here I take my leave of thee fair son Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon Come side by side together live and die And soul with soul from France to heaven fly Exeunt Saint George and victory Fight soldiers fight The Regent hath with Talbot broke his word And left us to the rage of France his sword Where is John Talbot Pause and take thy breath I gave thee life and rescu'd thee from death O twice my father twice am I thy son The life thou gav'st me first was lost and done Till with thy warlike sword despite of fate To my determin'd time thou gav'st new date When from the Dauphin 's crest thy sword struck fire It warm'd thy father 's heart with proud desire Of bold fac'd victory Then leaden age Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage Beat down Alencon Orleans Burgundy And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee The ireful bastard Orleans that drew blood From thee my boy and had the maidenhood Of thy first fight I soon encountered And interchanging blows I quickly shed Some of his bastard blood and in disgrace Bespoke him thus ' Contaminated base And misbegotten blood I spill of thine Mean and right poor for that pure blood of mine Which thou didst force from Talbot my brave boy ' Here purposing the Bastard to destroy Came in strong rescue Speak thy father 's care Art thou not weary John How dost thou fare Wilt thou yet leave the battle boy and fly Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry Fly to revenge my death when I am dead The help of one stands me in little stead O too much folly is it well I wot To hazard all our lives in one small boat If I to day die not with Frenchmen 's rage To morrow I shall die with mickle age By me they nothing gain an if I stay ' Tis but the short'ning of my life one day In thee thy mother dies our household 's name My death 's revenge thy youth and England 's fame All these and more we hazard by thy stay All these are sav'd if thou wilt fly away The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart These words of yours draw life blood from my heart On that advantage bought with such a shame To save a paltry life and slay bright fame Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly The coward horse that bears me fall and die And like me to the peasant boys of France To be shame 's scorn and subject of mischance Surely by all the glory you have won An if I fly I am not Talbot 's son Then talk no more of flight it is no boot If son to Talbot die at Talbot 's foot Then follow thou thy desp'rate sire of Crete Thou Icarus thy life to me is sweet If thou wilt fight fight by thy father 's side And commendable prov'd let 's die in pride Exeunt Where is my other life Mine own is gone O where 's young Talbot Where is valiant John Triumphant death smear'd with captivity Young Talbot 's valour makes me smile at thee When he perceiv'd me shrink and on my knee His bloody sword he brandish'd over me And like a hungry lion did commence Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience But when my angry guardant stood alone Tend'ring my ruin and assail'd of none Dizzy ey'd fury and great rage of heart Suddenly made him from my side to start Into the clust'ring battle of the French And in that sea of blood my boy did drench His overmounting spirit and there died My Icarus my blossom in his pride O my dear lord lo where your son is borne Thou antic Death which laugh'st us here to scorn Anon from thy insulting tyranny Coupled in bonds of perpetuity Two Talbots winged through the lither sky In thy despite shall scape mortality O thou whose wounds become hard favoured Death Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath Brave Death by speaking whether he will or no Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe Poor boy he smiles methinks as who should say Had Death been French then Death had died to day Come come and lay him in his father 's arms My spirit can no longer bear these harms Soldiers adieu I have what I would have Now my old arms are young John Talbot 's grave Dies Had York and Somerset brought rescue in We should have found a bloody day of this How the young whelp of Talbot 's raging wood Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen 's blood Once I encount'red him and thus I said ' Thou maiden youth be vanquish'd by a maid ' But with a proud majestical high scorn He answer'd thus ' Young Talbot was not born To be the pillage of a giglot wench ' So rushing in the bowels of the French He left me proudly as unworthy fight Doubtless he would have made a noble knight See where he lies inhearsed in the arms Of the most bloody nurser of his harms Hew them to pieces hack their bones asunder Whose life was England 's glory Gallia 's wonder O no forbear For that which we have fled During the life let us not wrong it dead Herald conduct me to the Dauphin 's tent To know who hath obtain'd the glory of the day On what submissive message art thou sent Submission Dauphin ' Tis a mere French word We English warriors wot not what it means I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta'en And to survey the bodies of the dead For prisoners ask'st thou Hell our prison is But tell me whom thou seek'st But where 's the great Alcides of the field Valiant Lord Talbot Earl of Shrewsbury Created for his rare success in arms Great Earl of Washford Waterford and Valence Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield Lord Strange of Blackmere Lord Verdun of Alton Lord Cromwell of Wingfield Lord Furnival of Sheffield The thrice victorious Lord of Falconbridge Knight of the noble order of Saint George Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece Great Marshal to Henry the Sixth Of all his wars within the realm of France Here 's a silly stately style indeed The Turk that two and fifty kingdoms hath Writes not so tedious a style as this Him that thou magnifi'st with all these tides Stinking and fly blown lies here at our feet Is Talbot slain the Frenchmen 's only scourge Your kingdom 's terror and black Nemesis O were mine eye bans into bullets turn'd That I in rage might shoot them at your faces O that I could but can these dead to life It were enough to fright the realm of France Were but his picture left amongst you here It would amaze the proudest of you all Give me their bodies that I may bear them hence And give them burial as beseems their worth I think this upstart is old Talbot 's ghost He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit For God 's sake let him have them to keep them here They would but stink and putrefy the air Go take their bodies hence I 'll bear them hence but from their ashes shall be rear'd A phoenix that shall make all France afeard So we be rid of them do with them what thou wilt And now to Paris in this conquering vein All will be ours now bloody Talbot 's slain Exeunt Have you perus'd the letters from the Pope The Emperor and the Earl of Armagnac I have my lord and their intent is this They humbly sue unto your Excellence To have a godly peace concluded of Between the realms of England and of France How doth your Grace affect their motion Well my good lord and as the only means To stop effusion of our Christian blood And stablish quietness on every side Ay marry uncle for I always thought It was both impious and unnatural That such immanity and bloody strife Should reign among professors of one faith Beside my lord the sooner to effect And surer bind this knot of amity The Earl of Armagnac near knit to Charles A man of great authority in France Proffers his only daughter to your Grace In marriage with a large and sumptuous dowry Marriage uncle Alas my years are young And fitter is my study and my books Than wanton dalliance with a paramour Yet call th ' ambassadors and as you please So let them have their answers every one I shall be well content with any choice Tends to God 's glory and my country 's weal What Is my Lord of Winchester install'd And call'd unto a cardinal 's degree Then I perceive that will be verified Henry the Fifth did sometime prophesy ' If once he come to be a cardinal He 'll make his cap co equal with the crown ' My Lords Ambassadors your several suits Have been consider'd and debated on Your purpose is both good and reasonable And therefore are we certainly resolv'd To draw conditions of a friendly peace Which by my Lord of Winchester we mean Shall be transported presently to France And for the proffer of my lord your master I have inform'd his Highness so at large As liking of the lady 's virtuous gifts Her beauty and the value of her dower He doth intend she shall be England 's Queen To AMBASSADOR In argument and proof of which contract Bear her this jewel pledge of my affection And so my Lord Protector see them guarded And safely brought to Dover where inshipp'd Commit them to the fortune of the sea Stay my Lord Legate you shall first receive The sum of money which I promised Should be delivered to his Holiness For clothing me in these grave ornaments I will attend upon your lordship 's leisure Aside Now Winchester will not submit I trow Or be inferior to the proudest peer Humphrey of Gloucester thou shalt well perceive That neither in birth or for authority The Bishop will be overborne by thee I 'll either make thee stoop and bend thy knee Or sack this country with a mutiny Exeunt These news my lords may cheer our drooping spirits ' Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt And turn again unto the warlike French Then march to Paris royal Charles of France And keep not back your powers in dalliance Peace be amongst them if they turn to us Else ruin combat with their palaces Success unto our valiant general And happiness to his accomplices What tidings send our scouts I prithee speak The English army that divided was Into two parties is now conjoin'd in one And means to give you battle presently Somewhat too sudden sirs the warning is But we will presently provide for them I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there Now he is gone my lord you need not fear Of all base passions fear is most accurs'd Command the conquest Charles it shall be thine Let Henry fret and all the world repine Then on my lords and France be fortunate The Regent conquers and the Frenchmen fly Now help ye charming spells and periapts And ye choice spirits that admonish me And give me signs of future accidents Thunder You speedy helpers that are substitutes Under the lordly monarch of the north Appear and aid me in this enterprise Damsel of France I think I have you fast Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms And try if they can gain your liberty A goodly prize fit for the devil 's grace See how the ugly witch doth bend her brows As if with Circe she would change my shape Chang'd to a worser shape thou canst not be O Charles the Dauphin is a proper man No shape but his can please your dainty eye A plaguing mischief fight on Charles and thee And may ye both be suddenly surpris'd By bloody hands in sleeping on your beds Fell banning hag enchantress hold thy tongue I prithee give me leave to curse awhile Curse miscreant when thou comest to the stake Be what thou wilt thou art my prisoner Margaret my name and daughter to a king The King of Naples whosoe'er thou art An earl I am and Suffolk am I call'd Be not offended nature 's miracle Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me So doth the swan her downy cygnets save Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings Yet if this servile usage once offend Go and be free again as Suffolk 's friend She is going O stay Aside I have no power to let her pass My hand would free her but my heart says no As plays the sun upon the glassy streams Twinkling another counterfeited beam So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes Fain would I woo her yet I dare not speak I 'll call for pen and ink and write my mind Fie de la Pole disable not thyself Hast not a tongue Is she not here thy prisoner Wilt thou be daunted at a woman 's sight Ay beauty 's princely majesty is such Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough Say Earl of Suffolk if thy name be so What ransom must I pay before I pass For I perceive I am thy prisoner Aside How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit Before thou make a trial of her love Why speak'st thou not What ransom must I pay Aside She 's beautiful and therefore to be woo'd She is a woman therefore to be won Wilt thou accept of ransom yea or no Aside Fond man remember that thou hast a wife Then how can Margaret be thy paramour I were best leave him for he will not hear Aside There all is marr'd there lies a cooling card He talks at random sure the man is mad Aside And yet a dispensation may be had And yet I would that you would answer me Aside I 'll win this Lady Margaret For whom Why for my King Tush that 's a wooden thing He talks of wood It is some carpenter Aside Yet so my fancy may be satisfied And peace established between these realms But there remains a scruple in that too For though her father be the King of Naples Duke of Anjou and Maine yet is he poor And our nobility will scorn the match Hear ye Captain are you not at leisure Aside It shall be so disdain they ne'er so much Henry is youthful and will quickly yield Madam I have a secret to reveal Aside What though I be enthrall'd He seems a knight And will not any way dishonour me Lady vouchsafe to listen what I say Aside Perhaps I shall be rescu'd by the French And then I need not crave his courtesy Sweet madam give me hearing in a cause Aside Tush women have been captivate ere now Lady wherefore talk you so I cry you mercy ' tis but quid for quo Say gentle Princess would you not suppose Your bondage happy to be made a queen To be a queen in bondage is more vile Than is a slave in base servility For princes should be free And so shall you If happy England 's royal king be free Why what concerns his freedom unto me I 'll undertake to make thee Henry 's queen To put a golden sceptre in thy hand And set a precious crown upon thy head If thou wilt condescend to be my- What His love I am unworthy to be Henry 's wife No gentle madam I unworthy am To woo so fair a dame to be his wife And have no portion in the choice myself How say you madam Are ye so content An if my father please I am content Then call our captains and our colours forth And madam at your father 's castle walls We 'll crave a parley to confer with him To whom To me Suffolk what remedy I am a soldier and unapt to weep Or to exclaim on fortune 's fickleness Yes there is remedy enough my lord Consent and for thy honour give consent Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto And this her easy held imprisonment Hath gain'd thy daughter princely liberty Speaks Suffolk as he thinks Fair Margaret knows That Suffolk doth not flatter face or feign Upon thy princely warrant I descend To give thee answer of thy just demand And here I will expect thy coming Welcome brave Earl into our territories Command in Anjou what your Honour pleases Thanks Reignier happy for so sweet a child Fit to be made companion with a king What answer makes your Grace unto my suit Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth To be the princely bride of such a lord Upon condition I may quietly Enjoy mine own the country Maine and Anjou Free from oppression or the stroke of war My daughter shall be Henry 's if he please That is her ransom I deliver her And those two counties I will undertake Your Grace shall well and quietly enjoy And I again in Henry 's royal name As deputy unto that gracious king Give thee her hand for sign of plighted faith Reignier of France I give thee kingly thanks Because this is in traffic of a king Aside And yet methinks I could be well content To be mine own attorney in this case I 'll over then to England with this news And make this marriage to be solemniz'd So farewell Reignier Set this diamond safe In golden palaces as it becomes I do embrace thee as I would embrace The Christian prince King Henry were he here Farewell my lord Good wishes praise and prayers Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret She is going Farewell sweet madam But hark you Margaret No princely commendations to my king Such commendations as becomes a maid A virgin and his servant say to him Words sweetly plac'd and modestly directed But madam I must trouble you again No loving token to his Majesty Yes my good lord a pure unspotted heart Never yet taint with love I send the King And this withal Kisses her That for thyself I will not so presume To send such peevish tokens to a king O wert thou for myself But Suffolk stay Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount And natural graces that extinguish art Repeat their semblance often on the seas That when thou com'st to kneel at Henry 's feet Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder Exit Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn Ah Joan this kills thy father 's heart outright Have I sought every country far and near And now it is my chance to find thee out Must I behold thy timeless cruel death Ah Joan sweet daughter Joan I 'll die with thee Decrepit miser base ignoble wretch I am descended of a gentler blood Thou art no father nor no friend of mine Out out My lords an please you ' tis not so I did beget her all the parish knows Her mother liveth yet can testify She was the first fruit of my bach'lorship Graceless wilt thou deny thy parentage This argues what her kind of life hath been- Wicked and vile and so her death concludes Fie Joan that thou wilt be so obstacle God knows thou art a collop of my flesh And for thy sake have I shed many a tear Deny me not I prithee gentle Joan Peasant avaunt You have suborn'd this man Of purpose to obscure my noble birth ' Tis true I gave a noble to the priest The morn that I was wedded to her mother Kneel down and take my blessing good my girl Wilt thou not stoop Now cursed be the time Of thy nativity I would the milk Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake Or else when thou didst keep my lambs afield I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee Dost thou deny thy father cursed drab O burn her burn her Hanging is too good Exit Take her away for she hath liv'd too long To fill the world with vicious qualities First let me tell you whom you have condemn'd Not me begotten of a shepherd swain But issued from the progeny of kings Virtuous and holy chosen from above By inspiration of celestial grace To work exceeding miracles on earth I never had to do with wicked spirits But you that are polluted with your lusts Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices Because you want the grace that others have You judge it straight a thing impossible To compass wonders but by help of devils No misconceived Joan of Arc hath been A virgin from her tender infancy Chaste and immaculate in very thought Whose maiden blood thus rigorously effus'd Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven Ay ay Away with her to execution And hark ye sirs because she is a maid Spare for no fagots let there be enow Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake That so her torture may be shortened Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts Then Joan discover thine infirmity That warranteth by law to be thy privilege I am with child ye bloody homicides Murder not then the fruit within my womb Although ye hale me to a violent death Now heaven forfend The holy maid with child The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought Is all your strict preciseness come to this She and the Dauphin have been juggling I did imagine what would be her refuge Well go to we 'll have no bastards live Especially since Charles must father it You are deceiv'd my child is none of his It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love Alencon that notorious Machiavel It dies an if it had a thousand lives O give me leave I have deluded you ' Twas neither Charles nor yet the Duke I nam'd But Reignier King of Naples that prevail'd A married man That 's most intolerable Why here 's a girl I think she knows not well There were so many whom she may accuse It 's sign she hath been liberal and free And yet forsooth she is a virgin pure Strumpet thy words condemn thy brat and thee Use no entreaty for it is in vain Then lead me hence with whom I leave my curse May never glorious sun reflex his beams Upon the country where you make abode But darkness and the gloomy shade of death Environ you till mischief and despair Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes Thou foul accursed minister of hell Lord Regent I do greet your Excellence With letters of commission from the King For know my lords the states of Christendom Mov'd with remorse of these outrageous broils Have earnestly implor'd a general peace Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French And here at hand the Dauphin and his train Approacheth to confer about some matter Is all our travail turn'd to this effect After the slaughter of so many peers So many captains gentlemen and soldiers That in this quarrel have been overthrown And sold their bodies for their country 's benefit Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace Have we not lost most part of all the towns By treason falsehood and by treachery Our great progenitors had conquered O Warwick Warwick I foresee with grief The utter loss of all the realm of France Be patient York If we conclude a peace It shall be with such strict and severe covenants As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby Since lords of England it is thus agreed That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France We come to be informed by yourselves What the conditions of that league must be Speak Winchester for boiling choler chokes The hollow passage of my poison'd voice By sight of these our baleful enemies Charles and the rest it is enacted thus That in regard King Henry gives consent Of mere compassion and of lenity To ease your country of distressful war An suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace You shall become true liegemen to his crown And Charles upon condition thou wilt swear To pay him tribute and submit thyself Thou shalt be plac'd as viceroy under him And still enjoy thy regal dignity Must he be then as shadow of himself Adorn his temples with a coronet And yet in substance and authority Retain but privilege of a private man This proffer is absurd and reasonless ' Tis known already that I am possess'd With more than half the Gallian territories And therein reverenc'd for their lawful king Shall I for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd Detract so much from that prerogative As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole No Lord Ambassador I 'll rather keep That which I have than coveting for more Be cast from possibility of all Insulting Charles Hast thou by secret means Us'd intercession to obtain a league And now the matter grows to compromise Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison Either accept the title thou usurp'st Of benefit proceeding from our king And not of any challenge of desert Or we will plague thee with incessant wars To CHARLES My lord you do not well in obstinacy To cavil in the course of this contract If once it be neglected ten to one We shall not find like opportunity To CHARLES To say the truth it is your policy To save your subjects from such massacre And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen By our proceeding in hostility And therefore take this compact of a truce Although you break it when your pleasure serves How say'st thou Charles Shall our condition stand It shall Only reserv'd you claim no interest In any of our towns of garrison Then swear allegiance to his Majesty As thou art knight never to disobey Nor be rebellious to the crown of England Thou nor thy nobles to the crown of England Your wondrous rare description noble Earl Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me Her virtues graced with external gifts Do breed love 's settled passions in my heart And like as rigour of tempestuous gusts Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide So am I driven by breath of her renown Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive Where I may have fruition of her love Tush my good lord This superficial tale Is but a preface of her worthy praise The chief perfections of that lovely dame Had I sufficient skill to utter them Would make a volume of enticing lines Able to ravish any dull conceit And which is more she is not so divine So full replete with choice of all delights But with as humble lowliness of mind She is content to be at your command Command I mean of virtuous intents To love and honour Henry as her lord And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume Therefore my Lord Protector give consent That Margaret may be England 's royal Queen So should I give consent to flatter sin You know my lord your Highness is betroth'd Unto another lady of esteem How shall we then dispense with that contract And not deface your honour with reproach As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths Or one that at a triumph having vow'd To try his strength forsaketh yet the lists By reason of his adversary 's odds A poor earl 's daughter is unequal odds And therefore may be broke without offence Why what I pray is Margaret more than that Her father is no better than an earl Although in glorious titles he excel Yes my lord her father is a king The King of Naples and Jerusalem And of such great authority in France As his alliance will confirm our peace And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance And so the Earl of Armagnac may do Because he is near kinsman unto Charles Beside his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower Where Reignier sooner will receive than give A dow'r my lords Disgrace not so your king That he should be so abject base and poor To choose for wealth and not for perfect love Henry is able to enrich his queen And not to seek a queen to make him rich So worthless peasants bargain for their wives As market men for oxen sheep or horse Marriage is a matter of more worth Than to be dealt in by attorneyship Not whom we will but whom his Grace affects Must be companion of his nuptial bed And therefore lords since he affects her most It most of all these reasons bindeth us In our opinions she should be preferr'd For what is wedlock forced but a hell An age of discord and continual strife Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss And is a pattern of celestial peace Whom should we match with Henry being a king But Margaret that is daughter to a king Her peerless feature joined with her birth Approves her fit for none but for a king Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit More than in women commonly is seen Will answer our hope in issue of a king For Henry son unto a conqueror Is likely to beget more conquerors If with a lady of so high resolve As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love Then yield my lords and here conclude with me That Margaret shall be Queen and none but she Whether it be through force of your report My noble Lord of Suffolk or for that My tender youth was never yet attaint With any passion of inflaming love I can not tell but this I am assur'd I feel such sharp dissension in my breast Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear As I am sick with working of my thoughts Take therefore shipping post my lord to France Agree to any covenants and procure That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come To cross the seas to England and be crown'd King Henry 's faithful and anointed queen For your expenses and sufficient charge Among the people gather up a tenth Be gone I say for till you do return I rest perplexed with a thousand cares And you good uncle banish all offence If you do censure me by what you were Not what you are I know it will excuse This sudden execution of my will And so conduct me where from company I may revolve and ruminate my grief Exit Ay grief I fear me both at first and last Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd and thus he goes As did the youthful Paris once to Greece With hope to find the like event in love But prosper better than the Troyan did Margaret shall now be Queen and rule the King But I will rule both her the King and realm Exit As by your high imperial Majesty I had in charge at my depart for France As procurator to your Excellence To marry Princess Margaret for your Grace So in the famous ancient city Tours In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil The Dukes of Orleans Calaber Bretagne and Alencon Seven earls twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops I have perform'd my task and was espous'd And humbly now upon my bended knee In sight of England and her lordly peers Deliver up my title in the Queen To your most gracious hands that are the substance Of that great shadow I did represent The happiest gift that ever marquis gave The fairest queen that ever king receiv'd Suffolk arise Welcome Queen Margaret I can express no kinder sign of love Than this kind kiss O Lord that lends me life Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness For thou hast given me in this beauteous face A world of earthly blessings to my soul If sympathy of love unite our thoughts Great King of England and my gracious lord The mutual conference that my mind hath had By day by night waking and in my dreams In courtly company or at my beads With you mine alder liefest sovereign Makes me the bolder to salute my king With ruder terms such as my wit affords And over joy of heart doth minister Her sight did ravish but her grace in speech Her words y clad with wisdom 's majesty Makes me from wond'ring fall to weeping joys Such is the fulness of my heart 's content Lords with one cheerful voice welcome my love Kneeling Long live Queen Margaret England 's happiness We thank you all Flourish My Lord Protector so it please your Grace Here are the articles of contracted peace Between our sovereign and the French King Charles For eighteen months concluded by consent Reads ' Imprimis It is agreed between the French King Charles and William de la Pole Marquess of Suffolk ambassador for Henry King of England that the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret daughter unto Reignier King of Naples Sicilia and Jerusalem and crown her Queen of England ere the thirtieth of May next ensuing Uncle how now Pardon me gracious lord Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart And dimm'd mine eyes that I can read no further Uncle of Winchester I pray read on Reads ' Item It is further agreed between them that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be released and delivered over to the King her father and she sent over of the King of England 's own proper cost and charges without having any dowry ' They please us well Lord Marquess kneel down We here create thee the first Duke of Suffolk And girt thee with the sword Cousin of York We here discharge your Grace from being Regent I ' th ' parts of France till term of eighteen months Be full expir'd Thanks uncle Winchester Gloucester York Buckingham Somerset Salisbury and Warwick We thank you all for this great favour done In entertainment to my princely queen Come let us in and with all speed provide To see her coronation be perform'd Brave peers of England pillars of the state To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief Your grief the common grief of all the land What did my brother Henry spend his youth His valour coin and people in the wars Did he so often lodge in open field In winter 's cold and summer 's parching heat To conquer France his true inheritance And did my brother Bedford toil his wits To keep by policy what Henry got Have you yourselves Somerset Buckingham Brave York Salisbury and victorious Warwick Receiv'd deep scars in France and Normandy Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself With all the learned Council of the realm Studied so long sat in the Council House Early and late debating to and fro How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe And had his Highness in his infancy Crowned in Paris in despite of foes And shall these labours and these honours die Shall Henry 's conquest Bedford 's vigilance Your deeds of war and all our counsel die O peers of England shameful is this league Fatal this marriage cancelling your fame Blotting your names from books of memory Razing the characters of your renown Defacing monuments of conquer'd France Undoing all as all had never been Nephew what means this passionate discourse This peroration with such circumstance For France ' tis ours and we will keep it still Ay uncle we will keep it if we can But now it is impossible we should Suffolk the new made duke that rules the roast Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine Unto the poor King Reignier whose large style Agrees not with the leanness of his purse Now by the death of Him that died for all These counties were the keys of Normandy But wherefore weeps Warwick my valiant son For grief that they are past recovery For were there hope to conquer them again My sword should shed hot blood mine eyes no tears Anjou and Maine myself did win them both Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer And are the cities that I got with wounds Deliver'd up again with peaceful words Mort Dieu For Suffolk 's duke may he be suffocate That dims the honour of this warlike isle France should have torn and rent my very heart Before I would have yielded to this league I never read but England 's kings have had Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives And our King Henry gives away his own To match with her that brings no vantages A proper jest and never heard before That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth For costs and charges in transporting her She should have stay'd in France and starv'd in France Before- My Lord of Gloucester now ye grow too hot It was the pleasure of my lord the King My Lord of Winchester I know your mind ' Tis not my speeches that you do mislike But ' tis my presence that doth trouble ye Rancour will out proud prelate in thy face I see thy fury if I longer stay We shall begin our ancient bickerings Lordings farewell and say when I am gone I prophesied France will be lost ere long Exit So there goes our Protector in a rage ' Tis known to you he is mine enemy Nay more an enemy unto you all And no great friend I fear me to the King Consider lords he is the next of blood And heir apparent to the English crown Had Henry got an empire by his marriage And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west There 's reason he should be displeas'd at it Look to it lords let not his smoothing words Bewitch your hearts be wise and circumspect What though the common people favour him Calling him ' Humphrey the good Duke of Gloucester ' Clapping their hands and crying with loud voice ' Jesu maintain your royal excellence ' With ' God preserve the good Duke Humphrey ' I fear me lords for all this flattering gloss He will be found a dangerous Protector Why should he then protect our sovereign He being of age to govern of himself Cousin of Somerset join you with me And all together with the Duke of Suffolk We 'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat This weighty business will not brook delay I 'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently Exit Cousin of Buckingham though Humphrey 's pride And greatness of his place be grief to us Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal His insolence is more intolerable Than all the princes in the land beside If Gloucester be displac'd he 'll be Protector Or thou or I Somerset will be Protector Despite Duke Humphrey or the Cardinal Pride went before ambition follows him While these do labour for their own preferment Behoves it us to labour for the realm I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester Did bear him like a noble gentleman Oft have I seen the haughty Cardinal- More like a soldier than a man o ' th ' church As stout and proud as he were lord of all- Swear like a ruffian and demean himself Unlike the ruler of a commonweal Warwick my son the comfort of my age Thy deeds thy plainness and thy housekeeping Hath won the greatest favour of the commons Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey And brother York thy acts in Ireland In bringing them to civil discipline Thy late exploits done in the heart of France When thou wert Regent for our sovereign Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people Join we together for the public good In what we can to bridle and suppress The pride of Suffolk and the Cardinal With Somerset 's and Buckingham 's ambition And as we may cherish Duke Humphrey 's deeds While they do tend the profit of the land So God help Warwick as he loves the land And common profit of his country And so says York- Aside for he hath greatest cause Then let 's make haste away and look unto the main Unto the main O father Maine is lost- That Maine which by main force Warwick did win And would have kept so long as breath did last Main chance father you meant but I meant Maine Which I will win from France or else be slain Anjou and Maine are given to the French Paris is lost the state of Normandy Stands on a tickle point now they are gone Suffolk concluded on the articles The peers agreed and Henry was well pleas'd To changes two dukedoms for a duke 's fair daughter I can not blame them all what is't to them ' Tis thine they give away and not their own Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage And purchase friends and give to courtezans Still revelling like lords till all be gone While as the silly owner of the goods Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof While all is shar'd and all is borne away Ready to starve and dare not touch his own So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold Methinks the realms of England France and Ireland Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood As did the fatal brand Althaea burnt Unto the prince 's heart of Calydon Anjou and Maine both given unto the French Cold news for me for I had hope of France Even as I have of fertile England 's soil A day will come when York shall claim his own And therefore I will take the Nevils ' parts And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey And when I spy advantage claim the crown For that 's the golden mark I seek to hit Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist Nor wear the diadem upon his head Whose church like humours fits not for a crown Then York be still awhile till time do serve Watch thou and wake when others be asleep To pry into the secrets of the state Till Henry surfeiting in joys of love With his new bride and England 's dear bought queen And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars Then will I raise aloft the milk white rose With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfum'd And in my standard bear the arms of York To grapple with the house of Lancaster And force perforce I 'll make him yield the crown Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down Exit Why droops my lord like over ripen'd corn Hanging the head at Ceres ' plenteous load Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows As frowning at the favours of the world Why are thine eyes fix'd to the sullen earth Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight What see'st thou there King Henry 's diadem Enchas'd with all the honours of the world If so gaze on and grovel on thy face Until thy head be circled with the same Put forth thy hand reach at the glorious gold What is't too short I 'll lengthen it with mine And having both together heav'd it up We 'll both together lift our heads to heaven And never more abase our sight so low As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground O Nell sweet Nell if thou dost love thy lord Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts And may that thought when I imagine ill Against my king and nephew virtuous Henry Be my last breathing in this mortal world My troublous dreams this night doth make me sad What dream'd my lord Tell me and I 'll requite it With sweet rehearsal of my morning 's dream Methought this staff mine office badge in court Was broke in twain by whom I have forgot But as I think it was by th ' Cardinal And on the pieces of the broken wand Were plac'd the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset And William de la Pole first Duke of Suffolk This was my dream what it doth bode God knows Tut this was nothing but an argument That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester 's grove Shall lose his head for his presumption But list to me my Humphrey my sweet Duke Methought I sat in seat of majesty In the cathedral church of Westminster And in that chair where kings and queens were crown'd Where Henry and Dame Margaret kneel'd to me And on my head did set the diadem Nay Eleanor then must I chide outright Presumptuous dame ill nurtur'd Eleanor Art thou not second woman in the realm And the Protector 's wife belov'd of him Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command Above the reach or compass of thy thought And wilt thou still be hammering treachery To tumble down thy husband and thyself From top of honour to disgrace 's feet Away from me and let me hear no more What what my lord Are you so choleric With Eleanor for telling but her dream Next time I 'll keep my dreams unto myself And not be check'd Nay be not angry I am pleas'd again My Lord Protector ' tis his Highness ' pleasure You do prepare to ride unto Saint Albans Where as the King and Queen do mean to hawk I go Come Nell thou wilt ride with us Yes my good lord I 'll follow presently Jesus preserve your royal Majesty What say'st thou Majesty I am but Grace But by the grace of God and Hume 's advice Your Grace 's title shall be multiplied What say'st thou man Hast thou as yet conferr'd With Margery Jourdain the cunning witch of Eie With Roger Bolingbroke the conjurer And will they undertake to do me good This they have promised to show your Highness A spirit rais'd from depth of underground That shall make answer to such questions As by your Grace shall be propounded him It is enough I 'll think upon the questions When from Saint Albans we do make return We 'll see these things effected to the full Here Hume take this reward make merry man With thy confederates in this weighty cause Exit Hume must make merry with the Duchess ' gold Marry and shall But how now Sir John Hume Seal up your lips and give no words but mum The business asketh silent secrecy Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch Gold can not come amiss were she a devil Yet have I gold flies from another coast- I dare not say from the rich Cardinal And from the great and new made Duke of Suffolk Yet I do find it so for to be plain They knowing Dame Eleanor 's aspiring humour Have hired me to undermine the Duchess And buzz these conjurations in her brain They say ' A crafty knave does need no broker ' Yet am I Suffolk and the Cardinal 's broker Hume if you take not heed you shall go near To call them both a pair of crafty knaves Well so its stands and thus I fear at last Hume 's knavery will be the Duchess ' wreck And her attainture will be Humphrey 's fall Sort how it will I shall have gold for all Exit My masters let 's stand close my Lord Protector will come this way by and by and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill Marry the Lord protect him for he 's a good man Jesu bless him Here ' a comes methinks and the Queen with him I 'll be the first sure Come back fool this is the Duke of Suffolk and not my Lord Protector How now fellow Wouldst anything with me I pray my lord pardon me I took ye for my Lord Protector Reads ' To my Lord Protector ' Are your supplications to his lordship Let me see them What is thine Mine is an't please your Grace against John Goodman my Lord Cardinal 's man for keeping my house and lands and wife and all from me Thy wife too That 's some wrong indeed What 's yours What 's here Reads ' Against the Duke of Suffolk for enclosing the commons of Melford ' How now sir knave Alas sir I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township Presenting his petition Against my master Thomas Horner for saying that the Duke of York was rightful heir to the crown What say'st thou Did the Duke of York say he was rightful heir to the crown That my master was No forsooth My master said that he was and that the King was an usurper Who is there Enter servant Take this fellow in and send for his master with a pursuivant presently We 'll hear more of your matter before the King And as for you that love to be protected Under the wings of our Protector 's grace Begin your suits anew and sue to him Come let 's be gone Exeunt My Lord of Suffolk say is this the guise Is this the fashions in the court of England Is this the government of Britain 's isle And this the royalty of Albion 's king What shall King Henry be a pupil still Under the surly Gloucester 's governance Am I a queen in title and in style And must be made a subject to a duke I tell thee Pole when in the city Tours Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love And stol'st away the ladies ' hearts of France I thought King Henry had resembled thee In courage courtship and proportion But all his mind is bent to holiness To number Ave Maries on his beads His champions are the prophets and apostles His weapons holy saws of sacred writ His study is his tilt yard and his loves Are brazen images of canonized saints I would the college of the Cardinals Would choose him Pope and carry him to Rome And set the triple crown upon his head That were a state fit for his holiness Madam be patient As I was cause Your Highness came to England so will I In England work your Grace 's full content Beside the haughty Protector have we Beaufort The imperious churchman Somerset Buckingham And grumbling York and not the least of these But can do more in England than the King And he of these that can do most of all Can not do more in England than the Nevils Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers Not all these lords do vex me half so much As that proud dame the Lord Protector 's wife She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies More like an empress than Duke Humphrey 's wife Strangers in court do take her for the Queen She bears a duke 's revenues on her back And in her heart she scorns our poverty Shall I not live to be aveng'd on her Contemptuous base born callet as she is She vaunted ' mongst her minions t ' other day The very train of her worst wearing gown Was better worth than all my father 's lands Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter Madam myself have lim'd a bush for her And plac'd a quire of such enticing birds That she will light to listen to the lays And never mount to trouble you again So let her rest And madam list to me For I am bold to counsel you in this Although we fancy not the Cardinal Yet must we join with him and with the lords Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace As for the Duke of York this late complaint Will make but little for his benefit So one by one we 'll weed them all at last And you yourself shall steer the happy helm For my part noble lords I care not which Or Somerset or York all 's one to me If York have ill demean'd himself in France Then let him be denay'd the regentship If Somerset be unworthy of the place Let York be Regent I will yield to him Whether your Grace be worthy yea or no Dispute not that York is the worthier Ambitious Warwick let thy betters speak The Cardinal 's not my better in the field All in this presence are thy betters Warwick Warwick may live to be the best of all Peace son And show some reason Buckingham Why Somerset should be preferr'd in this Because the King forsooth will have it so Madam the King is old enough himself To give his censure These are no women 's matters If he be old enough what needs your Grace To be Protector of his Excellence Madam I am Protector of the realm And at his pleasure will resign my place Resign it then and leave thine insolence Since thou wert king- as who is king but thou?- The commonwealth hath daily run to wrack The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas And all the peers and nobles of the realm Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty The commons hast thou rack'd the clergy 's bags Are lank and lean with thy extortions Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife 's attire Have cost a mass of public treasury Thy cruelty in execution Upon offenders hath exceeded law And left thee to the mercy of the law Thy sale of offices and towns in France If they were known as the suspect is great Would make thee quickly hop without thy head Was't I Yea I it was proud Frenchwoman Could I come near your beauty with my nails I could set my ten commandments in your face Sweet aunt be quiet ' twas against her will Against her will good King Look to ' t in time She 'll hamper thee and dandle thee like a baby Though in this place most master wear no breeches She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unreveng'd Exit Lord Cardinal I will follow Eleanor And listen after Humphrey how he proceeds She 's tickled now her fume needs no spurs She 'll gallop far enough to her destruction Exit Now lords my choler being overblown With walking once about the quadrangle I come to talk of commonwealth affairs As for your spiteful false objections Prove them and I lie open to the law But God in mercy so deal with my soul As I in duty love my king and country But to the matter that we have in hand I say my sovereign York is meetest man To be your Regent in the realm of France Before we make election give me leave To show some reason of no little force That York is most unmeet of any man I 'll tell thee Suffolk why I am unmeet First for I can not flatter thee in pride Next if I be appointed for the place My Lord of Somerset will keep me here Without discharge money or furniture Till France be won into the Dauphin 's hands Last time I danc'd attendance on his will Till Paris was besieg'd famish'd and lost That can I witness and a fouler fact Did never traitor in the land commit Peace headstrong Warwick Image of pride why should I hold my peace Because here is a man accus'd of treason Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself Doth any one accuse York for a traitor What mean'st thou Suffolk Tell me what are these Please it your Majesty this is the man That doth accuse his master of high treason His words were these that Richard Duke of York Was rightful heir unto the English crown And that your Majesty was an usurper Say man were these thy words An't shall please your Majesty I never said nor thought any such matter God is my witness I am falsely accus'd by the villain Holding up his hands By these ten bones my lords he did speak them to me in the garret one night as we were scouring my Lord of York 's armour Base dunghill villain and mechanical I 'll have thy head for this thy traitor 's speech I do beseech your royal Majesty Let him have all the rigour of the law Uncle what shall we say to this in law This doom my lord if I may judge Let Somerset be Regent o'er the French Because in York this breeds suspicion And let these have a day appointed them For single combat in convenient place For he hath witness of his servant 's malice This is the law and this Duke Humphrey 's doom I humbly thank your royal Majesty And I accept the combat willingly Alas my lord I can not fight for God 's sake pity my case The spite of man prevaileth against me O Lord have mercy upon me I shall never be able to fight a blow O Lord my heart Sirrah or you must fight or else be hang'd Away with them to prison and the day of combat shall be the last of the next month Come Somerset we 'll see thee sent away Flourish Exeunt Come my masters the Duchess I tell you expects performance of your promises Master Hume we are therefore provided will her ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms Ay what else Fear you not her courage I have heard her reported to be a woman of an invincible spirit but it shall be convenient Master Hume that you be by her aloft while we be busy below and so I pray you go in God 's name and leave us Exit HUME Mother Jourdain be you prostrate and grovel on the earth John Southwell read you and let us to our work Well said my masters and welcome all To this gear the sooner the better Patience good lady wizards know their times Deep night dark night the silent of the night The time of night when Troy was set on fire The time when screech owls cry and ban dogs howl

all forthcoming All away Lord Buckingham methinks you watch'd her well A pretty plot well chosen to build upon Now pray my lord let 's see the devil 's writ What have we here Reads ' The duke yet

flying at the brook I saw not better sport these seven years ' day Yet by your leave the wind was very high And ten to one old Joan had not gone out But what a point my lord your falcon made And what

know their master loves to be aloft And bears his thoughts above his falcon 's pitch My lord ' tis but a base ignoble mind That mounts no higher than a bird can soar I thought as much he would be

Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to day True made the lame to leap and fly away But you have done more miracles than I You made in a day my lord whole towns to fly What tidings with our cousin Buckingham Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold A sort of naughty persons lewdly bent Under the countenance and confederacy Of Lady Eleanor the Protector 's wife The ringleader and head of all this rout Have practis'd dangerously against your state Dealing with witches and with conjurers Whom we have apprehended in the fact Raising up wicked spirits from under ground Demanding of King Henry 's life and death And other of your Highness ' Privy Council As more at large your Grace shall understand And so my Lord Protector by this means Your lady is forthcoming yet at London This news I think hath turn'd your weapon 's edge ' Tis like my lord you will not keep your hour Ambitious churchman leave to afflict my heart Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers And vanquish'd as I am I yield to the Or to the meanest groom O God what mischiefs work the wicked ones Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby Gloucester see here the tainture of thy nest And look thyself be faultless thou wert best Madam for myself to heaven I do appeal How I have lov'd my King and commonweal And for my wife I know not how it stands Sorry I am to hear what I have heard Noble she is but if she have forgot Honour and virtue and convers'd with such As like to pitch defile nobility I banish her my bed and company And give her as a prey to law and shame That hath dishonoured Gloucester 's honest name Well for this night we will repose us here To morrow toward London back again To look into this business thoroughly And call these foul offenders to their answers And poise the cause in justice ' equal scales Whose beam stands sure whose rightful cause prevails Now my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick Our simple supper ended give me leave In this close walk to satisfy myself In craving your opinion of my tide Which is infallible to England 's crown My lord I long to hear it at full Sweet York begin and if thy claim be good The Nevils are thy subjects to command Then thus Edward the Third my lords had seven sons The first Edward the Black Prince Prince of Wales The second William of Hatfield and the third Lionel Duke of Clarence next to whom Was John of Gaunt the Duke of Lancaster The fifth was Edmund Langley Duke of York The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock Duke of Gloucester William of Windsor was the seventh and last Edward the Black Prince died before his father And left behind him Richard his only son Who after Edward the Third 's death reign'd as king Till Henry Bolingbroke Duke of Lancaster The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth Seiz'd on the realm depos'd the rightful king Sent his poor queen to France from whence she came And him to Pomfret where as all you know Harmless Richard was murdered traitorously Father the Duke hath told the truth Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown Which now they hold by force and not by right For Richard the first son 's heir being dead The issue of the next son should have reign'd But William of Hatfield died without an heir The third son Duke of Clarence from whose line I claim the crown had issue Philippe a daughter Who married Edmund Mortimer Earl of March Edmund had issue Roger Earl of March Roger had issue Edmund Anne and Eleanor This Edmund in the reign of Bolingbroke As I have read laid claim unto the crown And but for Owen Glendower had been king Who kept him in captivity till he died But to the rest His eldest sister Anne My mother being heir unto the crown Married Richard Earl of Cambridge who was To Edmund Langley Edward the Third 's fifth son son By her I claim the kingdom she was heir To Roger Earl of March who was the son Of Edmund Mortimer who married Philippe Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence So if the issue of the elder son Succeed before the younger I am King What plain proceedings is more plain than this Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt The fourth son York claims it from the third Till Lionel 's issue fails his should not reign It fails not yet but flourishes in thee And in thy sons fair slips of such a stock Then father Salisbury kneel we together And in this private plot be we the first That shall salute our rightful sovereign With honour of his birthright to the crown Long live our sovereign Richard England 's King We thank you lords But I am not your king Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd With heart blood of the house of Lancaster And that 's not suddenly to be perform'd But with advice and silent secrecy Do you as I do in these dangerous days Wink at the Duke of Suffolk 's insolence At Beaufort 's pride at Somerset 's ambition At Buckingham and all the crew of them Till they have snar'd the shepherd of the flock That virtuous prince the good Duke Humphrey ' Tis that they seek and they in seeking that Shall find their deaths if York can prophesy My lord break we off we know your mind at full My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick Shall one day make the Duke of York a king And Nevil this I do assure myself Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick The greatest man in England but the King Exeunt Stand forth Dame Eleanor Cobham Gloucester 's wife In sight of God and us your guilt is great Receive the sentence of the law for sins Such as by God 's book are adjudg'd to death You four from hence to prison back again From thence unto the place of execution The witch in Smithfield shall be burnt to ashes And you three shall be strangled on the gallows You madam for you are more nobly born Despoiled of your honour in your life Shall after three days ' open penance

law condemns Stay Humphrey Duke of Gloucester ere thou go Give up thy staff Henry will to himself Protector be and God shall be my hope My stay my guide and lantern to my feet And go in peace Humphrey no less belov'd Than when thou wert Protector to thy King I see no reason why a king of years Should be to be protected like a child God and King Henry govern England 's realm Give up your staff sir and the King his realm My staff Here noble Henry is my staff As willingly do I the same resign As ere thy father Henry made it mine And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it As others would ambitiously receive it Farewell good King when I am dead and gone May honourable peace attend thy throne Exit Why now is Henry King and Margaret Queen And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself That bears so shrewd a maim two pulls at once- His lady banish'd and a limb lopp'd off This staff of honour raught there let it stand Where it best fits to be in Henry 's hand Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays Thus Eleanor 's pride dies in her youngest days Lords let him go Please it your Majesty This is the day appointed for the combat And ready are the appellant and defendant The armourer and his man to enter the lists So please your Highness to behold the fight Ay good my lord for purposely therefore Left I the court to see this quarrel tried A God 's name see the lists and all things fit Here let them end it and God defend the right I never saw a fellow worse bested Or more afraid to fight than is the appellant The servant of his armourer my lords Here neighbour Horner

Peter What more Thump Thump Then see thou thump thy master well Masters I am come hither as it were upon my man 's instigation to prove him a knave and myself an honest man and touching the Duke of York I will take my death I never meant him any ill nor the King nor the Queen and therefore Peter have at thee with a down right blow Dispatch- this knave 's tongue begins to double Sound trumpets alarum to the combatants Hold Peter hold I confess I confess treason Take away his weapon Fellow thank God and the good wine in thy master 's way O God have I overcome mine enemies in this presence O Peter thou hast prevail'd in right Go take hence that traitor from our sight For by his death we do perceive his guilt And God in justice hath reveal'd to us The truth and innocence of this poor fellow Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully Come fellow follow us for thy reward Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud And after summer evermore succeeds Barren winter with his wrathful nipping cold So cares and joys abound as seasons fleet Sirs what 's o'clock Ten is the hour that was appointed me To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess Uneath may she endure the flinty streets To tread them with her tender feeling feet Sweet Nell ill can thy noble mind abrook The abject people gazing on thy face With envious looks laughing at thy shame That erst did follow thy proud chariot wheels When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets But soft I think she comes and I 'll prepare My tear stain'd eyes to see her miseries No stir not for your lives let her pass by Come you my lord to see my open shame Now thou dost penance too Look how they gaze See how the giddy multitude do point And nod their heads and throw their eyes on thee Ah Gloucester hide thee from their hateful looks And in thy closet pent up rue my shame And ban thine enemies both mine and thine Be patient gentle Nell forget this grief Ah Gloucester teach me to forget myself For whilst I think I am thy married wife And thou a prince Protector of this land Methinks I should not thus be led along Mail'd up in shame with papers on my back And follow'd with a rabble that rejoice To see my tears and hear my deep fet groans The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet And when I start the envious people laugh And bid me be advised how I tread Ah Humphrey can I bear this shameful yoke Trowest thou that e'er I 'll look upon the world Or count them happy that enjoy the sun No dark shall be my light and night my day To think upon my pomp shall be my hell Sometimes I 'll say I am Duke Humphrey 's wife And he a prince and ruler of the land Yet so he rul'd and such a prince he was As he stood by whilst I his forlorn duchess Was made a wonder and a pointing stock To every idle rascal follower But be thou mild and blush not at my shame Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death Hang over thee as sure it shortly will For Suffolk- he that can do all in all With her that hateth thee and hates us all- And York and impious Beaufort that false priest Have all lim'd bushes to betray thy wings And fly thou how thou canst they 'll tangle thee But fear not thou until thy foot be snar'd Nor never seek prevention of thy foes Ah Nell forbear Thou aimest all awry I must offend before I be attainted And had I twenty times so many foes And each of them had twenty times their power All these could not procure me any scathe So long as I am loyal true and crimeless Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach Why yet thy scandal were not wip'd away But I in danger for the breach of law Thy greatest help is quiet gentle Nell I pray thee sort thy heart to patience These few days ' wonder will be quickly worn I summon your Grace to his Majesty 's Parliament Holden at Bury the first of this next month And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before This is close dealing Well I will be there Exit HERALD My Nell I take my leave- and master sheriff Let not her penance exceed the King 's commission

Sheriff farewell and better than I fare Although thou hast been conduct of my shame It is my office and madam pardon me Ay ay farewell thy office is discharg'd Come Stanley shall we go Madam your penance done throw off this sheet And go we to attire you for our journey My shame will not be shifted with my sheet No it will hang upon my richest robes And show itself attire me how I can Go lead the way I long to see my prison Exeunt I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come ' Tis not his wo nt to be the hindmost man Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now Can you not see or will ye not observe The strangeness of his alter'd countenance With what a majesty he bears himself How insolent of late he is become How proud how peremptory and unlike himself We know the time since he was mild and affable And if we did but glance a far off look Immediately he was upon his knee That all the court admir'd him for submission But meet him now and be it in the morn When every one will give the time of day He knits his brow and shows an angry eye And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee Disdaining duty that to us belongs Small curs are not regarded when they grin But great men tremble when the lion roars And Humphrey is no little man in England First note that he is near you in descent And should you fall he is the next will mount Me seemeth then it is no policy- Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears And his advantage following your decease- That he should come about your royal person Or be admitted to your Highness ' Council By flattery hath he won the commons ' hearts And when he please to make commotion ' Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him Now ' tis the spring and weeds are shallow rooted Suffer them now and they 'll o'ergrow the garden And choke the herbs for want of husbandry The reverent care I bear unto my lord Made me collect these dangers in the Duke If it be fond can it a woman 's fear Which fear if better reasons can supplant I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the Duke My Lord of Suffolk Buckingham and York Reprove my allegation if you can Or else conclude my words effectual Well hath your Highness seen into this duke And had I first been put to speak my mind I think I should have told your Grace 's tale The Duchess by his subornation Upon my life began her devilish practices Or if he were not privy to those faults Yet by reputing of his high descent- As next the King he was successive heir- And such high vaunts of his nobility Did instigate the bedlam brainsick Duchess By wicked means to frame our sovereign 's fall Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep And in his simple show he harbours treason The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb No no my sovereign Gloucester is a man Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit Did he not contrary to form of law Devise strange deaths for small offences done And did he not in his protectorship Levy great sums of money through the realm For soldiers ' pay in France and never sent it By means whereof the towns each day revolted Tut these are petty faults to faults unknown Which time will bring to light in smooth Duke Humphrey My lords at once the care you have of us To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot Is worthy praise but shall I speak my conscience Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent From meaning treason to our royal person As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove The Duke is virtuous mild and too well given To dream on evil or to work my downfall Ah what 's more dangerous than this fond affiance Seems he a dove His feathers are but borrow'd For he 's disposed as the hateful raven Is he a lamb His skin is surely lent him For he 's inclin'd as is the ravenous wolf Who can not steal a shape that means deceit Take heed my lord the welfare of us all Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man All health unto my gracious sovereign Welcome Lord Somerset What news from France That all your interest in those territories Is utterly bereft you all is lost Cold news Lord Somerset but God 's will be done Aside Cold news for me for I had hope of France As firmly as I hope for fertile England Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud And caterpillars eat my leaves away But I will remedy this gear ere long Or sell my title for a glorious grave All happiness unto my lord the King Pardon my liege that I have stay'd so long Nay Gloucester know that thou art come too soon Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art I do arrest thee of high treason here Well Suffolk thou shalt not see me blush Nor change my countenance for this arrest A heart unspotted is not easily daunted The purest spring is not so free from mud As I am clear from treason to my sovereign Who can accuse me Wherein am I guilty ' Tis thought my lord that you took bribes of France And being Protector stay'd the soldiers ' pay By means whereof his Highness hath lost France Is it but thought so What are they that think it I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay Nor ever had one penny bribe from France So help me God as I have watch'd the night- Ay night by night- in studying good for England That doit that e'er I wrested from the King Or any groat I hoarded to my use Be brought against me at my trial day No many a pound of mine own proper store Because I would not tax the needy commons Have I dispursed to the garrisons And never ask'd for restitution It serves you well my lord to say so much I say no more than truth so help me God In your protectorship you did devise Strange tortures for offenders never heard of That England was defam'd by tyranny Why ' tis well known that whiles I was Protector Pity was all the fault that was in me For I should melt at an offender 's tears And lowly words were ransom for their fault Unless it were a bloody murderer Or foul felonious thief that fleec'd poor passengers I never gave them condign punishment Murder indeed that bloody sin I tortur'd Above the felon or what trespass else My lord these faults are easy quickly answer'd But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge Whereof you can not easily purge yourself I do arrest you in His Highness ' name And here commit you to my Lord Cardinal To keep until your further time of trial My Lord of Gloucester ' tis my special hope That you will clear yourself from all suspense My conscience tells me you are innocent Ah gracious lord these days are dangerous Virtue is chok'd with foul ambition And charity chas'd hence by rancour 's hand Foul subornation is predominant And equity exil'd your Highness ' land I know their complot is to have my life And if my death might make this island happy And prove the period of their tyranny I would expend it with all willingness But mine is made the prologue to their play For thousands more that yet suspect no peril Will not conclude their plotted tragedy Beaufort 's red sparkling eyes blab his heart 's malice And Suffolk 's cloudy brow his stormy hate Sharp Buckingham unburdens with his tongue The envious load that lies upon his heart And dogged York that reaches at the moon Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back By false accuse doth level at my life And you my sovereign lady with the rest Causeless have laid disgraces on my head And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up My liefest liege to be mine enemy Ay all of you have laid your heads together- Myself had notice of your conventicles- And all to make away my guiltless life I shall not want false witness to condemn me Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt The ancient proverb will be well effected ' A staff is quickly found to beat a dog ' My liege his railing is intolerable If those that care to keep your royal person From treason 's secret knife and traitor 's rage Be thus upbraided chid and rated at And the offender granted scope of speech ' Twill make them cool in zeal unto your Grace Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here With ignominious words though clerkly couch'd As if she had suborned some to swear False allegations to o'erthrow his state But I can give the loser leave to chide Far truer spoke than meant I lose indeed Beshrew the winners for they play'd me false And well such losers may have leave to speak He 'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day Lord Cardinal he is your prisoner Sirs take away the Duke and guard him sure Ah thus King Henry throws away his crutch Before his legs be firm to bear his body Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first Ah that my fear were false ah that it were For good King Henry thy decay I fear Exit guarded My lords what to your wisdoms seemeth best Do or undo as if ourself were here What will your Highness leave the Parliament Ay Margaret my heart is drown'd with grief Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes My body round engirt with misery- For what 's more miserable than discontent Ah uncle Humphrey in thy face I see The map of honour truth and loyalty And yet good Humphrey is the hour to come That e'er I prov'd thee false or fear'd thy faith What louring star now envies thy estate That these great lords and Margaret our Queen Do seek subversion of thy harmless life Thou never didst them wrong nor no man wrong And as the butcher takes away the calf And binds the wretch and beats it when it strays Bearing it to the bloody slaughter house Even so remorseless have they borne him hence And as the dam runs lowing up and down Looking the way her harmless young one went And can do nought but wail her darling 's loss Even so myself bewails good Gloucester 's case With sad unhelpful tears and with dimm'd eyes Look after him and can not do him good So mighty are his vowed enemies His fortunes I will weep and ' twixt each groan Say ' Who 's a traitor Gloucester he is none ' Exit Free lords cold snow melts with the sun 's hot beams Henry my lord is cold in great affairs Too full of foolish pity and Gloucester 's show Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile With sorrow snares relenting passengers Or as the snake roll'd in a flow'ring bank With shining checker'd slough doth sting a child That for the beauty thinks it excellent Believe me lords were none more wise than I- And yet herein I judge mine own wit good- This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world To rid us from the fear we have of him That he should die is worthy policy But yet we want a colour for his death ' Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law But in my mind that were no policy The King will labour still to save his life The commons haply rise to save his life And yet we have but trivial argument More than mistrust that shows him worthy death So that by this you would not have him die Ah York no man alive so fain as I ' Tis York that hath more reason for his death But my Lord Cardinal and you my Lord of Suffolk Say as you think and speak it from your souls Were't not all one an empty eagle were set To guard the chicken from a hungry kite As place Duke Humphrey for the King 's Protector So the poor chicken should be sure of death Madam ' tis true and were't not madness then To make the fox surveyor of the fold Who being accus'd a crafty murderer His guilt should be but idly posted over Because his purpose is not executed No let him die in that he is a fox By nature prov'd an enemy to the flock Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood As Humphrey prov'd by reasons to my liege And do not stand on quillets how to slay him Be it by gins by snares by subtlety Sleeping or waking ' tis no matter how So he be dead for that is good deceit Which mates him first that first intends deceit Thrice noble Suffolk ' tis resolutely spoke Not resolute except so much were done For things are often spoke and seldom meant But that my heart accordeth with my tongue Seeing the deed is meritorious And to preserve my sovereign from his foe Say but the word and I will be his priest But I would have him dead my Lord of Suffolk Ere you can take due orders for a priest Say you consent and censure well the deed And I 'll provide his executioner- I tender so the safety of my liege Here is my hand the deed is worthy doing And so say I. And I. And now we three have spoke it It skills not greatly who impugns our doom Great lords from Ireland am I come amain To signify that rebels there are up And put the Englishmen unto the sword Send succours lords and stop the rage betime Before the wound do grow uncurable For being green there is great hope of help A breach that craves a quick expedient stop What counsel give you in this weighty cause That Somerset be sent as Regent thither ' Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd Witness the fortune he hath had in France If York with all his far fet policy Had been the Regent there instead of me He never would have stay'd in France so long No not to lose it all as thou hast done I rather would have lost my life betimes Than bring a burden of dishonour home By staying there so long till all were lost Show me one scar character'd on thy skin Men 's flesh preserv'd so whole do seldom win Nay then this spark will prove a raging fire If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with No more good York sweet Somerset be still Thy fortune York hadst thou been Regent there Might happily have prov'd far worse than his What worse than nought Nay then a shame take all And in the number thee that wishest shame My Lord of York try what your fortune is Th ' uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms And temper clay with blood of Englishmen To Ireland will you lead a band of men Collected choicely from each county some And try your hap against the Irishmen I will my lord so please his Majesty Why our authority is his consent And what we do establish he confirms Then noble York take thou this task in hand I am content provide me soldiers lords Whiles I take order for mine own affairs A charge Lord York that I will see perform'd But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey No more of him for I will deal with him That henceforth he shall trouble us no more And so break off the day is almost spent Lord Suffolk you and I must talk of that event My Lord of Suffolk within fourteen days At Bristol I expect my soldiers For there I 'll ship them all for Ireland I 'll see it truly done my Lord of York Now York or never steel thy fearful thoughts And change misdoubt to resolution Be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art Resign to death- it is not worth th ' enjoying Let pale fac'd fear keep with the mean born man And find no harbour in a royal heart Faster than spring time show'rs comes thought on thought And not a thought but thinks on dignity My brain more busy than the labouring spider Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies Well nobles well ' tis politicly done To send me packing with an host of men I fear me you but warm the starved snake Who cherish'd in your breasts will sting your hearts ' Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me I take it kindly Yet be well assur'd You put sharp weapons in a madman 's hands Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band I will stir up in England some black storm Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage Until the golden circuit on my head Like to the glorious sun 's transparent beams Do calm the fury of this mad bred flaw And for a minister of my intent I have seduc'd a headstrong Kentishman John Cade of Ashford To make commotion as full well he can Under the tide of John Mortimer In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade Oppose himself against a troop of kerns And fought so long tiff that his thighs with darts Were almost like a sharp quill'd porpentine And in the end being rescu'd I have seen Him caper upright like a wild Morisco Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells Full often like a shag hair'd crafty kern Hath he conversed with the enemy And undiscover'd come to me again And given me notice of their villainies This devil here shall be my substitute For that John Mortimer which now is dead In face in gait in speech he doth resemble By this I shall perceive the commons ' mind How they affect the house and claim of York Say he be taken rack'd and tortured I know no pain they can inflict upon him Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms Say that he thrive as ' tis great like he will Why then from Ireland come I with my strength And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd For Humphrey being dead as he shall be And Henry put apart the next for me Exit Run to my Lord of Suffolk let him know We have dispatch'd the Duke as he commanded O that it were to do What have we done Didst ever hear a man so penitent Here comes my lord Now sirs have you dispatch'd this thing Ay my good lord he 's dead Why that 's well said Go get you to my house I will reward you for this venturous deed The King and all the peers are here at hand Have you laid fair the bed Is all things well According as I gave directions ' Tis my good lord Away be gone Exeunt MURDERERS Go call our uncle to our presence straight Say we intend to try his Grace to day If he be guilty as ' tis published I 'll call him presently my noble lord Exit Lords take your places and I pray you all Proceed no straiter ' gainst our uncle Gloucester Than from true evidence of good esteem He be approv'd in practice culpable God forbid any malice should prevail That faultless may condemn a nobleman Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion I thank thee Meg these words content me much Dead in his bed my lord Gloucester is dead Marry God forfend God 's secret judgment I did dream to night The Duke was dumb and could not speak a word How fares my lord Help lords The King is dead Rear up his body wring him by the nose Run go help help O Henry ope thine eyes He doth revive again madam be patient O heavenly God How fares my gracious lord Comfort my sovereign Gracious Henry comfort What doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me Came he right now to sing a raven 's note Whose dismal tune bereft my vital pow'rs And thinks he that the chirping of a wren By crying comfort from a hollow breast Can chase away the first conceived sound Hide not thy poison with such sug'red words Lay not thy hands on me forbear I say Their touch affrights me as a serpent 's sting Thou baleful messenger out of my sight Upon thy eye balls murderous tyranny Sits in grim majesty to fright the world Look not upon me for thine eyes are wounding Yet do not go away come basilisk And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight For in the shade of death I shall find joy- In life but double death,'now Gloucester 's dead Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus Although the Duke was enemy to him Yet he most Christian like laments his death And for myself- foe as he was to me- Might liquid tears or heart offending groans Or blood consuming sighs recall his life I would be blind with weeping sick with groans Look pale as primrose with blood drinking sighs And all to have the noble Duke alive What know I how the world may deem of me For it is known we were but hollow friends It may be judg'd I made the Duke away So shall my name with slander 's tongue be wounded And princes ' courts be fill'd with my reproach This get I by his death Ay me unhappy To be a queen and crown'd with infamy Ah woe is me for Gloucester wretched man Be woe for me more wretched than he is What dost thou turn away and hide thy face I am no loathsome leper- look on me What art thou like the adder waxen deaf Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn Queen Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester 's tomb Why then Dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy Erect his statue and worship it And make my image but an alehouse sign Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea And twice by awkward wind from England 's bank Drove back again unto my native clime What boded this but well forewarning wind Did seem to say ' Seek not a scorpion 's nest Nor set no footing on this unkind shore ' What did I then but curs'd the gentle gusts And he that loos'd them forth their brazen caves And bid them blow towards England 's blessed shore Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer But left that hateful office unto thee The pretty vaulting sea refus'd to drown me Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore With tears as salt as sea through thy unkindness The splitting rocks cow'r'd in the sinking sands And would not dash me with their ragged sides Because thy flinty heart more hard than they Might in thy palace perish Margaret As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs When from thy shore the tempest beat us back I stood upon the hatches in the storm And when the dusky sky began to rob My earnest gaping sight of thy land 's view I took a costly jewel from my neck- A heart it was bound in with diamonds- And threw it towards thy land The sea receiv'd it And so I wish'd thy body might my heart And even with this I lost fair England 's view And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles For losing ken of Albion 's wished coast How often have I tempted Suffolk 's tongue- The agent of thy foul inconstancy- To sit and witch me as Ascanius did When he to madding Dido would unfold His father 's acts commenc'd in burning Troy Am I not witch'd like her Or thou not false like him Ay me I can no more Die Margaret For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long It is reported mighty sovereign That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murd'red By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort 's means The commons like an angry hive of bees That want their leader scatter up and down And care not who they sting in his revenge Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny Until they hear the order of his death That he is dead good Warwick ' tis too true But how he died God knows not Henry Enter his chamber view his breathless corpse And comment then upon his sudden death That shall I do my liege Stay Salisbury With the rude multitude till I return Exit O Thou that judgest all things stay my thoughts- My thoughts that labour to persuade my soul Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey 's life If my suspect be false forgive me God For judgment only doth belong to Thee Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips With twenty thousand kisses and to drain Upon his face an ocean of salt tears To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk And with my fingers feel his hand un feeling But all in vain are these mean obsequies And to survey his dead and earthy image What were it but to make my sorrow greater Come hither gracious sovereign view this body That is to see how deep my grave is made For with his soul fled all my worldly solace For seeing him I see my life in death As surely as my soul intends to live With that dread King that took our state upon Him To free us from his Father 's wrathful curse I do believe that violent hands were laid Upon the life of this thrice famed Duke A dreadful oath sworn with a solemn tongue What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow See how the blood is settled in his face Oft have I seen a timely parted ghost Of ashy semblance meagre pale and bloodless Being all descended to the labouring heart Who in the conflict that it holds with death Attracts the same for aidance ' gainst the enemy Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth To blush and beautify the cheek again But see his face is black and full of blood His eye balls further out than when he liv'd Staring full ghastly like a strangled man His hair uprear'd his nostrils stretch'd with struggling His hands abroad display'd as one that grasp'd And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdu'd Look on the sheets his hair you see is sticking His well proportion'd beard made rough and rugged Like to the summer 's corn by tempest lodged It can not be but he was murd'red here The least of all these signs were probable Why Warwick who should do the Duke to death Myself and Beaufort had him in protection And we I hope sir are no murderers But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey 's foes And you forsooth had the good Duke to keep ' Tis like you would not feast him like a friend And ' tis well seen he found an enemy Then you belike suspect these noblemen As guilty of Duke Humphrey 's timeless death Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh And sees fast by a butcher with an axe But will suspect ' twas he that made the slaughter Who finds the partridge in the puttock 's nest But may imagine how the bird was dead Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak Even so suspicious is this tragedy Are you the butcher Suffolk Where 's your knife Is Beaufort term'd a kite Where are his talons I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men But here 's a vengeful sword rusted with ease That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart That slanders me with murder 's crimson badge Say if thou dar'st proud Lord of Warwickshire That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey 's death What dares not Warwick if false Suffolk dare him He dares not calm his contumelious spirit Nor cease to be an arrogant controller Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times Madam be still- with reverence may I say For every word you speak in his behalf Is slander to your royal dignity Blunt witted lord ignoble in demeanour If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much Thy mother took into her blameful bed Some stern untutor'd churl and noble stock Was graft with crab tree slip whose fruit thou art And never of the Nevils ' noble race But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee And I should rob the deathsman of his fee Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames And that my sovereign 's presence makes me mild I would false murd'rous coward on thy knee Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st That thou thyself was born in bastardy And after all this fearful homage done Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell Pernicious blood sucker of sleeping men Thou shalt be waking while I shed thy blood If from this presence thou dar'st go with me Away even now or I will drag thee hence Unworthy though thou art I 'll cope with thee And do some service to Duke Humphrey 's ghost What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted Thrice is he arm'd that hath his quarrel just And he but naked though lock'd up in steel Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted What noise is this Why how now lords your wrathful weapons drawn Here in our presence Dare you be so bold Why what tumultuous clamour have we here The trait'rous Warwick with the men of Bury Set all upon me mighty sovereign To the Commons within Sirs stand apart the King Within An answer from the King my Lord of Salisbury ' Tis like the commons rude unpolish'd hinds Could send such message to their sovereign But you my lord were glad to be employ'd To show how quaint an orator you are But all the honour Salisbury hath won Is that he was the lord ambassador Sent from a sort of tinkers to the King Within An answer from the King or we will all break in Go Salisbury and tell them all from me I thank them for their tender loving care And had I not been cited so by them Yet did I purpose as they do entreat For sure my thoughts do hourly prophesy Mischance unto my state by Suffolk 's means And therefore by His Majesty I swear Whose far unworthy deputy I am He shall not breathe infection in this air But three days longer on the pain of death O Henry let me plead for gentle Suffolk Ungentle Queen to call him gentle Suffolk No more I say if thou dost plead for him Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath Had I but said I would have kept my word But when I swear it is irrevocable If after three days ' space thou here be'st found On any ground that I am ruler of The world shall not be ransom for thy life Come Warwick come good Warwick go with me I have great matters to impart to thee Mischance and sorrow go along with you Heart 's discontent and sour affliction Be playfellows to keep you company There 's two of you the devil make a third And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps Cease gentle Queen these execrations And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave Fie coward woman and soft hearted wretch Has thou not spirit to curse thine enemy A plague upon them Wherefore should I curse them Would curses kill as doth the mandrake 's groan I would invent as bitter searching terms As curst as harsh and horrible to hear Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth With full as many signs of deadly hate As lean fac'd Envy in her loathsome cave My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint Mine hair be fix'd an end as one distract Ay every joint should seem to curse and ban And even now my burden'd heart would break Should I not curse them Poison be their drink Gall worse than gall the daintiest that they taste Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees Their chiefest prospect murd'ring basilisks Their softest touch as smart as lizards ' stings Their music frightful as the serpent 's hiss And boding screech owls make the consort full all the foul terrors in dark seated hell- Enough sweet Suffolk thou torment'st thyself And these dread curses like the sun ' gainst glass Or like an overcharged gun recoil And turns the force of them upon thyself You bade me ban and will you bid me leave Now by the ground that I am banish'd from Well could I curse away a winter 's night Though standing naked on a mountain top Where biting cold would never let grass grow And think it but a minute spent in sport O let me entreat thee cease Give me thy hand That I may dew it with my mournful tears Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place To wash away my woeful monuments O could this kiss be printed in thy hand That thou might'st think upon these by the seal Through whom a thousand sighs are breath'd for thee So get thee gone that I may know my grief ' Tis but surmis'd whiles thou art standing by As one that surfeits thinking on a want I will repeal thee or be well assur'd Adventure to be banished myself And banished I am if but from thee Go speak not to me even now be gone O go not yet Even thus two friends condemn'd Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves Loather a hundred times to part than die Yet now farewell and farewell life with thee Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished Once by the King and three times thrice by thee ' Tis not the land I care for wert thou thence A wilderness is populous enough So Suffolk had thy heavenly company For where thou art there is the world itself With every several pleasure in the world And where thou art not desolation I can no more Live thou to joy thy life Myself no joy in nought but that thou liv'st Whither goes Vaux so fast What news I prithee To signify unto his Majesty That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death For suddenly a grievous sickness took him That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth Sometime he talks as if Duke Humphrey 's ghost Were by his side sometime he calls the King And whispers to his pillow as to him The secrets of his overcharged soul And I am sent to tell his Majesty That even now he cries aloud for him Go tell this heavy message to the King Exit VAUX Ay me What is this world What news are these But wherefore grieve I at an hour 's poor loss Omitting Suffolk 's exile my soul 's treasure Why only Suffolk mourn I not for thee And with the southern clouds contend in tears- Theirs for the earth 's increase mine for my sorrows Now get thee hence the King thou know'st is coming If thou be found by me thou art but dead If I depart from thee I can not live And in thy sight to die what were it else But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap Here could I breathe my soul into the air As mild and gentle as the cradle babe Dying with mother 's dug between its lips Where from thy sight I should be raging mad And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul Or I should breathe it so into thy body And then it liv'd in sweet Elysium To die by thee were but to die in jest From thee to die were torture more than death O let me stay befall what may befall Away Though parting be a fretful corrosive It is applied to a deathful wound To France sweet Suffolk Let me hear from thee For whereso'er thou art in this world 's globe I 'll have an Iris that shall find thee out I go And take my heart with thee She kisses him A jewel lock'd into the woefull'st cask That ever did contain a thing of worth Even as a splitted bark so sunder we This way fall I to death This way for me Exeunt severally How fares my lord Speak Beaufort to thy sovereign If thou be'st Death I 'll give thee England 's treasure Enough to purchase such another island So thou wilt let me live and feel no pain Ah what a sign it is of evil life Where death 's approach is seen so terrible Beaufort it is thy sovereign speaks to thee Bring me unto my trial when you will Died he not in his bed Where should he die Can I make men live whe'er they will or no O torture me no more I will confess Alive again Then show me where he is I 'll give a thousand pound to look upon him He hath no eyes the dust hath blinded them Comb down his hair look look it stands upright Like lime twigs set to catch my winged soul Give me some drink and bid the apothecary Bring the strong poison that I bought of him O Thou eternal Mover of the heavens Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch O beat away the busy meddling fiend That lays strong siege unto this wretch 's soul And from his bosom purge this black despair See how the pangs of death do make him grin Disturb him not let him pass peaceably Peace to his soul if God 's good pleasure be Lord Card'nal if thou think'st on heaven 's bliss Hold up thy hand make signal of thy hope He dies and makes no sign O God forgive him So bad a death argues a monstrous life Forbear to judge for we are sinners all Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close And let us all to meditation Exeunt The gaudy blabbing and remorseful day Is crept into the bosom of the sea And now loud howling wolves arouse the jades That drag the tragic melancholy night Who with their drowsy slow and flagging wings Clip dead men 's graves and from their misty jaws Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize For whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs Here shall they make their ransom on the sand Or with their blood stain this discoloured shore Master this prisoner freely give I thee And thou that art his mate make boot of this The other Walter Whitmore is thy share What is my ransom master let me know A thousand crowns or else lay down your head And so much shall you give or off goes yours What think you much to pay two thousand crowns And bear the name and port of gentlemen Cut both the villains ' throats- for die you shall The lives of those which we have lost in fight Be counterpois'd with such a petty sum I 'll give it sir and therefore spare my life And so will I and write home for it straight I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard To SUFFOLK And therefore to revenge it shalt thou die And so should these if I might have my will Be not so rash take ransom let him live Look on my George I am a gentleman Rate me at what thou wilt thou shalt be paid And so am I my name is Walter Whitmore How now Why start'st thou What doth death affright Thy name affrights me in whose sound is death A cunning man did calculate my birth And told me that by water I should die Yet let not this make thee be bloody minded Thy name is Gualtier being rightly sounded Gualtier or Walter which it is I care not Never yet did base dishonour blur our name But with our sword we wip'd away the blot Therefore when merchant like I sell revenge Broke be my sword my arms torn and defac'd And I proclaim'd a coward through the world Stay Whitmore for thy prisoner is a prince The Duke of Suffolk William de la Pole The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags Ay but these rags are no part of the Duke Jove sometime went disguis'd and why not I But Jove was never slain as thou shalt be Obscure and lowly swain King Henry 's blood The honourable blood of Lancaster Must not be shed by such a jaded groom Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup Bareheaded plodded by my foot cloth mule And thought thee happy when I shook my head How often hast thou waited at my cup Fed from my trencher kneel'd down at the board When I have feasted with Queen Margaret Remember it and let it make thee crestfall'n Ay and allay thus thy abortive pride How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood And duly waited for my coming forth This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue Speak Captain shall I stab the forlorn swain First let my words stab him as he hath me Base slave thy words are blunt and so art thou Convey him hence and on our longboat 's side Strike off his head Thou dar'st not for thy own Poole Poole Ay kennel puddle sink whose filth and dirt Troubles the silver spring where England drinks Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth For swallowing the treasure of the realm Thy lips that kiss'd the Queen shall sweep the ground And thou that smil'dst at good Duke Humphrey 's death Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again And wedded be thou to the hags of hell For daring to affy a mighty lord Unto the daughter of a worthless king Having neither subject wealth nor diadem By devilish policy art thou grown great And like ambitious Sylla overgorg'd With gobbets of thy mother 's bleeding heart By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France The false revolting Normans thorough thee Disdain to call us lord and Picardy Hath slain their governors surpris'd our forts And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home The princely Warwick and the Nevils all Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain As hating thee are rising up in arms And now the house of York- thrust from the crown By shameful murder of a guiltless king And lofty proud encroaching tyranny- Burns with revenging fire whose hopeful colours Advance our half fac'd sun striving to shine Under the which is writ ' Invitis nubibus ' The commons here in Kent are up in arms And to conclude reproach and beggary Is crept into the palace of our King And all by thee Away convey him hence O that I were a god to shoot forth thunder Upon these paltry servile abject drudges Small things make base men proud this villain here Being captain of a pinnace threatens more Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate Drones suck not eagles ' blood but rob beehives It is impossible that I should die By such a lowly vassal as thyself Thy words move rage and not remorse in me I go of message from the Queen to France I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel Walter- Come Suffolk I must waft thee to thy death Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee What are ye daunted now Now will ye stoop My gracious lord entreat him speak him fair Suffolk 's imperial tongue is stem and rough Us'd to command untaught to plead for favour Far be it we should honour such as these With humble suit no rather let my head Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any Save to the God of heaven and to my king And sooner dance upon a bloody pole Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom True nobility is exempt from fear More can I bear than you dare execute Hale him away and let him talk no more Come soldiers show what cruelty ye can That this my death may never be forgot- Great men oft die by vile bezonians A Roman sworder and banditto slave Murder'd sweet Tully Brutus ' bastard hand Stabb'd Julius Caesar savage islanders Pompey the Great and Suffolk dies by pirates And as for these whose ransom we have set It is our pleasure one of them depart Therefore come you with us and let him go There let his head and lifeless body lie Until the Queen his mistress bury it Exit O barbarous and bloody spectacle His body will I bear unto the King If he revenge it not yet will his friends So will the Queen that living held him dear Come and get thee a sword though made of a lath they have been up these two days They have the more need to sleep now then I tell thee Jack Cade the clothier means to dress the commonwealth and turn it and set a new nap upon it So he had need for ' tis threadbare Well I say it was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up O miserable age Virtue is not regarded in handicraftsmen The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons Nay more the King 's Council are no good workmen True and yet it is said ' Labour in thy vocation ' which is as much to say as ' Let the magistrates be labouring men ' and therefore should we be magistrates Thou hast hit it for there 's no better sign of a brave mind than a hard hand I see them I see them There 's Best 's son the tanner of Wingham- He shall have the skins of our enemies to make dog 's leather of And Dick the butcher- Then is sin struck down like an ox and iniquity 's throat cut like a calf And Smith the weaver- Argo their thread of life is spun Come come let 's fall in with them We John Cade so term'd of our supposed father- Aside Or rather of stealing a cade of herrings For our enemies shall fall before us inspired with the spirit of putting down kings and princes- command silence Silence My father was a Mortimer- Aside He was an honest man and a good bricklayer My mother a Plantagenet- Aside I knew her well she was a midwife My wife descended of the Lacies- Aside She was indeed a pedlar 's daughter and sold many laces Aside But now of late not able to travel with her furr'd pack she washes bucks here at home Therefore am I of an honourable house Aside Ay by my faith the field is honourable and there was he born under a hedge for his father had never a house but the cage Valiant I am Aside ' A must needs for beggary is valiant I am able to endure much Aside No question of that for I have seen him whipt three market days together I fear neither sword nor fire Aside He need not fear the sword for his coat is of proof Aside But methinks he should stand in fear of fire being burnt i ' th ' hand for stealing of sheep Be brave then for your captain is brave and vows reformation There shall be in England seven halfpenny loaves sold for a penny the three hoop'd pot shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony to drink small beer All the realm shall be in common and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to grass And when I am king- as king I will be God save your Majesty I thank you good people- there shall be no money all shall eat and drink on my score and I will apparel them all in one livery that they may agree like brothers and worship me their lord The first thing we do let 's kill all the lawyers Nay that I mean to do Is not this a lamentable thing that of the skin of an innocent lamb should be made parchment That parchment being scribbl'd o'er should undo a man Some say the bee stings but I say ' tis the bee 's wax for I did but seal once to a thing and I was never mine own man since How now Who 's there The clerk of Chatham He can write and read and cast accompt O monstrous We took him setting of boys ' copies Here 's a villain Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't Nay then he is a conjurer Nay he can make obligations and write court hand I am sorry for't the man is a proper man of mine honour unless I find him guilty he shall not die Come hither sirrah I must examine thee What is thy name Emmanuel They use to write it on the top of letters ' twill go hard with you Let me alone Dost thou use to write thy name or hast thou a mark to thyself like a honest plain dealing man Sir I thank God I have been so well brought up that I can write my name He hath confess'd Away with him He 's a villain and a traitor Away with him I say Hang him with his pen and inkhorn about his neck Exit one with the CLERK Where 's our General Here I am thou particular fellow Fly fly fly Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother are hard by with the King 's forces Stand villain stand or I 'll fell thee down He shall be encount'red with a man as good as himself He is but a knight is ' a No To equal him I will make myself a knight presently Kneels Rise up Sir John Mortimer Rises Now have at him Rebellious hinds the filth and scum of Kent Mark'd for the gallows lay your weapons down Home to your cottages forsake this groom The King is merciful if you revolt But angry wrathful and inclin'd to blood If you go forward therefore yield or die As for these silken coated slaves I pass not It is to you good people that I speak O'er whom in time to come I hope to reign For I am rightful heir unto the crown Villain thy father was a plasterer And thou thyself a shearman art thou not And Adam was a gardener And what of that Marry this Edmund Mortimer Earl of March Married the Duke of Clarence ' daughter did he not Ay sir By her he had two children at one birth That 's false Ay there 's the question but I say ' tis true The elder of them being put to nurse Was by a beggar woman stol'n away And ignorant of his birth and parentage Became a bricklayer when he came to age His son am I deny it if you can Nay ' tis too true therefore he shall be king Sir he made a chimney in my father 's house and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it therefore deny it not And will you credit this base drudge 's words That speaks he knows not what Ay marry will we therefore get ye gone Jack Cade the Duke of York hath taught you this Aside He lies for I invented it myself- Go to sirrah tell the King from me that for his father 's sake Henry the Fifth in whose time boys went to span counter for French crowns I am content he shall reign but I 'll be Protector over him And furthermore we 'll have the Lord Say 's head for selling the dukedom of Maine And good reason for thereby is England main'd and fain to go with a staff but that my puissance holds it up Fellow kings I tell you that that Lord Say hath gelded the commonwealth and made it an eunuch and more than that he can speak French and therefore he is a traitor O gross and miserable ignorance Nay answer if you can the Frenchmen are our enemies Go to then I ask but this can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor or no No no and therefore we 'll have his head Well seeing gentle words will not prevail Assail them with the army of the King Herald away and throughout every town Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade That those which fly before the battle ends May even in their wives'and children 's sight Be hang'd up for example at their doors And you that be the King 's friends follow me And you that love the commons follow me Now show yourselves men ' tis for liberty We will not leave one lord one gentleman Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon For they are thrifty honest men and such As would- but that they dare not- take our parts They are all in order and march toward us But then are we in order when we are most out of order Come march forward Exeunt Where 's Dick the butcher of Ashford Here sir They fell before thee like sheep and oxen and thou behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own slaughter house therefore thus will I reward thee- the Lent shall be as long again as it is and thou shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking one I desire no more And to speak truth thou deserv'st no less Putting on SIR HUMPHREY 'S brigandine This monument of the victory will I bear and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse heels till I do come to London where we will have the mayor 's sword borne before us If we mean to thrive and do good break open the gaols and let out the prisoners Fear not that I warrant thee Come let 's march towards London Exeunt Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind And makes it fearful and degenerate Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep But who can cease to weep and look on this Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast But where 's the body that I should embrace What answer makes your Grace to the rebels ' supplication I 'll send some holy bishop to entreat For God forbid so many simple souls Should perish by the sword And I myself Rather than bloody war shall cut them short Will parley with Jack Cade their general But stay I 'll read it over once again Ah barbarous villains Hath this lovely face Rul'd like a wandering planet over me And could it not enforce them to relent That were unworthy to behold the same Lord Say Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head Ay but I hope your Highness shall have his How now madam Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk 's death I fear me love if that I had been dead Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me No my love I should not mourn but die for thee How now What news Why com'st thou in such haste The rebels are in Southwark fly my lord Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer Descended from the Duke of Clarence ' house And calls your Grace usurper openly And vows to crown himself in Westminster His army is a ragged multitude Of hinds and peasants rude and merciless Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother 's death Hath given them heart and courage to proceed All scholars lawyers courtiers gentlemen They call false caterpillars and intend their death O graceless men they know not what they do My gracious lord retire to Killingworth Until a power be rais'd to put them down Ah were the Duke of Suffolk now alive These Kentish rebels would be soon appeas'd Lord Say the traitors hate thee Therefore away with us to Killingworth So might your Grace 's person be in danger The sight of me is odious in their eyes And therefore in this city will I stay And live alone as secret as I may Jack Cade hath gotten London Bridge The citizens fly and forsake their houses The rascal people thirsting after prey Join with the traitor and they jointly swear To spoil the city and your royal court Then linger not my lord away take horse Come Margaret God our hope will succour us My hope is gone now Suffolk is deceas'd To LORD SAY Farewell my lord trust not the Kentish rebels Trust nobody for fear you be betray'd The trust I have is in mine innocence And therefore am I bold and resolute Exeunt How now Is Jack Cade slain No my lord nor likely to be slain for they have won the bridge killing all those that withstand them The Lord Mayor craves aid of your honour from the Tower to defend the city from the rebels Such aid as I can spare you shall command But I am troubled here with them myself The rebels have assay'd to win the Tower But get you to Smithfield and gather head And thither I will send you Matthew Goffe Fight for your King your country and your lives And so farewell for I must hence again Exeunt Now is Mortimer lord of this city And here sitting upon London Stone I charge and command that of the city 's cost the pissing conduit run nothing but claret wine this first year of our reign And now henceforward it shall be treason for any that calls me other than Lord Mortimer Jack Cade Jack Cade Knock him down there They kill him If this fellow be wise he 'll never call ye Jack Cade more I think he hath a very fair warning My lord there 's an army gathered together in Smithfield Come then let 's go fight with them But first go and set London Bridge on fire and if you can burn down the Tower too Come let 's away Exeunt So sirs Now go some and pull down the Savoy others to th ' Inns of Court down with them all I have a suit unto your lordship Be it a lordship thou shalt have it for that word Only that the laws of England may come out of your mouth Aside Mass ' twill be sore law then for he was thrust in the mouth with a spear and ' tis not whole yet Aside Nay John it will be stinking law for his breath stinks with eating toasted cheese I have thought upon it it shall be so Away burn all the records of the realm My mouth shall be the Parliament of England Aside Then we are like to have biting statutes unless his teeth be pull'd out And henceforward all things shall be in common My lord a prize a prize Here 's the Lord Say which sold the towns in France he that made us pay one and twenty fifteens and one shining to the pound the last subsidy Well he shall be beheaded for it ten times Ah thou say thou serge nay thou buckram lord Now art thou within point blank of our jurisdiction regal What canst thou answer to my Majesty for giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu the Dauphin of France Be it known unto thee by these presence even the presence of Lord Mortimer that I am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art Thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school and whereas before our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally thou hast caused printing to be us'd and contrary to the King his crown and dignity thou hast built a paper mill It will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb and such abominable words as no Christian ear can endure to hear Thou hast appointed justices of peace to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer Moreover thou hast put them in prison and because they could not read thou hast hang'd them when indeed only for that cause they have been most worthy to live Thou dost ride in a foot cloth dost thou not What of that Marry thou ought'st not to let thy horse wear a cloak when honester men than thou go in their hose and doublets And work in their shirt too as myself for example that am a butcher You men of Kent- What say you of Kent Nothing but this ' tis ' bona terra mala gens ' Away with him away with him He speaks Latin Hear me but speak and bear me where you will Kent in the Commentaries Caesar writ Is term'd the civil'st place of all this isle Sweet is the country because full of riches The people liberal valiant active wealthy Which makes me hope you are not void of pity I sold not Maine I lost not Normandy Yet to recover them would lose my life Justice with favour have I always done Pray'rs and tears have mov'd me gifts could never When have I aught exacted at your hands But to maintain the King the realm and you Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks Because my book preferr'd me to the King And seeing ignorance is the curse of God Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits You can not but forbear to murder me This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings For your behoof Tut when struck'st thou one blow in the field Great men have reaching hands Oft have I struck Those that I never saw and struck them dead O monstrous coward What to come behind folks These cheeks are pale for watching for your good Give him a box o ' th ' ear and that will make 'em red again Long sitting to determine poor men 's causes Hath made me full of sickness and diseases Ye shall have a hempen caudle then and the help of hatchet Why dost thou quiver man The palsy and not fear provokes me Nay he nods at us as who should say ' I 'll be even with you ' I 'll see if his head will stand steadier on a pole or no Take him away and behead him Tell me wherein have I offended most Have I affected wealth or honour Speak Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold Is my apparel sumptuous to behold Whom have I injur'd that ye seek my death These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts O let me live Aside I feel remorse in myself with his words but I 'll bridle it He shall die an it be but for pleading so well for his life.- Away with him He has a familiar under his tongue he speaks not o ' God 's name Go take him away I say and strike off his head presently and then break into his son in law 's house Sir James Cromer and strike off his head and bring them both upon two poles hither It shall be done Ah countrymen if when you make your pray'rs God should be so obdurate as yourselves How would it fare with your departed souls And therefore yet relent and save my life Away with him and do as I command ye Exeunt some with LORD SAY The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head on his shoulders unless he pay me tribute there shall not a maid be married but she shall pay to me her maidenhead ere they have it Men shall hold of me in capite and we charge and command that their wives be as free as heart can wish or tongue can tell My lord when shall we go to Cheapside and take up commodities upon our bills Marry presently O brave But is not this braver Let them kiss one another for they lov'd well when they were alive Now part them again lest they consult about the giving up of some more towns in France Soldiers defer the spoil of the city until night for with these borne before us instead of maces will we ride through the streets and at every corner have them kiss Away Exeunt Up Fish Street down Saint Magnus ' Corner Kill and knock down Throw them into Thames Sound a parley What noise is this I hear Dare any be so bold to sound retreat or parley when I command them kill Ay here they be that dare and will disturb thee And therefore yet relent and save my life Know Cade we come ambassadors from the King Unto the commons whom thou hast misled And here pronounce free pardon to them all That will forsake thee and go home in peace What say ye countrymen Will ye relent And yield to mercy whilst ' tis offer'd you Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths Who loves the King and will embrace his pardon Fling up his cap and say ' God save his Majesty ' Who hateth him and honours not his father Henry the Fifth that made all France to quake Shake he his weapon at us and pass by God save the King God save the King What Buckingham and Clifford are ye so brave And you base peasants do ye believe him Will you needs be hang'd with your about your necks Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates that you should leave me at the White Hart in Southwark I thought ye would never have given out these arms till you had recovered your ancient freedom But you are all recreants and dastards and delight to live in slavery to the nobility Let them break your backs with burdens take your houses over your heads ravish your wives and daughters before your faces For me I will make shift for one and so God 's curse light upon you all We 'll follow Cade we 'll follow Cade Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth That thus you do exclaim you 'll go with him Will he conduct you through the heart of France And make the meanest of you earls and dukes Alas he hath no home no place to fly to Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil Unless by robbing of your friends and us Were't not a shame that whilst you live at jar The fearful French whom you late vanquished Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you Methinks already in this civil broil I see them lording it in London streets Crying ' Villiago ' unto all they meet Better ten thousand base born Cades miscarry Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman 's mercy To France to France and get what you have lost Spare England for it is your native coast Henry hath money you are strong and manly God on our side doubt not of victory A Clifford a Clifford We 'll follow the King and Clifford Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this multitude The name of Henry the Fifth hales them to an hundred mischiefs and makes them leave me desolate I see them lay their heads together to surprise me My sword make way for me for here is no staying In despite of the devils and hell have through the very middest of you and heavens and honour be witness that no want of resolution in me but only my followers ' base and ignominious treasons makes me betake me to my heels What is he fled Go some and follow him And he that brings his head unto the King Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne And could command no more content than I No sooner was I crept out of my cradle But I was made a king at nine months old Was never subject long'd to be a King As I do long and wish to be a subject Health and glad tidings to your Majesty Why Buckingham is the traitor Cade surpris'd Or is he but retir'd to make him strong He is fled my lord and all his powers do yield And humbly thus with halters on their necks Expect your Highness ' doom of life or death Then heaven set ope thy everlasting gates To entertain my vows of thanks and praise Soldiers this day have you redeem'd your lives And show'd how well you love your Prince and country Continue still in this so good a mind And Henry though he be infortunate Assure yourselves will never be unkind And so with thanks and pardon to you all I do dismiss you to your several countries God save the King God save the King Please it your Grace to be advertised The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland And with a puissant and a mighty power Of gallowglasses and stout kerns Is marching hitherward in proud array And still proclaimeth as he comes along His arms are only to remove from thee The Duke of Somerset whom he terms a traitor Thus stands my state ' twixt Cade and York distress'd Like to a ship that having scap'd a tempest Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate But now is Cade driven back his men dispers'd And now is York in arms to second him I pray thee Buckingham go and meet him And ask him what 's the reason of these arms Tell him I 'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower- And Somerset we will commit thee thither Until his army be dismiss'd from him My lord I 'll yield myself to prison willingly Or unto death to do my country good In any case be not too rough in terms For he is fierce and can not brook hard language I will my lord and doubt not so to deal As all things shall redound unto your good Come wife let 's in and learn to govern better For yet may England curse my wretched reign Fie on ambitions Fie on myself that have a sword and yet am ready to famish These five days have I hid me in these woods and durst not peep out for all the country is laid for me but now am I so hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a thousand years I could stay no longer Wherefore on a brick wall have I climb'd into this garden to see if I can eat grass or pick a sallet another while which is not amiss to cool a man 's stomach this hot weather And I think this word ' sallet ' was born to do me good for many a time but for a sallet my brain pain had been cleft with a brown bill and many a time when I have been dry and bravely marching it hath serv'd me instead of a quart pot to drink in and now the word ' sallet ' must serve me to feed on Lord who would live turmoiled in the court And may enjoy such quiet walks as these This small inheritance my father left me Contenteth me and worth a monarchy I seek not to wax great by others ' waning Or gather wealth I care not with what envy Sufficeth that I have maintains my state And sends the poor well pleased from my gate Here 's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray for entering his fee simple without leave Ah villain thou wilt betray me and get a thousand crowns of the King by carrying my head to him but I 'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich and swallow my sword like a great pin ere thou and I part Why rude companion whatsoe'er thou be I know thee not why then should I betray thee Is't not enough to break into my garden And like a thief to come to rob my grounds Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms Brave thee Ay by the best blood that ever was broach'd and beard thee too Look on me well I have eat no meat these five days yet come thou and thy five men and if I do not leave you all as dead as a door nail I pray God I may never eat grass more Nay it shall ne'er be said while England stands That Alexander Iden an esquire of Kent Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man Oppose thy steadfast gazing eyes to mine See if thou canst outface me with thy looks Set limb to limb and thou art far the lesser Thy hand is but a finger to my fist Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast And if mine arm be heaved in the air Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth As for words whose greatness answers words Let this my sword report what speech forbears By my valour the most complete champion that ever I heard Steel if thou turn the edge or cut not out the burly bon'd clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath I beseech God on my knees thou mayst be turn'd to hobnails Here they fight CADE falls O I am slain famine and no other hath slain me Let ten thousand devils come against me and give me but the ten meals I have lost and I 'd defy them all Wither garden and be henceforth a burying place to all that do dwell in this house because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled Is't Cade that I have slain that monstrous traitor Sword I will hallow thee for this thy deed And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point But thou shalt wear it as a herald 's coat To emblaze the honour that thy master got Iden farewell and be proud of thy victory Tell Kent from me she hath lost her best man and exhort all the world to be cowards for I that never feared any am vanquished by famine not by valour Dies How much thou wrong'st me heaven be my judge Die damned wretch the curse of her that bare thee And as I thrust thy body in with my sword So wish I I might thrust thy soul to hell Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave And there cut off thy most ungracious head Which I will bear in triumph to the King Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon Exit From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right And pluck the crown from feeble Henry 's head Ring bells aloud burn bonfires clear and bright To entertain great England 's lawful king Ah sancta majestas who would not buy thee dear Let them obey that knows not how to rule This hand was made to handle nought but gold I can not give due action to my words Except a sword or sceptre balance it A sceptre shall it have have I a soul On which I 'll toss the flower de luce of France York if thou meanest well I greet thee well Humphrey of Buckingham I accept thy greeting Art thou a messenger or come of pleasure A messenger from Henry our dread liege To know the reason of these arms in peace Or why thou being a subject as I am Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn Should raise so great a power without his leave Or dare to bring thy force so near the court Aside Scarce can I speak my choler is so great O I could hew up rocks and fight with flint I am so angry at these abject terms And now like Ajax Telamonius On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury I am far better born than is the King More like a king more kingly in my thoughts But I must make fair weather yet awhile Till Henry be more weak and I more strong.- Buckingham I prithee pardon me That I have given no answer all this while My mind was troubled with deep melancholy The cause why I have brought this army hither Is to remove proud Somerset from the King Seditious to his Grace and to the state That is too much presumption on thy part But if thy arms be to no other end The King hath yielded unto thy demand The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower Upon thine honour is he prisoner Upon mine honour he is prisoner Then Buckingham I do dismiss my pow'rs Soldiers I thank you all disperse yourselves Meet me to morrow in Saint George 's field You shall have pay and everything you wish And let my sovereign virtuous Henry Command my eldest son nay all my sons As pledges of my fealty and love I 'll send them all as willing as I live Lands goods horse armour anything I have Is his to use so Somerset may die York I commend this kind submission We twain will go into his Highness ' tent Buckingham doth York intend no harm to us That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm In all submission and humility York doth present himself unto your Highness Then what intends these forces thou dost bring To heave the traitor Somerset from hence And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade Who since I heard to be discomfited If one so rude and of so mean condition May pass into the presence of a king Lo I present your Grace a traitor 's head The head of Cade whom I in combat slew The head of Cade Great God how just art Thou O let me view his visage being dead That living wrought me such exceeding trouble Tell me my friend art thou the man that slew him I was an't like your Majesty How art thou call'd And what is thy degree Alexander Iden that 's my name A poor esquire of Kent that loves his king So please it you my lord ' twere not amiss He were created knight for his good service Iden kneel down He kneels Rise up a knight We give thee for reward a thousand marks And will that thou thenceforth attend on us May Iden live to merit such a bounty And never live but true unto his liege See Buckingham Somerset comes with th ' Queen Go bid her hide him quickly from the Duke For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head But boldly stand and front him to his face How now Is Somerset at liberty Then York unloose thy long imprisoned thoughts And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart Shall I endure the sight of Somerset False king why hast thou broken faith with me Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse King did I call thee No thou art not king Not fit to govern and rule multitudes Which dar'st not no nor canst not rule a traitor That head of thine doth not become a crown Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer 's staff And not to grace an awful princely sceptre That gold must round engirt these brows of mine Whose smile and frown like to Achilles ' spear Is able with the change to kill and cure Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up And with the same to act controlling laws Give place By heaven thou shalt rule no more O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler O monstrous traitor I arrest thee York Of capital treason ' gainst the King and crown Obey audacious traitor kneel for grace Wouldst have me kneel First let me ask of these If they can brook I bow a knee to man Sirrah call in my sons to be my bail Exit attendant I know ere thy will have me go to ward They 'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement Call hither Clifford bid him come amain To say if that the bastard boys of York Shall be the surety for their traitor father O blood bespotted Neapolitan Outcast of Naples England 's bloody scourge The sons of York thy betters in their birth Shall be their father 's bail and bane to those That for my surety will refuse the boys And here comes Clifford to deny their bail Health and all happiness to my lord the King I thank thee Clifford Say what news with thee Nay do not fright us with an angry look We are thy sovereign Clifford kneel again For thy mistaking so we pardon thee This is my King York I do not mistake But thou mistakes me much to think I do To Bedlam with him Is the man grown mad Ay Clifford a bedlam and ambitious humour Makes him oppose himself against his king He is a traitor let him to the Tower And chop away that factious pate of his He is arrested but will not obey His sons he says shall give their words for him Will you not sons Ay noble father if our words will serve And if words will not then our weapons shall Why what a brood of traitors have we here Look in a glass and call thy image so I am thy king and thou a false heart traitor Call hither to the stake my two brave bears That with the very shaking of their chains They may astonish these fell lurking curs Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me Are these thy bears We 'll bait thy bears to death And manacle the berard in their chains If thou dar'st bring them to the baiting place Oft have I seen a hot o'er weening cur Run back and bite because he was withheld Who being suffer'd with the bear 's fell paw Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried And such a piece of service will you do If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick Hence heap of wrath foul indigested lump As crooked in thy manners as thy shape Nay we shall heat you thoroughly anon Take heed lest by your heat you burn yourselves Why Warwick hath thy knee forgot to bow Old Salisbury shame to thy silver hair Thou mad misleader of thy brainsick son What wilt thou on thy death bed play the ruffian And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles O where is faith O where is loyalty If it be banish'd from the frosty head Where shall it find a harbour in the earth Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war And shame thine honourable age with blood Why art thou old and want'st experience Or wherefore dost abuse it if thou hast it For shame In duty bend thy knee to me That bows unto the grave with mickle age My lord I have considered with myself The tide of this most renowned duke And in my conscience do repute his Grace The rightful heir to England 's royal seat Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me I have Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath It is great sin to swear unto a sin But greater sin to keep a sinful oath Who can be bound by any solemn vow To do a murd'rous deed to rob a man To force a spotless virgin 's chastity To reave the orphan of his patrimony To wring the widow from her custom'd right And have no other reason for this wrong But that he was bound by a solemn oath A subtle traitor needs no sophister Call Buckingham and bid him arm himself Call Buckingham and all the friends thou hast I am resolv'd for death or dignity The first I warrant thee if dreams prove true You were best to go to bed and dream again To keep thee from the tempest of the field I am resolv'd to bear a greater storm Than any thou canst conjure up to day And that I 'll write upon thy burgonet Might I but know thee by thy household badge Now by my father 's badge old Nevil 's crest The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff This day I 'll wear aloft my burgonet As on a mountain top the cedar shows That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm Even to affright thee with the view thereof And from thy burgonet I 'll rend thy bear And tread it under foot with all contempt Despite the berard that protects the bear And so to arms victorious father To quell the rebels and their complices Fie charity for shame Speak not in spite For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to night Foul stigmatic that 's more than thou canst tell If not in heaven you 'll surely sup in hell Clifford of Cumberland ' tis Warwick calls And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear Now when the angry trumpet sounds alarum And dead men 's cries do fill the empty air Clifford I say come forth and fight with me Proud northern lord Clifford of Cumberland The deadly handed Clifford slew my steed But match to match I have encount'red him And made a prey for carrion kites and crows Even of the bonny beast he lov'd so well Of one or both of us the time is come Hold Warwick seek thee out some other chase For I myself must hunt this deer to death Then nobly York ' tis for a crown thou fight'st As I intend Clifford to thrive to day It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd Exit What seest thou in me York Why dost thou pause With thy brave bearing should I be in love But that thou art so fast mine enemy Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem But that ' tis shown ignobly and in treason So let it help me now against thy sword As I in justice and true right express it My soul and body on the action both A dreadful lay Address thee instantly La fin couronne les oeuvres Dies Thus war hath given thee peace for thou art still Peace with his soul heaven if it be thy will Exit Shame and confusion All is on the rout Fear frames disorder and disorder wounds Where it should guard O war thou son of hell Whom angry heavens do make their minister Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part Hot coals of vengeance Let no soldier fly He that is truly dedicate to war Hath no self love nor he that loves himself Hath not essentially but by circumstance The name of valour Sees his father 's body O let the vile world end And the premised flames of the last day Knit earth and heaven together Now let the general trumpet blow his blast Particularities and petty sounds To cease Wast thou ordain'd dear father To lose thy youth in peace and to achieve The silver livery of advised age And in thy reverence and thy chair days thus To die in ruffian battle Even at this sight My heart is turn'd to stone and while ' tis mine It shall be stony York not our old men spares No more will I their babes Tears virginal Shall be to me even as the dew to fire And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax Henceforth I will not have to do with pity Meet I an infant of the house of York Into as many gobbets will I cut it As wild Medea young Absyrtus did In cruelty will I seek out my fame Come thou new ruin of old Clifford 's house As did Aeneas old Anchises bear So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders But then Aeneas bare a living load Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine So lie thou there For underneath an alehouse ' paltry sign The Castle in Saint Albans Somerset Hath made the wizard famous in his death Sword hold thy temper heart be wrathful still Priests pray for enemies but princes kill Exit Away my lord You are slow for shame away Can we outrun the heavens Good Margaret stay What are you made of You 'll nor fight nor fly Now is it manhood wisdom and defence To give the enemy way and to secure us By what we can which can no more but fly But that my heart 's on future mischief set I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly But fly you must uncurable discomfit Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts Away for your relief and we will live To see their day and them our fortune give Away my lord away Exeunt Of Salisbury who can report of him That winter lion who in rage forgets Aged contusions and all brush of time And like a gallant in the brow of youth Repairs him with occasion This happy day Is not itself nor have we won one foot If Salisbury be lost My noble father Three times to day I holp him to his horse Three times bestrid him thrice I led him off Persuaded him from any further act But still where danger was still there I met him And like rich hangings in a homely house So was his will in his old feeble body But noble as he is look where he comes Now by my sword well hast thou fought to day By th ' mass so did we all I thank you Richard God knows how long it is I have to live And it hath pleas'd Him that three times to day You have defended me from imminent death Well lords we have not got that which we have ' Tis not enough our foes are this time fled Being opposites of such repairing nature I know our safety is to follow them For as I hear the King is fled to London To call a present court of Parliament Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth What says Lord Warwick Shall we after them After them Nay before them if we can Now by my faith lords ' twas a glorious day Saint Albans ' battle won by famous York Shall be eterniz'd in all age to come Sound drum and trumpets and to London all And more such days as these to us befall Exeunt I wonder how the King escap'd our hands While we pursu'd the horsemen of the north He slily stole away and left his men Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat Cheer'd up the drooping army and himself Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford all abreast Charg'd our main battle 's front and breaking in Were by the swords of common soldiers slain Lord Stafford 's father Duke of Buckingham Is either slain or wounded dangerous I cleft his beaver with a downright blow That this is true father behold his blood And brother here 's the Earl of Wiltshire 's blood Whom I encount'red as the battles join'd Speak thou for me and tell them what I did Richard hath best deserv'd of all my sons But is your Grace dead my Lord of Somerset Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt Thus do I hope to shake King Henry 's head And so do I. Victorious Prince of York Before I see thee seated in that throne Which now the house of Lancaster usurps I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close This is the palace of the fearful King And this the regal seat Possess it York For this is thine and not King Henry 's heirs ' Assist me then sweet Warwick and I will For hither we have broken in by force We 'll all assist you he that flies shall die Thanks gentle Norfolk Stay by me my lords And soldiers stay and lodge by me this night And when the King comes offer him no violence Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce The Queen this day here holds her parliament But little thinks we shall be of her council By words or blows here let us win our right Arm'd as we are let 's stay within this house The bloody parliament shall this be call'd Unless Plantagenet Duke of York be King And bashful Henry depos'd whose cowardice Hath made us by words to our enemies Then leave me not my lords be resolute I mean to take possession of my right Neither the King nor he that loves him best The proudest he that holds up Lancaster Dares stir a wing if Warwick shake his bells I 'll plant Plantagenet root him up who dares Resolve thee Richard claim the English crown My lords look where the sturdy rebel sits Even in the chair of state Belike he means Back'd by the power of Warwick that false peer To aspire unto the crown and reign as king Earl of Northumberland he slew thy father And thine Lord Clifford and you both have vow'd revenge On him his sons his favourites and his friends If I be not heavens be reveng'd on me The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel What shall we suffer this Let 's pluck him down My heart for anger burns I can not brook it Be patient gentle Earl of Westmoreland Patience is for poltroons such as he He durst not sit there had your father liv'd My gracious lord here in the parliament Let us assail the family of York Well hast thou spoken cousin be it so Ah know you not the city favours them And they have troops of soldiers at their beck But when the Duke is slain they 'll quickly fly Far be the thought of this from Henry 's heart To make a shambles of the parliament house Cousin of Exeter frowns words and threats Shall be the war that Henry means to use Thou factious Duke of York descend my throne And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet I am thy sovereign I am thine For shame come down he made thee Duke of York ' Twas my inheritance as the earldom was Thy father was a traitor to the crown Exeter thou art a traitor to the crown In following this usurping Henry Whom should he follow but his natural king True Clifford and that 's Richard Duke of York And shall I stand and thou sit in my throne It must and shall be so content thyself Be Duke of Lancaster let him be King He is both King and Duke of Lancaster And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain And Warwick shall disprove it You forget That we are those which chas'd you from the field And slew your fathers and with colours spread March'd through the city to the palace gates Yes Warwick I remember it to my grief And by his soul thou and thy house shall rue it Plantagenet of thee and these thy sons Thy kinsmen and thy friends I 'll have more lives Than drops of blood were in my father 's veins Urge it no more lest that instead of words I send thee Warwick such a messenger As shall revenge his death before I stir Poor Clifford how I scorn his worthless threats Will you we show our title to the crown If not our swords shall plead it in the field What title hast thou traitor to the crown Thy father was as thou art Duke of York Thy grandfather Roger Mortimer Earl of March I am the son of Henry the Fifth Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop And seiz'd upon their towns and provinces Talk not of France sith thou hast lost it all The Lord Protector lost it and not I When I was crown'd I was but nine months old You are old enough now and yet methinks you lose Father tear the crown from the usurper 's head Sweet father do so set it on your head Good brother as thou lov'st and honourest arms Let 's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus Sound drums and trumpets and the King will fly Sons peace Peace thou and give King Henry leave to speak Plantagenet shall speak first Hear him lords And be you silent and attentive too For he that interrupts him shall not live Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne Wherein my grandsire and my father sat No first shall war unpeople this my realm Ay and their colours often borne in France And now in England to our heart 's great sorrow Shall be my winding sheet Why faint you lords My title 's good and better far than his Prove it Henry and thou shalt be King Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown ' Twas by rebellion against his king Aside I know not what to say my title 's weak.- Tell me may not a king adopt an heir What then An if he may then am I lawful King For Richard in the view of many lords Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth Whose heir my father was and I am his He rose against him being his sovereign And made him to resign his crown perforce Suppose my lords he did it unconstrain'd Think you ' twere prejudicial to his crown No for he could not so resign his crown But that the next heir should succeed and reign Art thou against us Duke of Exeter His is the right and therefore pardon me Why whisper you my lords and answer not My conscience tells me he is lawful King Aside All will revolt from me and turn to him Plantagenet for all the claim thou lay'st Think not that Henry shall be so depos'd Depos'd he shall be in despite of all Thou art deceiv'd ' Tis not thy southern power Of Essex Norfolk Suffolk nor of Kent Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud Can set the Duke up in despite of me King Henry be thy title right or wrong Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence May that ground gape and swallow me alive Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father O Clifford how thy words revive my heart Henry of Lancaster resign thy crown What mutter you or what conspire you lords Do right unto this princely Duke of York Or I will fill the house with armed men And over the chair of state where now he sits Write up his title with usurping blood My Lord of Warwick hear but one word Let me for this my life time reign as king Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou liv'st I am content Richard Plantagenet Enjoy the kingdom after my decease What wrong is this unto the Prince your son What good is this to England and himself Base fearful and despairing Henry How hast thou injur'd both thyself and or us I can not stay to hear these articles Nor I. Come cousin let us tell the Queen these news Farewell faint hearted and degenerate king In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides Be thou a prey unto the house of York And die in bands for this unmanly deed In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome Or live in peace abandon'd and despis'd Turn this way Henry and regard them not They seek revenge and therefore will not yield Ah Exeter Why should you sigh my lord Not for myself Lord Warwick but my son Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit But be it as it may To YORK I here entail The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever Conditionally that here thou take an oath To cease this civil war and whilst I live To honour me as thy king and sovereign And neither by treason nor hostility To seek to put me down and reign thyself This oath I willingly take and will perform Long live King Henry Plantagenet embrace him And long live thou and these thy forward sons Now York and Lancaster are reconcil'd Accurs'd be he that seeks to make them foes Farewell my gracious lord I 'll to my castle And I 'll keep London with my soldiers And I to Norfolk with my followers And I unto the sea from whence I came And I with grief and sorrow to the court Here comes the Queen whose looks bewray her anger I 'll steal away Exeter so will I. Nay go not from me I will follow thee Be patient gentle queen and I will stay Who can be patient in such extremes Ah wretched man Would I had died a maid And never seen thee never borne thee son Seeing thou hast prov'd so unnatural a father Hath he deserv'd to lose his birthright thus Hadst thou but lov'd him half so well as I Or felt that pain which I did for him once Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart blood there Rather than have made that savage duke thine heir And disinherited thine only son Father you can not disinherit me If you be King why should not I succeed Pardon me Margaret pardon me sweet son The Earl of Warwick and the Duke enforc'd me Enforc'd thee Art thou King and wilt be Stay gentle Margaret and hear me speak Thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone Gentle son Edward thou wilt stay with me Ay to be murder'd by his enemies When I return with victory from the field I 'll see your Grace till then I 'll follow her Come son away we may not linger thus Poor queen How love to me and to her son Hath made her break out into terms of rage Reveng'd may she be on that hateful Duke Whose haughty spirit winged with desire Will cost my crown and like an empty eagle Tire on the flesh of me and of my son The loss of those three lords torments my heart I 'll write unto them and entreat them fair Come cousin you shall be the messenger And I I hope shall reconcile them all Exeunt Brother though I be youngest give me leave No I can better play the orator But I have reasons strong and forcible Why how now sons and brother at a strife What is your quarrel How began it first No quarrel but a slight contention About what About that which concerns your Grace and us- The crown of England father which is yours Mine boy Not till King Henry be dead Your right depends not on his life or death Now you are heir therefore enjoy it now By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe It will outrun you father in the end I took an oath that he should quietly reign But for a kingdom any oath may be broken I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year No God forbid your Grace should be forsworn I shall be if I claim by open war I 'll prove the contrary if you 'll hear me speak Thou canst not son it is impossible An oath is of no moment being not took Before a true and lawful magistrate That hath authority over him that swears Henry had none but did usurp the place Then seeing ' twas he that made you to depose Your oath my lord is vain and frivolous Therefore to arms And father do but think How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown Within whose circuit is Elysium And all that poets feign of bliss and joy Why do we linger thus I can not rest Until the white rose that I wear be dy'd Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry 's heart Richard enough I will be King or die Brother thou shalt to London presently And whet on Warwick to this enterprise Thou Richard shalt to the Duke of Norfolk And tell him privily of our intent You Edward shall unto my Lord Cobham With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise In them I trust for they are soldiers Witty courteous liberal full of spirit While you are thus employ'd what resteth more But that I seek occasion how to rise And yet the King not privy to my drift Nor any of the house of Lancaster The Queen with all the northern earls and lords Intend here to besiege you in your castle She is hard by with twenty thousand men And therefore fortify your hold my lord Ay with my sword What think'st thou that we fear them Edward and Richard you shall stay with me My brother Montague shall post to London Let noble Warwick Cobham and the rest Whom we have left protectors of the King With pow'rful policy strengthen themselves And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths Brother I go I 'll win them fear it not And thus most humbly I do take my leave Exit Sir john and Sir Hugh Mortimer mine uncles You are come to Sandal in a happy hour The army of the Queen mean to besiege us She shall not need we 'll meet her in the field What with five thousand men Ay with five hundred father for a need A woman 's general what should we fear I hear their drums Let 's set our men in order And issue forth and bid them battle straight Five men to twenty Though the odds be great I doubt not uncle of our victory Many a battle have I won in France When as the enemy hath been ten to one Why should I not now have the like success Exeunt Ah whither shall I fly to scape their hands Ah tutor look where bloody Clifford comes Chaplain away Thy priesthood saves thy life As for the brat of this accursed duke Whose father slew my father he shall die And I my lord will bear him company Soldiers away with him Ah Clifford murder not this innocent child Lest thou be hated both of God and man How now is he dead already Or is it fear That makes him close his eyes I 'll open them So looks the pent up lion o'er the wretch That trembles under his devouring paws And so he walks insulting o'er his prey And so he comes to rend his limbs asunder Ah gentle Clifford kill me with thy sword And not with such a cruel threat'ning look Sweet Clifford hear me speak before I die I am too mean a subject for thy wrath Be thou reveng'd on men and let me live In vain thou speak'st poor boy my father 's blood Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter Then let my father 's blood open it again He is a man and Clifford cope with him Had I thy brethren here their lives and thine Were not revenge sufficient for me No if I digg'd up thy forefathers ' graves And hung their rotten coffins up in chains It could not slake mine ire nor ease my heart The sight of any of the house of York Is as a fury to torment my soul And till I root out their accursed line And leave not one alive I live in hell Therefore- O let me pray before I take my death To thee I pray sweet Clifford pity me Such pity as my rapier 's point affords I never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me Thy father hath But ' twas ere I was born Thou hast one son for his sake pity me Lest in revenge thereof sith God is just He be as miserably slain as I. Ah let me live in prison all my days And when I give occasion of offence Then let me die for now thou hast no cause No cause Thy father slew my father therefore die Stabs him Di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae Dies Plantagenet I come Plantagenet And this thy son 's blood cleaving to my blade Shall rust upon my weapon till thy blood Congeal'd with this do make me wipe off both Exit The army of the Queen hath got the field My uncles both are slain in rescuing me And all my followers to the eager foe Turn back and fly like ships before the wind Or lambs pursu'd by hunger starved wolves My sons- God knows what hath bechanced them But this I know- they have demean'd themselves Like men born to renown by life or death Three times did Richard make a lane to me And thrice cried ' Courage father fight it out ' And full as oft came Edward to my side With purple falchion painted to the hilt In blood of those that had encount'red him And when the hardiest warriors did retire Richard cried ' Charge and give no foot of ground ' And cried ' A crown or else a glorious tomb A sceptre or an earthly sepulchre ' With this we charg'd again but out alas We bodg'd again as I have seen a swan With bootless labour swim against the tide And spend her strength with over matching waves Yield to our mercy proud Plantagenet Ay to such mercy as his ruthless arm With downright payment show'd unto my father Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car And made an evening at the noontide prick My ashes as the phoenix may bring forth A bird that will revenge upon you all And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with Why come you not What multitudes and fear So cowards fight when they can fly no further So doves do peck the falcon 's piercing talons So desperate thieves all hopeless of their lives Breathe out invectives ' gainst the officers O Clifford but bethink thee once again And in thy thought o'errun my former time And if thou canst for blushing view this face And bite thy tongue that slanders him with cowardice Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this I will not bandy with thee word for word But buckler with thee blows twice two for one Hold valiant Clifford for a thousand causes I would prolong awhile the traitor 's life Wrath makes him deaf speak thou Northumberland Hold Clifford do not honour him so much To prick thy finger though to wound his heart What valour were it when a cur doth grin For one to thrust his hand between his teeth When he might spurn him with his foot away It is war 's prize to take all vantages And ten to one is no impeach of valour Ay ay so strives the woodcock with the gin So doth the cony struggle in the net So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty So true men yield with robbers so o'er match'd What would your Grace have done unto him now Brave warriors Clifford and Northumberland Come make him stand upon this molehill here That raught at mountains with outstretched arms Yet parted but the shadow with his hand What was it you that would be England 's king Was't you that revell'd in our parliament And made a preachment of your high descent Where are your mess of sons to back you now The wanton Edward and the lusty George And where 's that valiant crook back prodigy Dicky your boy that with his grumbling voice Was wo nt to cheer his dad in mutinies Or with the rest where is your darling Rutland Look York I stain'd this napkin with the blood That valiant Clifford with his rapier 's point Made issue from the bosom of the boy And if thine eyes can water for his death I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal Alas poor York but that I hate thee deadly I should lament thy miserable state I prithee grieve to make me merry York What hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails That not a tear can fall for Rutland 's death Why art thou patient man Thou shouldst be mad And I to make thee mad do mock thee thus Stamp rave and fret that I may sing and dance Thou wouldst be fee'd I see to make me sport York can not speak unless he wear a crown A crown for York!-and lords bow low to him Hold you his hands whilst I do set it on That is my office for my father 's sake Nay stay let 's hear the orisons he makes She wolf of France but worse than wolves of France Whose tongue more poisons than the adder 's tooth How ill beseeming is it in thy sex To triumph like an Amazonian trull Upon their woes whom fortune captivates But that thy face is visard like unchanging Made impudent with use of evil deeds I would assay proud queen to make thee blush To tell thee whence thou cam'st of whom deriv'd Were shame enough to shame thee wert thou not shameless Thy father bears the type of King of Naples Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult It needs not nor it boots thee not proud queen Unless the adage must be verified That beggars mounted run their horse to death ' Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud But God He knows thy share thereof is small ' Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd The contrary doth make thee wond'red at ' Tis government that makes them seem divine The want thereof makes thee abominable Thou art as opposite to every good As the Antipodes are unto us Or as the south to the septentrion O tiger 's heart wrapp'd in a woman 's hide How couldst thou drain the life blood of the child To bid the father wipe his eyes withal And yet be seen to bear a woman 's face Women are soft mild pitiful and flexible Thou stern obdurate flinty rough remorseless Bid'st thou me rage Why now thou hast thy wish Wouldst have me weep Why now thou hast thy will For raging wind blows up incessant showers And when the rage allays the rain begins These tears are my sweet Rutland 's obsequies And every drop cries vengeance for his death ' Gainst thee fell Clifford and thee false Frenchwoman Beshrew me but his passions move me so That hardly can I check my eyes from tears That face of his the hungry cannibals Would not have touch'd would not have stain'd with blood But you are more inhuman more inexorable- O ten times more- than tigers of Hyrcania See ruthless queen a hapless father 's tears This cloth thou dipp'dst in blood of my sweet boy And I with tears do wash the blood away Keep thou the napkin and go boast of this And if thou tell'st the heavy story right Upon my soul the hearers will shed tears Yea even my foes will shed fast falling tears And say ' Alas it was a piteous deed ' There take the crown and with the crown my curse And in thy need such comfort come to thee As now I reap at thy too cruel hand Hard hearted Clifford take me from the world My soul to heaven my blood upon your heads Had he been slaughter man to all my kin I should not for my life but weep with him To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul What weeping ripe my Lord Northumberland Think but upon the wrong he did us all And that will quickly dry thy melting tears Here 's for my oath here 's for my father 's death And here 's to right our gentle hearted king Open Thy gate of mercy gracious God My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee Off with his head and set it on York gates So York may overlook the town of York I wonder how our princely father scap'd Or whether he be scap'd away or no From Clifford 's and Northumberland 's pursuit Had he been ta'en we should have heard the news Had he been slain we should have heard the news Or had he scap'd methinks we should have heard The happy tidings of his good escape How fares my brother Why is he so sad I can not joy until I be resolv'd Where our right valiant father is become I saw him in the battle range about And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth Methought he bore him in the thickest troop As doth a lion in a herd of neat Or as a bear encompass'd round with dogs Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry The rest stand all aloof and bark at him So far'd our father with his enemies So fled his enemies my warlike father Methinks ' tis prize enough to be his son See how the morning opes her golden gates And takes her farewell of the glorious sun How well resembles it the prime of youth Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love Dazzle mine eyes or do I see three suns Three glorious suns each one a perfect sun Not separated with the racking clouds But sever'd in a pale clear shining sky See see they join embrace and seem to kiss As if they vow'd some league inviolable Now are they but one lamp one light one sun In this the heaven figures some event ' Tis wondrous strange the like yet never heard of I think it cites us brother to the field That we the sons of brave Plantagenet Each one already blazing by our meeds Should notwithstanding join our lights together And overshine the earth as this the world Whate'er it bodes henceforward will I bear Upon my target three fair shining suns Nay bear three daughters- by your leave I speak it You love the breeder better than the male Ah one that was a woeful looker on When as the noble Duke of York was slain Your princely father and my loving lord O speak no more for I have heard too much Say how he died for I will hear it all Environed he was with many foes And stood against them as the hope of Troy Against the Greeks that would have ent'red Troy But Hercules himself must yield to odds And many strokes though with a little axe Hews down and fells the hardest timber'd oak By many hands your father was subdu'd But only slaught'red by the ireful arm Of unrelenting Clifford and the Queen Who crown'd the gracious Duke in high despite Laugh'd in his face and when with grief he wept The ruthless Queen gave him to dry his cheeks A napkin steeped in the harmless blood Of sweet young Rutland by rough Clifford slain And after many scorns many foul taunts They took his head and on the gates of York They set the same and there it doth remain The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd Sweet Duke of York our prop to lean upon Now thou art gone we have no staff no stay O Clifford boist'rous Clifford thou hast slain The flow'r of Europe for his chivalry And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee Now my soul 's palace is become a prison Ah would she break from hence that this my body Might in the ground be closed up in rest For never henceforth shall I joy again Never O never shall I see more joy I can not weep for all my body 's moisture Scarce serves to quench my furnace burning heart Nor can my tongue unload my heart 's great burden For self same wind that I should speak withal Is kindling coals that fires all my breast And burns me up with flames that tears would quench To weep is to make less the depth of grief Tears then for babes blows and revenge for me Richard I bear thy name I 'll venge thy death Or die renowned by attempting it His name that valiant duke hath left with thee His dukedom and his chair with me is left Nay if thou be that princely eagle 's bird Show thy descent by gazing ' gainst the sun For chair and dukedom throne and kingdom say Either that is thine or else thou wert not his How now fair lords What fare What news abroad Great Lord of Warwick if we should recount Our baleful news and at each word 's deliverance Stab poinards in our flesh till all were told The words would add more anguish than the wounds O valiant lord the Duke of York is slain O Warwick Warwick that Plantagenet Which held thee dearly as his soul 's redemption Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears And now to add more measure to your woes I come to tell you things sith then befall'n After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought Where your brave father breath'd his latest gasp Tidings as swiftly as the posts could run Were brought me of your loss and his depart I then in London keeper of the King Muster'd my soldiers gathered flocks of friends And very well appointed as I thought March'd toward Saint Albans to intercept the Queen Bearing the King in my behalf along For by my scouts I was advertised That she was coming with a full intent To dash our late decree in parliament Touching King Henry 's oath and your succession Short tale to make- we at Saint Albans met Our battles join'd and both sides fiercely fought But whether ' twas the coldness of the King Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen Or whether ' twas report of her success Or more than common fear of Clifford 's rigour Who thunders to his captives blood and death I can not judge but to conclude with truth Their weapons like to lightning came and went Our soldiers ' like the night owl 's lazy flight Or like an idle thresher with a flail Fell gently down as if they struck their friends I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause With promise of high pay and great rewards But all in vain they had no heart to fight And we in them no hope to win the day So that we fled the King unto the Queen Lord George your brother Norfolk and myself In haste post haste are come to join with you For in the marches here we heard you were Making another head to fight again Where is the Duke of Norfolk gentle Warwick And when came George from Burgundy to England Some six miles off the Duke is with the soldiers And for your brother he was lately sent From your kind aunt Duchess of Burgundy With aid of soldiers to this needful war ' Twas odds belike when valiant Warwick fled Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit But ne'er till now his scandal of retire Nor now my scandal Richard dost thou hear For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry 's head And wring the awful sceptre from his fist Were he as famous and as bold in war As he is fam'd for mildness peace and prayer I know it well Lord Warwick blame me not ' Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak But in this troublous time what 's to be done Shall we go throw away our coats of steel And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns Numbering our Ave Maries with our beads Or shall we on the helmets of our foes Tell our devotion with revengeful arms If for the last say ' Ay ' and to it lords Why therefore Warwick came to seek you out And therefore comes my brother Montague Attend me lords The proud insulting Queen With Clifford and the haught Northumberland And of their feather many moe proud birds Have wrought the easy melting King like wax He swore consent to your succession His oath enrolled in the parliament And now to London all the crew are gone To frustrate both his oath and what beside May make against the house of Lancaster Their power I think is thirty thousand strong Now if the help of Norfolk and myself With all the friends that thou brave Earl of March Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure Will but amount to five and twenty thousand Why Via to London will we march amain And once again bestride our foaming steeds And once again cry ' Charge upon our foes ' But never once again turn back and fly Ay now methinks I hear great Warwick speak Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day That cries ' Retire ' if Warwick bid him stay Lord Warwick on thy shoulder will I lean And when thou fail'st- as God forbid the hour!- Must Edward fall which peril heaven forfend No longer Earl of March but Duke of York The next degree is England 's royal throne For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd In every borough as we pass along And he that throws not up his cap for joy Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head King Edward valiant Richard Montague Stay we no longer dreaming of renown But sound the trumpets and about our task Then Clifford were thy heart as hard as steel As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds I come to pierce it or to give thee mine Then strike up drums God and Saint George for us How now what news The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me The Queen is coming with a puissant host And craves your company for speedy counsel Why then it sorts brave warriors let 's away Welcome my lord to this brave town of York Yonder 's the head of that arch enemy That sought to be encompass'd with your crown Doth not the object cheer your heart my lord Ay as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck- To see this sight it irks my very soul Withhold revenge dear God ' tis not my fault Nor wittingly have I infring'd my vow My gracious liege this too much lenity And harmful pity must be laid aside To whom do lions cast their gentle looks Not to the beast that would usurp their den Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick Not his that spoils her young before her face Who scapes the lurking serpent 's mortal sting Not he that sets his foot upon her back The smallest worm will turn being trodden on And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood Ambitious York did level at thy crown Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows He but a Duke would have his son a king And raise his issue like a loving sire Thou being a king bless'd with a goodly son Didst yield consent to disinherit him Which argued thee a most unloving father Unreasonable creatures feed their young And though man 's face be fearful to their eyes Yet in protection of their tender ones Who hath not seen them- even with those wings Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight- Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest Offering their own lives in their young 's defence For shame my liege make them your precedent Were it not pity that this goodly boy Should lose his birthright by his father 's fault And long hereafter say unto his child ' What my great grandfather and grandsire got My careless father fondly gave away ' Ah what a shame were this Look on the boy And let his manly face which promiseth Successful fortune steel thy melting heart To hold thine own and leave thine own with him Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator Inferring arguments of mighty force But Clifford tell me didst thou never hear That things ill got had ever bad success And happy always was it for that son Whose father for his hoarding went to hell I 'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind And would my father had left me no more For all the rest is held at such a rate As brings a thousand fold more care to keep Than in possession any jot of pleasure Ah cousin York would thy best friends did know How it doth grieve me that thy head is here My lord cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh And this soft courage makes your followers faint You promis'd knighthood to our forward son Unsheathe your sword and dub him presently Edward kneel down Edward Plantagenet arise a knight And learn this lesson Draw thy sword in right My gracious father by your kingly leave I 'll draw it as apparent to the crown And in that quarrel use it to the death Why that is spoken like a toward prince Royal commanders be in readiness For with a band of thirty thousand men Comes Warwick backing of the Duke of York And in the towns as they do march along Proclaims him king and many fly to him Darraign your battle for they are at hand I would your Highness would depart the field The Queen hath best success when you are absent Ay good my lord and leave us to our fortune Why that 's my fortune too therefore I 'll stay Be it with resolution then to fight My royal father cheer these noble lords And hearten those that fight in your defence Unsheathe your sword good father cry ' Saint George ' Now perjur'd Henry wilt thou kneel for grace And set thy diadem upon my head Or bide the mortal fortune of the field Go rate thy minions proud insulting boy Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king I am his king and he should bow his knee I was adopted heir by his consent Since when his oath is broke for as I hear You that are King though he do wear the crown Have caus'd him by new act of parliament To blot out me and put his own son in And reason too Who should succeed the father but the son Are you there butcher O I can not speak Ay crook back here I stand to answer thee Or any he the proudest of thy sort ' Twas you that kill'd young Rutland was it not Ay and old York and yet not satisfied For God 's sake lords give signal to the fight What say'st thou Henry Wilt thou yield the crown Why how now long tongu'd Warwick Dare you speak When you and I met at Saint Albans last Your legs did better service than your hands Then ' twas my turn to fly and now ' tis thine You said so much before and yet you fled ' Twas not your valour Clifford drove me thence No nor your manhood that durst make you stay Northumberland I hold thee reverently Break off the parley for scarce I can refrain The execution of my big swol'n heart Upon that Clifford that cruel child killer I slew thy father call'st thou him a child Ay like a dastard and a treacherous coward As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland But ere sunset I 'll make thee curse the deed Have done with words my lords and hear me speak Defy them then or else hold close thy lips I prithee give no limits to my tongue I am a king and privileg'd to speak My liege the wound that bred this meeting here Can not be cur'd by words therefore be still Then executioner unsheathe thy sword By Him that made us all I am resolv'd That Clifford 's manhood lies upon his tongue Say Henry shall I have my right or no A thousand men have broke their fasts to day That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown If thou deny their blood upon thy head For York in justice puts his armour on If that be right which Warwick says is right There is no wrong but every thing is right Whoever got thee there thy mother stands For well I wot thou hast thy mother 's tongue But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam But like a foul misshapen stigmatic Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided As venom toads or lizards ' dreadful stings Iron of Naples hid with English gilt Whose father bears the title of a king- As if a channel should be call'd the sea- Sham'st thou not knowing whence thou art extraught To let thy tongue detect thy base born heart A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns To make this shameless callet know herself Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou Although thy husband may be Menelaus And ne'er was Agamemmon 's brother wrong'd By that false woman as this king by thee His father revell'd in the heart of France And tam'd the King and made the Dauphin stoop And had he match'd according to his state He might have kept that glory to this day But when he took a beggar to his bed And grac'd thy poor sire with his bridal day Even then that sunshine brew'd a show'r for him That wash'd his father 's fortunes forth of France And heap'd sedition on his crown at home For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride Hadst thou been meek our title still had slept And we in pity of the gentle King Had slipp'd our claim until another age But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring And that thy summer bred us no increase We set the axe to thy usurping root And though the edge hath something hit ourselves Yet know thou since we have begun to strike We 'll never leave till we have hewn thee down Or bath'd thy growing with our heated bloods And in this resolution I defy thee Not willing any longer conference Since thou deniest the gentle King to speak Sound trumpets let our bloody colours wave And either victory or else a grave Stay Edward No wrangling woman we 'll no longer stay These words will cost ten thousand lives this day Forspent with toil as runners with a race I lay me down a little while to breathe For strokes receiv'd and many blows repaid Have robb'd my strong knit sinews of their strength And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile Smile gentle heaven or strike ungentle death For this world frowns and Edward 's sun is clouded How now my lord What hap What hope of good Our hap is lost our hope but sad despair Our ranks are broke and ruin follows us What counsel give you Whither shall we fly Bootless is flight they follow us with wings And weak we are and can not shun pursuit Ah Warwick why hast thou withdrawn thyself Thy brother 's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford 's lance And in the very pangs of death he cried Like to a dismal clangor heard from far ' Warwick revenge Brother revenge my death ' So underneath the belly of their steeds That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood The noble gentleman gave up the ghost Then let the earth be drunken with our blood I 'll kill my horse because I will not fly Why stand we like soft hearted women here Wailing our losses whiles the foe doth rage And look upon as if the tragedy Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors Here on my knee I vow to God above I 'll never pause again never stand still Till either death hath clos'd these eyes of mine Or fortune given me measure of revenge O Warwick I do bend my knee with thine And in this vow do chain my soul to thine And ere my knee rise from the earth 's cold face I throw my hands mine eyes my heart to Thee Thou setter up and plucker down of kings Beseeching Thee if with Thy will it stands That to my foes this body must be prey Yet that Thy brazen gates of heaven may ope And give sweet passage to my sinful soul Now lords take leave until we meet again Where'er it be in heaven or in earth Brother give me thy hand and gentle Warwick Let me embrace thee in my weary arms I that did never weep now melt with woe That winter should cut off our spring time so Away away Once more sweet lords farewell Yet let us all together to our troops And give them leave to fly that will not stay And call them pillars that will stand to us And if we thrive promise them such rewards As victors wear at the Olympian games This may plant courage in their quailing breasts For yet is hope of life and victory Forslow no longer make we hence amain Exeunt Now Clifford I have singled thee alone Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York And this for Rutland both bound to revenge Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall Now Richard I am with thee here alone This is the hand that stabbed thy father York And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland And here 's the heart that triumphs in their death And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother To execute the like upon thyself And so have at thee They fight Nay Warwick single out some other chase For I myself will hunt this wolf to death Exeunt This battle fares like to the morning 's war When dying clouds contend with growing light What time the shepherd blowing of his nails Can neither call it perfect day nor night Now sways it this way like a mighty sea Forc'd by the tide to combat with the wind Now sways it that way like the selfsame sea Forc'd to retire by fury of the wind Sometime the flood prevails and then the wind Now one the better then another best Both tugging to be victors breast to breast Yet neither conqueror nor conquered So is the equal poise of this fell war Here on this molehill will I sit me down To whom God will there be the victory For Margaret my queen and Clifford too Have chid me from the battle swearing both They prosper best of all when I am thence Would I were dead if God 's good will were so For what is in this world but grief and woe O God methinks it were a happy life To be no better than a homely swain To sit upon a hill as I do now To carve out dials quaintly point by point Thereby to see the minutes how they run- How many makes the hour full complete How many hours brings about the day How many days will finish up the year How many years a mortal man may live When this is known then to divide the times- So many hours must I tend my flock So many hours must I take my rest So many hours must I contemplate So many hours must I sport myself So many days my ewes have been with young So many weeks ere the poor fools will can So many years ere I shall shear the fleece So minutes hours days months and years Pass'd over to the end they were created Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave Ah what a life were this how sweet how lovely Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade To shepherds looking on their silly sheep Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy To kings that fear their subjects ' treachery O yes it doth a thousand fold it doth And to conclude the shepherd 's homely curds His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle His wonted sleep under a fresh tree 's shade All which secure and sweetly he enjoys Is far beyond a prince 's delicates- His viands sparkling in a golden cup His body couched in a curious bed When care mistrust and treason waits on him Ill blows the wind that profits nobody This man whom hand to hand I slew in fight May be possessed with some store of crowns And I that haply take them from him now May yet ere night yield both my life and them To some man else as this dead man doth me Who 's this O God It is my father 's face Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd O heavy times begetting such events From London by the King was I press'd forth My father being the Earl of Warwick 's man Came on the part of York press'd by his master And I who at his hands receiv'd my life Have by my hands of life bereaved him Pardon me God I knew not what I did And pardon father for I knew not thee My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks And no more words till they have flow'd their fill O piteous spectacle O bloody times Whiles lions war and battle for their dens Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity Weep wretched man I 'll aid thee tear for tear And let our hearts and eyes like civil war Be blind with tears and break o'ercharg'd with grief Thou that so stoutly hath resisted me Give me thy gold if thou hast any gold For I have bought it with an hundred blows But let me see Is this our foeman 's face Ah no no no no it is mine only son Ah boy if any life be left in thee Throw up thine eye See see what show'rs arise Blown with the windy tempest of my heart Upon thy wounds that kills mine eye and heart O pity God this miserable age What stratagems how fell how butcherly Erroneous mutinous and unnatural This deadly quarrel daily doth beget O boy thy father gave thee life too soon And hath bereft thee of thy life too late Woe above woe grief more than common grief O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds O pity pity gentle heaven pity The red rose and the white are on his face The fatal colours of our striving houses The one his purple blood right well resembles The other his pale cheeks methinks presenteth Wither one rose and let the other flourish If you contend a thousand lives must perish How will my mother for a father 's death Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied How will my wife for slaughter of my son Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied How will the country for these woeful chances Misthink the King and not be satisfied Was ever son so rued a father 's death Was ever father so bemoan'd his son Was ever king so griev'd for subjects ' woe Much is your sorrow mine ten times so much I 'll bear thee hence where I may weep my fill These arms of mine shall be thy winding sheet My heart sweet boy shall be thy sepulchre For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell And so obsequious will thy father be Even for the loss of thee having no more As Priam was for all his valiant sons I 'll bear thee hence and let them fight that will For I have murdered where I should not kill Sad hearted men much overgone with care Here sits a king more woeful than you are Fly father fly for all your friends are fled And Warwick rages like a chafed bull Away for death doth hold us in pursuit Mount you my lord towards Berwick post amain Edward and Richard like a brace of greyhounds Having the fearful flying hare in sight With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands Are at our backs and therefore hence amain Away for vengeance comes along with them Nay stay not to expostulate make speed Or else come after I 'll away before Nay take me with thee good sweet Exeter Not that I fear to stay but love to go Whither the Queen intends Forward away Exeunt Here burns my candle out ay here it dies Which whiles it lasted gave King Henry light O Lancaster I fear thy overthrow More than my body 's parting with my soul My love and fear glu'd many friends to thee And now I fall thy tough commixture melts Impairing Henry strength'ning misproud York The common people swarm like summer flies And whither fly the gnats but to the sun And who shines now but Henry 's enemies O Phoebus hadst thou never given consent That Phaethon should check thy fiery steeds Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth And Henry hadst thou sway'd as kings should do Or as thy father and his father did Giving no ground unto the house of York They never then had sprung like summer flies I and ten thousand in this luckless realm Had left no mourning widows for our death And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity Bootless are plaints and cureless are my wounds No way to fly nor strength to hold out flight The foe is merciless and will not pity For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity The air hath got into my deadly wounds And much effuse of blood doth make me faint Come York and Richard Warwick and the rest I stabb'd your fathers ' bosoms split my breast Now breathe we lords Good fortune bids us pause And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks Some troops pursue the bloody minded Queen That led calm Henry though he were a king As doth a sail fill'd with a fretting gust Command an argosy to stern the waves But think you lords that Clifford fled with them No ' tis impossible he should escape For though before his face I speak the words Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave And whereso'er he is he 's surely dead Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave A deadly groan like life and death 's departing See who it is And now the battle 's ended If friend or foe let him be gently used Revoke that doom of mercy for ' tis Clifford Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth But set his murd'ring knife unto the root From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring- I mean our princely father Duke of York From off the gates of York fetch down the head Your father 's head which Clifford placed there Instead whereof let this supply the room Measure for measure must be answered Bring forth that fatal screech owl to our house That nothing sung but death to us and ours Now death shall stop his dismal threat'ning sound And his ill boding tongue no more shall speak I think his understanding is bereft Speak Clifford dost thou know who speaks to thee Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life And he nor sees nor hears us what we say O would he did and so perhaps he doth ' Tis but his policy to counterfeit Because he would avoid such bitter taunts Which in the time of death he gave our father If so thou think'st vex him with eager words Clifford ask mercy and obtain no grace Clifford repent in bootless penitence Clifford devise excuses for thy faults While we devise fell tortures for thy faults Thou didst love York and I am son to York Thou pitied'st Rutland I will pity thee Where 's Captain Margaret to fence you now They mock thee Clifford swear as thou wast wo nt What not an oath Nay then the world goes hard When Clifford can not spare his friends an oath I know by that he 's dead and by my soul If this right hand would buy two hours ' life That I in all despite might rail at him This hand should chop it off and with the issuing blood Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst York and young Rutland could not satisfy Ay but he 's dead Off with the traitor 's head And rear it in the place your father 's stands And now to London with triumphant march There to be crowned England 's royal King From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen So shalt thou sinew both these lands together And having France thy friend thou shalt not dread The scatt'red foe that hopes to rise again For though they can not greatly sting to hurt Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears First will I see the coronation And then to Brittany I 'll cross the sea To effect this marriage so it please my lord Even as thou wilt sweet Warwick let it be For in thy shoulder do I build my seat And never will I undertake the thing Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting Richard I will create thee Duke of Gloucester And George of Clarence Warwick as ourself Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best Let me be Duke of Clarence George of Gloucester For Gloucester 's dukedom is too ominous Tut that 's a foolish observation Richard be Duke of Gloucester Now to London To see these honours in possession Exeunt Under this thick grown brake we 'll shroud ourselves For through this laund anon the deer will come And in this covert will we make our stand Culling the principal of all the deer I 'll stay above the hill so both may shoot That can not be the noise of thy cross bow Will scare the herd and so my shoot is lost Here stand we both and aim we at the best And for the time shall not seem tedious I 'll tell thee what befell me on a day In this self place where now we mean to stand Here comes a man let 's stay till he be past From Scotland am I stol'n even of pure love To greet mine own land with my wishful sight No Harry Harry ' tis no land of thine Thy place is fill'd thy sceptre wrung from thee Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed No bending knee will call thee Caesar now No humble suitors press to speak for right No not a man comes for redress of thee For how can I help them and not myself Ay here 's a deer whose skin 's a keeper 's fee This is the quondam King let 's seize upon him Let me embrace thee sour adversity For wise men say it is the wisest course Why linger we let us lay hands upon him Forbear awhile we 'll hear a little more My Queen and son are gone to France for aid And as I hear the great commanding Warwick Is thither gone to crave the French King 's sister To wife for Edward If this news be true Poor queen and son your labour is but lost For Warwick is a subtle orator And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words By this account then Margaret may win him For she 's a woman to be pitied much Her sighs will make a batt'ry in his breast Her tears will pierce into a marble heart The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn And Nero will be tainted with remorse To hear and see her plaints her brinish tears Ay but she 's come to beg Warwick to give She on his left side craving aid for Henry He on his right asking a wife for Edward She weeps and says her Henry is depos'd He smiles and says his Edward is install'd That she poor wretch for grief can speak no more Whiles Warwick tells his title smooths the wrong Inferreth arguments of mighty strength And in conclusion wins the King from her With promise of his sister and what else To strengthen and support King Edward 's place O Margaret thus ' twill be and thou poor soul Art then forsaken as thou went'st forlorn Say what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens More than I seem and less than I was born to A man at least for less I should not be And men may talk of kings and why not I Ay but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king Why so I am- in mind and that 's enough But if thou be a king where is thy crown My crown is in my heart not on my head Not deck'd with diamonds and Indian stones Not to be seen My crown is call'd content A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy Well if you be a king crown'd with content Your crown content and you must be contented To go along with us for as we think You are the king King Edward hath depos'd And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance Will apprehend you as his enemy But did you never swear and break an oath No never such an oath nor will not now Where did you dwell when I was King of England Here in this country where we now remain I was anointed king at nine months old My father and my grandfather were kings And you were sworn true subjects unto me And tell me then have you not broke your oaths No For we were subjects but while you were king Why am I dead Do I not breathe a man Ah simple men you know not what you swear Look as I blow this feather from my face And as the air blows it to me again Obeying with my wind when I do blow And yielding to another when it blows Commanded always by the greater gust Such is the lightness of you common men But do not break your oaths for of that sin My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty Go where you will the King shall be commanded And be you kings command and I 'll obey We are true subjects to the King King Edward So would you be again to Henry If he were seated as King Edward is We charge you in God 's name and the King 's To go with us unto the officers In God 's name lead your King 's name be obey'd And what God will that let your King perform And what he will I humbly yield unto Exeunt Brother of Gloucester at Saint Albans ' field This lady 's husband Sir Richard Grey was slain His land then seiz'd on by the conqueror Her suit is now to repossess those lands Which we in justice can not well deny Because in quarrel of the house of York The worthy gentleman did lose his life Your Highness shall do well to grant her suit It were dishonour to deny it her It were no less but yet I 'll make a pause Aside to CLARENCE Yea is it so I see the lady hath a thing to grant Before the King will grant her humble suit Aside to GLOUCESTER He knows the game how true he keeps the wind Aside to CLARENCE Silence Widow we will consider of your suit And come some other time to know our mind Right gracious lord I can not brook delay May it please your Highness to resolve me now And what your pleasure is shall satisfy me Aside Ay widow Then I 'll warrant you all your Aside to GLOUCESTER I fear her not unless she chance to fall Aside to CLARENCE God forbid that for he 'll take vantages How many children hast thou widow tell me Aside to GLOUCESTER I think he means to beg a child of her Aside to CLARENCE Nay then whip me he 'll rather give her two Three my most gracious lord Aside You shall have four if you 'll be rul'd by him ' Twere pity they should lose their father 's lands Be pitiful dread lord and grant it then Lords give us leave I 'll try this widow 's wit Aside Ay good leave have you for you will have Now tell me madam do you love your children Ay full as dearly as I love myself And would you not do much to do them good To do them good I would sustain some harm Then get your husband 's lands to do them good Therefore I came unto your Majesty I 'll tell you how these lands are to be got So shall you bind me to your Highness ' service What service wilt thou do me if I give them What you command that rests in me to do But you will take exceptions to my boon No gracious lord except I can not do it Ay but thou canst do what I mean to ask Why then I will do what your Grace commands He plies her hard and much rain wears the marble As red as fire Nay then her wax must melt Why stops my lord Shall I not hear my task An easy task ' tis but to love a king That 's soon perform'd because I am a subject Why then thy husband 's lands I freely give thee I take my leave with many thousand thanks The match is made she seals it with a curtsy But stay thee- ' tis the fruits of love I mean The fruits of love I mean my loving liege Ay but I fear me in another sense What love thinkst thou I sue so much to get My love till death my humble thanks my prayers That love which virtue begs and virtue grants No by my troth I did not mean such love Why then you mean not as I thought you did But now you partly may perceive my mind My mind will never grant what I perceive Your Highness aims at if I aim aright To tell thee plain I aim to lie with thee To tell you plain I had rather lie in prison Why then thou shalt not have thy husband 's lands Why then mine honesty shall be my dower For by that loss I will not purchase them Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily Herein your Highness wrongs both them and me But mighty lord this merry inclination Accords not with the sadness of my suit Please you dismiss me either with ay or no Ay if thou wilt say ay to my request No if thou dost say no to my demand Then no my lord My suit is at an end The widow likes him not she knits her brows He is the bluntest wooer in Christendom Aside Her looks doth argue her replete with modesty Her words doth show her wit incomparable All her perfections challenge sovereignty One way or other she is for a king And she shall be my love or else my queen Say that King Edward take thee for his queen ' Tis better said than done my gracious lord I am a subject fit to jest withal But far unfit to be a sovereign Sweet widow by my state I swear to thee I speak no more than what my soul intends And that is to enjoy thee for my love And that is more than I will yield unto I know I am too mean to be your queen And yet too good to be your concubine You cavil widow I did mean my queen ' Twill grieve your Grace my sons should call you father No more than when my daughters call thee mother Thou art a widow and thou hast some children And by God 's Mother I being but a bachelor Have other some Why ' tis a happy thing To be the father unto many sons Answer no more for thou shalt be my queen The ghostly father now hath done his shrift When he was made a shriver ' twas for shrift Brothers you muse what chat we two have had The widow likes it not for she looks very sad You 'd think it strange if I should marry her To who my lord Why Clarence to myself That would be ten days ' wonder at the least That 's a day longer than a wonder lasts By so much is the wonder in extremes Well jest on brothers I can tell you both Her suit is granted for her husband 's lands My gracious lord Henry your foe is taken And brought your prisoner to your palace gate See that he be convey'd unto the Tower And go we brothers to the man that took him To question of his apprehension Widow go you along Lords use her honourably Ay Edward will use women honourably Would he were wasted marrow bones and all That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring To cross me from the golden time I look for And yet between my soul 's desire and me- The lustful Edward 's title buried- Is Clarence Henry and his son young Edward And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies To take their rooms ere I can place myself A cold premeditation for my purpose Why then I do but dream on sovereignty Like one that stands upon a promontory And spies a far off shore where he would tread Wishing his foot were equal with his eye And chides the sea that sunders him from thence Saying he 'll lade it dry to have his way- So do I wish the crown being so far off And so I chide the means that keeps me from it And so I say I 'll cut the causes off Flattering me with impossibilities My eye 's too quick my heart o'erweens too much Unless my hand and strength could equal them Well say there is no kingdom then for Richard What other pleasure can the world afford I 'll make my heaven in a lady 's lap And deck my body in gay ornaments And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks O miserable thought and more unlikely Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns Why love forswore me in my mother 's womb And for I should not deal in her soft laws She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub To make an envious mountain on my back Where sits deformity to mock my body To shape my legs of an unequal size To disproportion me in every part Like to a chaos or an unlick'd bear whelp That carries no impression like the dam And am I then a man to be belov'd O monstrous fault to harbour such a thought Then since this earth affords no joy to me But to command to check to o'erbear such As are of better person than myself I 'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown And whiles I live t ' account this world but hell Until my misshap'd trunk that bear this head Be round impaled with a glorious crown And yet I know not how to get the crown For many lives stand between me and home And I- like one lost in a thorny wood That rents the thorns and is rent with the thorns Seeking a way and straying from the way Not knowing how to find the open air But toiling desperately to find it out- Torment myself to catch the English crown And from that torment I will free myself Or hew my way out with a bloody axe Why I can smile and murder whiles I smile And cry ' Content ' to that which grieves my heart And wet my cheeks with artificial tears And frame my face to all occasions I 'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall I 'll slay more gazers than the basilisk I 'll play the orator as well as Nestor Deceive more slily than Ulysses could And like a Sinon take another Troy I can add colours to the chameleon Change shapes with Protheus for advantages And set the murderous Machiavel to school Can I do this and can not get a crown Tut were it farther off I 'll pluck it down Exit Fair Queen of England worthy Margaret Sit down with us It ill befits thy state And birth that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit No mighty King of France Now Margaret Must strike her sail and learn a while to serve Where kings command I was I must confess Great Albion 's Queen in former golden days But now mischance hath trod my title down And with dishonour laid me on the ground Where I must take like seat unto my fortune And to my humble seat conform myself Why say fair Queen whence springs this deep despair From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears And stops my tongue while heart is drown'd in cares Whate'er it be be thou still like thyself And sit thee by our side Seats her by him Yield not thy neck To fortune 's yoke but let thy dauntless mind Still ride in triumph over all mischance Be plain Queen Margaret and tell thy grief It shall be eas'd if France can yield relief Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts And give my tongue tied sorrows leave to speak Now therefore be it known to noble Lewis That Henry sole possessor of my love Is of a king become a banish'd man And forc'd to live in Scotland a forlorn While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York Usurps the regal title and the seat Of England 's true anointed lawful King This is the cause that I poor Margaret With this my son Prince Edward Henry 's heir Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid And if thou fail us all our hope is done Scotland hath will to help but can not help Our people and our peers are both misled Our treasure seiz'd our soldiers put to flight And as thou seest ourselves in heavy plight Renowned Queen with patience calm the storm While we bethink a means to break it off The more we stay the stronger grows our foe The more I stay the more I 'll succour thee O but impatience waiteth on true sorrow And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow What 's he approacheth boldly to our presence Our Earl of Warwick Edward 's greatest friend Welcome brave Warwick What brings thee to France Ay now begins a second storm to rise For this is he that moves both wind and tide From worthy Edward King of Albion My lord and sovereign and thy vowed friend I come in kindness and unfeigned love First to do greetings to thy royal person And then to crave a league of amity And lastly to confirm that amity With nuptial knot if thou vouchsafe to grant That virtuous Lady Bona thy fair sister To England 's King in lawful marriage Aside If that go forward Henry 's hope is done To BONA And gracious madam in our king 's behalf I am commanded with your leave and favour Humbly to kiss your hand and with my tongue To tell the passion of my sovereign 's heart Where fame late ent'ring at his heedful ears Hath plac'd thy beauty 's image and thy virtue King Lewis and Lady Bona hear me speak Before you answer Warwick His demand Springs not from Edward 's well meant honest love But from deceit bred by necessity For how can tyrants safely govern home Unless abroad they purchase great alliance To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice That Henry liveth still but were he dead Yet here Prince Edward stands King Henry 's son Look therefore Lewis that by this league and marriage Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour For though usurpers sway the rule a while Yet heav'ns are just and time suppresseth wrongs Injurious Margaret And why not Queen Because thy father Henry did usurp And thou no more art prince than she is queen Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain And after John of Gaunt Henry the Fourth Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest And after that wise prince Henry the Fifth Who by his prowess conquered all France From these our Henry lineally descends Oxford how haps it in this smooth discourse You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost All that which Henry the Fifth had gotten Methinks these peers of France should smile at that But for the rest you tell a pedigree Of threescore and two years- a silly time To make prescription for a kingdom 's worth Why Warwick canst thou speak against thy liege Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years And not betray thy treason with a blush Can Oxford that did ever fence the right Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree For shame Leave Henry and call Edward king Call him my king by whose injurious doom My elder brother the Lord Aubrey Vere Was done to death and more than so my father Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years When nature brought him to the door of death No Warwick no while life upholds this arm This arm upholds the house of Lancaster And I the house of York Queen Margaret Prince Edward and Oxford Vouchsafe at our request to stand aside While I use further conference with Warwick Heavens grant that Warwick 's words bewitch him not Now Warwick tell me even upon thy conscience Is Edward your true king for I were loath To link with him that were not lawful chosen Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour But is he gracious in the people 's eye The more that Henry was unfortunate Then further all dissembling set aside Tell me for truth the measure of his love Unto our sister Bona Such it seems As may beseem a monarch like himself Myself have often heard him say and swear That this his love was an eternal plant Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue 's ground The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty 's sun Exempt from envy but not from disdain Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain Now sister let us hear your firm resolve Your grant or your denial shall be mine To WARWICK Yet I confess that often ere this day When I have heard your king 's desert recounted Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire Then Warwick thus our sister shall be Edward 's And now forthwith shall articles be drawn Touching the jointure that your king must make Which with her dowry shall be counterpois'd Draw near Queen Margaret and be a witness That Bona shall be wife to the English king To Edward but not to the English king Deceitful Warwick it was thy device By this alliance to make void my suit Before thy coming Lewis was Henry 's friend And still is friend to him and Margaret But if your title to the crown be weak As may appear by Edward 's good success Then ' tis but reason that I be releas'd From giving aid which late I promised Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand That your estate requires and mine can yield Henry now lives in Scotland at his case Where having nothing nothing can he lose And as for you yourself our quondam queen You have a father able to maintain you And better ' twere you troubled him than France Peace impudent and shameless Warwick Proud setter up and puller down of kings I will not hence till with my talk and tears Both full of truth I make King Lewis behold Thy sly conveyance and thy lord 's false love For both of you are birds of self same feather Warwick this is some post to us or thee My lord ambassador these letters are for you Sent from your brother Marquis Montague These from our King unto your Majesty And madam these for you from whom I know not I like it well that our fair Queen and mistress Smiles at her news while Warwick frowns at his Nay mark how Lewis stamps as he were nettled I hope all 's for the best Warwick what are thy news And yours fair Queen Mine such as fill my heart with unhop'd joys Mine full of sorrow and heart 's discontent What has your king married the Lady Grey And now to soothe your forgery and his Sends me a paper to persuade me patience Is this th ' alliance that he seeks with France Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner I told your Majesty as much before This proveth Edward 's love and Warwick 's honesty King Lewis I here protest in sight of heaven And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's- No more my king for he dishonours me But most himself if he could see his shame Did I forget that by the house of York My father came untimely to his death Did I let pass th ' abuse done to my niece Did I impale him with the regal crown Did I put Henry from his native right And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame Shame on himself for my desert is honour And to repair my honour lost for him I here renounce him and return to Henry My noble Queen let former grudges pass And henceforth I am thy true servitor I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona And replant Henry in his former state Warwick these words have turn'd my hate to love And I forgive and quite forget old faults And joy that thou becom'st King Henry 's friend So much his friend ay his unfeigned friend That if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us With some few bands of chosen soldiers I 'll undertake to land them on our coast And force the tyrant from his seat by war ' Tis not his new made bride shall succour him And as for Clarence as my letters tell me He 's very likely now to fall from him For matching more for wanton lust than honour Or than for strength and safety of our country Dear brother how shall Bona be reveng'd But by thy help to this distressed queen Renowned Prince how shall poor Henry live Unless thou rescue him from foul despair My quarrel and this English queen 's are one And mine fair Lady Bona joins with yours And mine with hers and thine and Margaret 's Therefore at last I firmly am resolv'd You shall have aid Let me give humble thanks for all at once Then England 's messenger return in post And tell false Edward thy supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride Thou seest what 's past go fear thy king withal Tell him in hope he 'll prove a widower shortly I 'll wear the willow garland for his sake Tell him my mourning weeds are laid aside And I am ready to put armour on Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore I 'll uncrown him ere't be long There 's thy reward be gone Exit POST But Warwick Thou and Oxford with five thousand men Shall cross the seas and bid false Edward battle And as occasion serves this noble Queen And Prince shall follow with a fresh supply Yet ere thou go but answer me one doubt What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty This shall assure my constant loyalty That if our Queen and this young Prince agree I 'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands Yes I agree and thank you for your motion Son Edward she is fair and virtuous Therefore delay not- give thy hand to Warwick And with thy hand thy faith irrevocable That only Warwick 's daughter shall be thine Yes I accept her for she well deserves it And here to pledge my vow I give my hand stay we now These soldiers shall be levied And thou Lord Bourbon our High Admiral Shall waft them over with our royal fleet I long till Edward fall by war 's mischance For mocking marriage with a dame of France I came from Edward as ambassador But I return his sworn and mortal foe Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me But dreadful war shall answer his demand Had he none else to make a stale but me Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow I was the chief that rais'd him to the crown And I 'll be chief to bring him down again Not that I pity Henry 's misery But seek revenge on Edward 's mockery Exit Now tell me brother Clarence what think you Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey Hath not our brother made a worthy choice Alas you know ' tis far from hence to France How could he stay till Warwick made return My lords forbear this talk here comes the King And his well chosen bride I mind to tell him plainly what I think Now brother of Clarence how like you our choice That you stand pensive as half malcontent As well as Lewis of France or the Earl of Warwick Which are so weak of courage and in judgment That they 'll take no offence at our abuse Suppose they take offence without a cause They are but Lewis and Warwick I am Edward Your King and Warwick 's and must have my will And shall have your will because our King Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well Yea brother Richard are you offended too Not I. No God forbid that I should wish them sever'd Whom God hath join'd together ay and ' twere pity To sunder them that yoke so well together Setting your scorns and your mislike aside Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey Should not become my wife and England 's Queen And you too Somerset and Montague Speak freely what you think Then this is mine opinion that King Lewis Becomes your enemy for mocking him About the marriage of the Lady Bona And Warwick doing what you gave in charge Is now dishonoured by this new marriage What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeas'd By such invention as I can devise Yet to have join'd with France in such alliance Would more have strength'ned this our commonwealth ' Gainst foreign storms than any home bred marriage Why knows not Montague that of itself England is safe if true within itself But the safer when ' tis back'd with France ' Tis better using France than trusting France Let us be back'd with God and with the seas Which He hath giv'n for fence impregnable And with their helps only defend ourselves In them and in ourselves our safety lies For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford Ay what of that it was my will and grant And for this once my will shall stand for law And yet methinks your Grace hath not done well To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales Unto the brother of your loving bride She better would have fitted me or Clarence But in your bride you bury brotherhood Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife 's son And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere Alas poor Clarence Is it for a wife That thou art malcontent I will provide thee In choosing for yourself you show'd your judgment Which being shallow you shall give me leave To play the broker in mine own behalf And to that end I shortly mind to leave you Leave me or tarry Edward will be King And not be tied unto his brother 's will My lords before it pleas'd his Majesty To raise my state to title of a queen Do me but right and you must all confess That I was not ignoble of descent And meaner than myself have had like fortune But as this title honours me and mine So your dislikes to whom I would be pleasing Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow My love forbear to fawn upon their frowns What danger or what sorrow can befall thee So long as Edward is thy constant friend And their true sovereign whom they must obey Nay whom they shall obey and love thee too Unless they seek for hatred at my hands Which if they do yet will I keep thee safe And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath Aside I hear yet say not much but think the more Now messenger what letters or what news From France My sovereign liege no letters and few words But such as I without your special pardon Dare not relate Go to we pardon thee therefore in brief Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters At my depart these were his very words ' Go tell false Edward the supposed king That Lewis of France is sending over masquers To revel it with him and his new bride ' IS Lewis so brave Belike he thinks me Henry But what said Lady Bona to my marriage These were her words utt'red with mild disdain ' Tell him in hope he 'll prove a widower shortly I 'll wear the willow garland for his sake ' I blame not her she could say little less She had the wrong But what said Henry 's queen For I have heard that she was there in place ' Tell him ' quoth she ' my mourning weeds are done And I am ready to put armour on ' Belike she minds to play the Amazon But what said Warwick to these injuries He more incens'd against your Majesty Than all the rest discharg'd me with these words ' Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong And therefore I 'll uncrown him ere't be long ' Ha durst the traitor breathe out so proud words Well I will arm me being thus forewarn'd They shall have wars and pay for their presumption But say is Warwick friends with Margaret Ay gracious sovereign they are so link'd in friendship That young Prince Edward marries Warwick 's daughter Belike the elder Clarence will have the younger Now brother king farewell and sit you fast For I will hence to Warwick 's other daughter That though I want a kingdom yet in marriage I may not prove inferior to yourself You that love me and Warwick follow me Aside Not I. My thoughts aim at a further matter I Stay not for the love of Edward but the crown Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen And haste is needful in this desp'rate case Pembroke and Stafford you in our behalf Go levy men and make prepare for war They are already or quickly will be landed Myself in person will straight follow you So God help Montague as he proves true And Hastings as he favours Edward 's cause Now brother Richard will you stand by us Ay in despite of all that shall withstand you Why so then am I sure of victory Now therefore let us hence and lose no hour Till we meet Warwick with his foreign pow'r Exeunt Trust me my lord all hitherto goes well The common people by numbers swarm to us Fear not that my lord Then gentle Clarence welcome unto Warwick And welcome Somerset I hold it cowardice To rest mistrustful where a noble heart Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love Else might I think that Clarence Edward 's brother Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings But welcome sweet Clarence my daughter shall be thine And now what rests but in night 's coverture Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd His soldiers lurking in the towns about And but attended by a simple guard We may surprise and take him at our pleasure Our scouts have found the adventure very easy That as Ulysses and stout Diomede With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus ' tents And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds So we well cover'd with the night 's black mantle At unawares may beat down Edward 's guard And seize himself- I say not ' slaughter him ' For I intend but only to surprise him You that will follow me to this attempt Applaud the name of Henry with your leader Come on my masters each man take his stand The King by this is set him down to sleep What will he not to bed Why no for he hath made a solemn vow Never to lie and take his natural rest Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd To morrow then belike shall be the day If Warwick be so near as men report But say I pray what nobleman is that That with the King here resteth in his tent ' Tis the Lord Hastings the King 's chiefest friend O is it So But why commands the King That his chief followers lodge in towns about him While he himself keeps in the cold field ' Tis the more honour because more dangerous Ay but give me worship and quietness I like it better than dangerous honour If Warwick knew in what estate he stands ' Tis to be doubted he would waken him Unless our halberds did shut up his passage Ay wherefore else guard we his royal tent But to defend his person from night foes This is his tent and see where stand his guard Courage my masters Honour now or never But follow me and Edward shall be ours Who goes there Stay or thou diest What are they that fly there Richard and Hastings Let them go here is the Duke The Duke Why Warwick when we parted Thou call'dst me King Ay but the case is alter'd When you disgrac'd me in my embassade Then I degraded you from being King And come now to create you Duke of York Alas how should you govern any kingdom That know not how to use ambassadors Nor how to be contented with one wife Nor how to use your brothers brotherly Nor how to study for the people 's welfare Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies Yea brother of Clarence art thou here too Nay then I see that Edward needs must down Yet Warwick in despite of all mischance Of thee thyself and all thy complices Edward will always bear himself as King Though fortune 's malice overthrow my state My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel Then for his mind be Edward England 's king What fates impose that men must needs abide It boots not to resist both wind and tide What now remains my lords for us to do But march to London with our soldiers Ay that 's the first thing that we have to do To free King Henry from imprisonment And see him seated in the regal throne Exeunt Madam what makes you in this sudden change Why brother Rivers are you yet to learn What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward What loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick No but the loss of his own royal person Then is my sovereign slain Ay almost slain for he is taken prisoner Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard Or by his foe surpris'd at unawares And as I further have to understand Is new committed to the Bishop of York Fell Warwick 's brother and by that our foe These news I must confess are full of grief Yet gracious madam bear it as you may Warwick may lose that now hath won the day Till then fair hope must hinder life 's decay And I the rather wean me from despair For love of Edward 's offspring in my womb This is it that makes me bridle passion And bear with mildness my misfortune 's cross Ay ay for this I draw in many a tear And stop the rising of blood sucking sighs Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown King Edward 's fruit true heir to th ' English crown But madam where is Warwick then become I am inform'd that he comes towards London To set the crown once more on Henry 's head Guess thou the rest King Edward 's friends must down But to prevent the tyrant 's violence- For trust not him that hath once broken faith- I 'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary To save at least the heir of Edward 's right There shall I rest secure from force and fraud Come therefore let us fly while we may fly If Warwick take us we are sure to die Exeunt Now my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither Into this chiefest thicket of the park Thus stands the case you know our King my brother Is prisoner to the Bishop here at whose hands He hath good usage and great liberty And often but attended with weak guard Comes hunting this way to disport himself I have advertis'd him by secret means That if about this hour he make this way Under the colour of his usual game He shall here find his friends with horse and men To set him free from his captivity This way my lord for this way lies the game Nay this way man See where the huntsmen stand Now brother of Gloucester Lord Hastings and the rest Stand you thus close to steal the Bishop 's deer Brother the time and case requireth haste Your horse stands ready at the park corner But whither shall we then To Lynn my lord and shipt from thence to Flanders Well guess'd believe me for that was my meaning Stanley I will requite thy forwardness But wherefore stay we ' Tis no time to talk Huntsman what say'st thou Wilt thou go along Better do so than tarry and be hang'd Come then away let 's ha ' no more ado Bishop farewell Shield thee from Warwick 's frown And pray that I may repossess the crown Exeunt Master Lieutenant now that God and friends Have shaken Edward from the regal seat And turn'd my captive state to liberty My fear to hope my sorrows unto joys At our enlargement what are thy due fees Subjects may challenge nothing of their sov'reigns But if an humble prayer may prevail I then crave pardon of your Majesty For what Lieutenant For well using me Nay be thou sure I 'll well requite thy kindness For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure Ay such a pleasure as incaged birds Conceive when after many moody thoughts At last by notes of household harmony They quite forget their loss of liberty But Warwick after God thou set'st me free And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee He was the author thou the instrument Therefore that I may conquer fortune 's spite By living low where fortune can not hurt me And that the people of this blessed land May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars Warwick although my head still wear the crown I here resign my government to thee For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds Your Grace hath still been fam'd for virtuous And now may seem as wise as virtuous By spying and avoiding fortune 's malice For few men rightly temper with the stars Yet in this one thing let me blame your Grace For choosing me when Clarence is in place No Warwick thou art worthy of the sway To whom the heav'ns in thy nativity Adjudg'd an olive branch and laurel crown As likely to be blest in peace and war And therefore I yield thee my free consent And I choose Clarence only for Protector Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands Now join your hands and with your hands your hearts That no dissension hinder government I make you both Protectors of this land While I myself will lead a private life And in devotion spend my latter days To sin 's rebuke and my Creator 's praise What answers Clarence to his sovereign 's will That he consents if Warwick yield consent For on thy fortune I repose myself Why then though loath yet must I be content We 'll yoke together like a double shadow To Henry 's body and supply his place I mean in bearing weight of government While he enjoys the honour and his ease And Clarence now then it is more than needful Forthwith that Edward be pronounc'd a traitor And all his lands and goods confiscated What else And that succession be determin'd Ay therein Clarence shall not want his part But with the first of all your chief affairs Let me entreat- for I command no more- That Margaret your Queen and my son Edward Be sent for to return from France with speed For till I see them here by doubtful fear My joy of liberty is half eclips'd It shall be done my sovereign with all speed My Lord of Somerset what youth is that Of whom you seem to have so tender care My liege it is young Henry Earl of Richmond Come hither England 's hope What news my friend That Edward is escaped from your brother And fled as he hears since to Burgundy Unsavoury news But how made he escape He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester And the Lord Hastings who attended him In secret ambush on the forest side And from the Bishop 's huntsmen rescu'd him For hunting was his daily exercise My brother was too careless of his charge But let us hence my sovereign to provide A salve for any sore that may betide My lord I like not of this flight of Edward 's For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help And we shall have more wars befor't be long As Henry 's late presaging prophecy Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond So doth my heart misgive me in these conflicts What may befall him to his harm and ours Therefore Lord Oxford to prevent the worst Forthwith we 'll send him hence to Brittany Till storms be past of civil enmity Ay for if Edward repossess the crown ' Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down It shall be so he shall to Brittany Come therefore let 's about it speedily Exeunt Now brother Richard Lord Hastings and the rest Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends And says that once more I shall interchange My waned state for Henry 's regal crown Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas And brought desired help from Burgundy What then remains we being thus arriv'd From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York But that we enter as into our dukedom The gates made fast Brother I like not this For many men that stumble at the threshold Are well foretold that danger lurks within Tush man abodements must not now affright us By fair or foul means we must enter in For hither will our friends repair to us My liege I 'll knock once more to summon them My lords we were forewarned of your coming And shut the gates for safety of ourselves For now we owe allegiance unto Henry But Master Mayor if Henry be your King Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York True my good lord I know you for no less Why and I challenge nothing but my dukedom As being well content with that alone Aside But when the fox hath once got in his nose He 'll soon find means to make the body follow Why Master Mayor why stand you in a doubt Open the gates we are King Henry 's friends Ay say you so The gates shall then be open'd A wise stout captain and soon persuaded The good old man would fain that all were well So ' twere not long of him but being ent'red I doubt not I but we shall soon persuade Both him and all his brothers unto reason So Master Mayor These gates must not be shut But in the night or in the time of war What fear not man but yield me up the keys Brother this is Sir John Montgomery Our trusty friend unless I be deceiv'd Welcome Sir john But why come you in arms To help King Edward in his time of storm As every loyal subject ought to do Thanks good Montgomery but we now forget Our title to the crown and only claim Our dukedom till God please to send the rest Then fare you well for I will hence again I came to serve a king and not a duke Drummer strike up and let us march away Nay stay Sir John a while and we 'll debate By what safe means the crown may be recover'd What talk you of debating In few words If you 'll not here proclaim yourself our King I 'll leave you to your fortune and be gone To keep them back that come to succour you Why shall we fight if you pretend no title Why brother wherefore stand you on nice points When we grow stronger then we 'll make our claim Till then ' tis wisdom to conceal our meaning Away with scrupulous wit Now arms must rule And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns Brother we will proclaim you out of hand The bruit thereof will bring you many friends Then be it as you will for ' tis my right And Henry but usurps the diadem Ay now my sovereign speaketh like himself And now will I be Edward 's champion Sound trumpet Edward shall be here proclaim'd Come fellow soldier make thou proclamation Reads ' Edward the Fourth by the grace of God King of England and France and Lord of Ireland c. ' And whoso'er gainsays King Edward 's right By this I challenge him to single fight Long live Edward the Fourth Thanks brave Montgomery and thanks unto you all If fortune serve me I 'll requite this kindness Now for this night let 's harbour here in York And when the morning sun shall raise his car Above the border of this horizon We 'll forward towards Warwick and his mates For well I wot that Henry is no soldier Ah froward Clarence how evil it beseems the To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother Yet as we may we 'll meet both thee and Warwick Come on brave soldiers doubt not of the day And that once gotten doubt not of large pay Exeunt What counsel lords Edward from Belgia With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas And with his troops doth march amain to London And many giddy people flock to him Let 's levy men and beat him back again A little fire is quickly trodden out Which being suffer'd rivers can not quench In Warwickshire I have true hearted friends Not mutinous in peace yet bold in war Those will I muster up and thou son Clarence Shalt stir up in Suffolk Norfolk and in Kent The knights and gentlemen to come with thee Thou brother Montague in Buckingham Northampton and in Leicestershire shalt find Men well inclin'd to hear what thou command'st And thou brave Oxford wondrous well belov'd In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends My sovereign with the loving citizens Like to his island girt in with the ocean Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs Shall rest in London till we come to him Fair lords take leave and stand not to reply Farewell my sovereign Farewell my Hector and my Troy 's true hope In sign of truth I kiss your Highness ' hand Well minded Clarence be thou fortunate Comfort my lord and so I take my leave Kissing the KING 'S band And thus I seal my truth and bid adieu Sweet Oxford and my loving Montague And all at once once more a happy farewell Farewell sweet lords let 's meet at Coventry Here at the palace will I rest a while Cousin of Exeter what thinks your lordship Methinks the power that Edward hath in field Should not be able to encounter mine The doubt is that he will seduce the rest That 's not my fear my meed hath got me fame I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands Nor posted off their suits with slow delays My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs My mercy dried their water flowing tears I have not been desirous of their wealth Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies Nor forward of revenge though they much err'd Then why should they love Edward more than me No Exeter these graces challenge grace And when the lion fawns upon the lamb The lamb will never cease to follow him Hark hark my lord What shouts are these Seize on the shame fac'd Henry bear him hence And once again proclaim us King of England You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow Now stops thy spring my sea shall suck them dry And swell so much the higher by their ebb Hence with him to the Tower let him not speak Away betimes before his forces join And take the great grown traitor unawares Brave warriors march amain towards Coventry Exeunt Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford How far hence is thy lord mine honest fellow By this at Dunsmore marching hitherward How far off is our brother Montague Where is the post that came from Montague By this at Daintry with a puissant troop Say Somerville what says my loving son And by thy guess how nigh is Clarence now At Southam I did leave him with his forces And do expect him here some two hours hence Then Clarence is at hand I hear his drum It is not his my lord here Southam lies The drum your Honour hears marcheth from Warwick Who should that be Belike unlook'd for friends They are at hand and you shall quickly know Go trumpet to the walls and sound a parle See how the surly Warwick mans the wall O unbid spite Is sportful Edward come Where slept our scouts or how are they seduc'd That we could hear no news of his repair Now Warwick wilt thou ope the city gates Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee Call Edward King and at his hands beg mercy And he shall pardon thee these outrages Nay rather wilt thou draw thy forces hence Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee down Call Warwick patron and be penitent And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York I thought at least he would have said the King Or did he make the jest against his will Is not a dukedom sir a goodly gift Ay by my faith for a poor earl to give I 'll do thee service for so good a gift ' Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother Why then ' tis mine if but by Warwick 's gift Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight And weakling Warwick takes his gift again And Henry is my King Warwick his subject But Warwick 's king is Edward 's prisoner And gallant Warwick do but answer this What is the body when the head is off Alas that Warwick had no more forecast But whiles he thought to steal the single ten The king was slily finger'd from the deck You left poor Henry at the Bishop 's palace And ten to one you 'll meet him in the Tower ' Tis even so yet you are Warwick still Come Warwick take the time kneel down kneel down Nay when Strike now or else the iron cools I had rather chop this hand off at a blow And with the other fling it at thy face Than bear so low a sail to strike to thee Sail how thou canst have wind and tide thy friend This hand fast wound about thy coal black hair Shall whiles thy head is warm and new cut off Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood ' Wind changing Warwick now can change no more ' O cheerful colours See where Oxford comes Oxford Oxford for Lancaster The gates are open let us enter too So other foes may set upon our backs Stand we in good array for they no doubt Will issue out again and bid us battle If not the city being but of small defence We 'll quietly rouse the traitors in the same O welcome Oxford for we want thy help Montague Montague for Lancaster Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear The harder match'd the greater victory My mind presageth happy gain and conquest Somerset Somerset for Lancaster Two of thy name both Dukes of Somerset Have sold their lives unto the house of York And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold And lo where George of Clarence sweeps along Of force enough to bid his brother battle With whom an upright zeal to right prevails More than the nature of a brother 's love Clarence Clarence for Lancaster Et tu Brute- wilt thou stab Caesar too A parley sirrah to George of Clarence Come Clarence come Thou wilt if Warwick call Taking the red rose from his hat and throwing Now welcome more and ten times more belov'd Than if thou never hadst deserv'd our hate Welcome good Clarence this is brother like O passing traitor perjur'd and unjust What Warwick wilt thou leave die town and fight Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears Alas I am not coop'd here for defence I will away towards Barnet presently And bid thee battle Edward if thou dar'st Yes Warwick Edward dares and leads the way Lords to the field Saint George and victory So lie thou there Die thou and die our fear For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all Now Montague sit fast I seek for thee That Warwick 's bones may keep thine company Exit Ah who is nigh Come to me friend or foe And tell me who is victor York or Warwick Why ask I that My mangled body shows My blood my want of strength my sick heart shows That I must yield my body to the earth And by my fall the conquest to my foe Thus yields the cedar to the axe 's edge Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle Under whose shade the ramping lion slept Whose top branch overpeer'd Jove 's spreading tree And kept low shrubs from winter 's pow'rful wind These eyes that now are dimm'd with death 's black veil Have been as piercing as the mid day sun To search the secret treasons of the world The wrinkles in my brows now fill'd with blood Were lik'ned oft to kingly sepulchres For who liv'd King but I could dig his grave And who durst smile when Warwick bent his brow Lo now my glory smear'd in dust and blood My parks my walks my manors that I had Even now forsake me and of all my lands Is nothing left me but my body 's length what is pomp rule reign but earth and dust And live we how we can yet die we must Ah Warwick Warwick wert thou as we are We might recover all our loss again The Queen from France hath brought a puissant power Even now we heard the news Ah couldst thou fly Why then I would not fly Ah Montague If thou be there sweet brother take my hand And with thy lips keep in my soul a while Thou lov'st me not for brother if thou didst Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood That glues my lips and will not let me speak Come quickly Montague or I am dead Ah Warwick Montague hath breath'd his last And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick And said ' Commend me to my valiant brother ' And more he would have said and more he spoke Which sounded like a clamour in a vault That mought not be distinguish'd but at last I well might hear delivered with a groan ' O farewell Warwick ' Sweet rest his soul Fly lords and save yourselves For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven Away away to meet the Queen 's great power Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course And we are grac'd with wreaths of victory But in the midst of this bright shining day I spy a black suspicious threat'ning cloud That will encounter with our glorious sun Ere he attain his easeful western bed- I mean my lords those powers that the Queen Hath rais'd in Gallia have arriv'd our coast And as we hear march on to fight with us A little gale will soon disperse that cloud And blow it to the source from whence it came Thy very beams will dry those vapours up For every cloud engenders not a storm The Queen is valued thirty thousand strong And Somerset with Oxford fled to her If she have time to breathe be well assur'd Her faction will be full as strong as ours are advertis'd by our loving friends That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury We having now the best at Barnet field Will thither straight for willingness rids way And as we march our strength will be augmented In every county as we go along Strike up the drum cry ' Courage ' and away Exeunt Great lords wise men ne'er sit and wail their Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit Should if a coward hear her speak these words Infuse his breast with magnanimity And make him naked foil a man at arms I speak not this as doubting any here For did I but suspect a fearful man He should have leave to go away betimes Lest in our need he might infect another And make him of the like spirit to himself If any such be here- as God forbid!- Let him depart before we need his help Women and children of so high a courage And warriors faint Why ' twere perpetual shame O brave young Prince thy famous grandfather Doth live again in thee Long mayst thou Eve To bear his image and renew his glories And he that will not fight for such a hope Go home to bed and like the owl by day If he arise be mock'd and wond'red at Thanks gentle Somerset sweet Oxford thanks And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else Prepare you lords for Edward is at hand Ready to fight therefore be resolute I thought no less It is his policy To haste thus fast to find us unprovided But he 's deceiv'd we are in readiness This cheers my heart to see your forwardness Here pitch our battle hence we will not budge Brave followers yonder stands the thorny wood Which by the heavens ' assistance and your strength Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night I need not add more fuel to your fire For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out Give signal to the fight and to it lords Lords knights and gentlemen what I should say My tears gainsay for every word I speak Ye see I drink the water of my eye Therefore no more but this Henry your sovereign Is prisoner to the foe his state usurp'd His realm a slaughter house his subjects slain His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil You fight in justice Then in God 's name lords Be valiant and give signal to the fight Now here a period of tumultuous broils Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight For Somerset off with his guilty head Go bear them hence I will not hear them speak For my part I 'll not trouble thee with words Nor I but stoop with patience to my fortune So part we sadly in this troublous world To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem Is proclamation made that who finds Edward Shall have a high reward and he his life It is and lo where youthful Edward comes Bring forth the gallant let us hear him speak What can so young a man begin to prick Edward what satisfaction canst thou make For bearing arms for stirring up my subjects And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to Speak like a subject proud ambitious York Suppose that I am now my father 's mouth Resign thy chair and where I stand kneel thou Whilst I propose the self same words to the Which traitor thou wouldst have me answer to Ah that thy father had been so resolv'd That you might still have worn the petticoat And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster Let Aesop fable in a winter 's night His currish riddle sorts not with this place By heaven brat I 'll plague ye for that word Ay thou wast born to be a plague to men For God 's sake take away this captive scold Nay take away this scolding crookback rather Peace wilful boy or I will charm your tongue Untutor'd lad thou art too malapert I know my duty you are all undutiful Lascivious Edward and thou perjur'd George And thou misshapen Dick I tell ye all I am your better traitors as ye are And thou usurp'st my father 's right and mine Take that the likeness of this railer here Sprawl'st thou Take that to end thy agony And there 's for twitting me with perjury O kill me too Marry and shall Offers to kill her Hold Richard hold for we have done to much Why should she live to fill the world with words What doth she swoon Use means for her recovery Clarence excuse me to the King my brother I 'll hence to London on a serious matter Ere ye come there be sure to hear some news What what The Tower the Tower Exit O Ned sweet Ned speak to thy mother boy Canst thou not speak O traitors murderers They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all Did not offend nor were not worthy blame If this foul deed were by to equal it He was a man this in respect a child And men ne'er spend their fury on a child What 's worse than murderer that I may name it No no my heart will burst an if I speak- And I will speak that so my heart may burst Butchers and villains bloody cannibals How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd You have no children butchers if you had The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse But if you ever chance to have a child Look in his youth to have him so cut off As deathsmen you have rid this sweet young prince Away with her go bear her hence perforce Nay never bear me hence dispatch me here Here sheathe thy sword I 'll pardon thee my death What wilt thou not Then Clarence do it thou By heaven I will not do thee so much ease Good Clarence do sweet Clarence do thou do it Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it Ay but thou usest to forswear thyself ' Twas sin before but now ' tis charity What wilt thou not Where is that devil 's butcher Hard favour'd Richard Richard where art thou Thou art not here Murder is thy alms deed Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back Away I say I charge ye bear her hence So come to you and yours as to this prince Where 's Richard gone To London all in post and as I guess To make a bloody supper in the Tower He 's sudden if a thing comes in his head Now march we hence Discharge the common sort With pay and thanks and let 's away to London And see our gentle queen how well she fares By this I hope she hath a son for me Exeunt Good day my lord What at your book so hard Ay my good lord- my lord I should say rather ' Tis sin to flatter ' good ' was little better ' Good Gloucester ' and ' good devil ' were alike And both preposterous therefore not ' good lord ' Sirrah leave us to ourselves we must confer So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece And next his throat unto the butcher 's knife What scene of death hath Roscius now to act Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind The thief doth fear each bush an officer The bird that hath been limed in a bush With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush And I the hapless male to one sweet bird Have now the fatal object in my eye Where my poor young was lim'd was caught and kill'd Why what a peevish fool was that of Crete That taught his son the office of a fowl And yet for all his wings the fool was drown'd I Daedalus my poor boy Icarus Thy father Minos that denied our course The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy Thy brother Edward and thyself the sea Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life Ah kill me with thy weapon not with words My breast can better brook thy dagger 's point Than can my ears that tragic history But wherefore dost thou come Is't for my life Think'st thou I am an executioner A persecutor I am sure thou art If murdering innocents be executing Why then thou are an executioner Thy son I kill'd for his presumption Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume Thou hadst not liv'd to kill a son of mine And thus I prophesy that many a thousand Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear And many an old man 's sigh and many a widow 's And many an orphan 's water standing eye- Men for their sons wives for their husbands Orphans for their parents ' timeless death- Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born The owl shriek'd at thy birth- an evil sign The night crow cried aboding luckless time Dogs howl'd and hideous tempest shook down trees The raven rook'd her on the chimney 's top And chatt'ring pies in dismal discords sung Thy mother felt more than a mother 's pain And yet brought forth less than a mother 's hope To wit an indigest deformed lump Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born To signify thou cam'st to bite the world And if the rest be true which I have heard Thou cam'st- I 'll hear no more Die prophet in thy speech Ay and for much more slaughter after this O God forgive my sins and pardon thee Dies What will the aspiring blood of Lancaster Sink in the ground I thought it would have mounted See how my sword weeps for the poor King 's death O may such purple tears be always shed From those that wish the downfall of our house If any spark of life be yet remaining Down down to hell and say I sent thee thither- Once more we sit in England 's royal throne Repurchas'd with the blood of enemies What valiant foemen like to autumn 's corn Have we mow'd down in tops of all their pride Three Dukes of Somerset threefold renown'd For hardy and undoubted champions Two Cliffords as the father and the son And two Northumberlands- two braver men Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet 's sound With them the two brave bears Warwick and Montague That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion And made the forest tremble when they roar'd Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat And made our footstool of security Come hither Bess and let me kiss my boy Young Ned for thee thine uncles and myself Have in our armours watch'd the winter 's night Went all afoot in summer 's scalding heat That thou might'st repossess the crown in peace And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain Aside I 'll blast his harvest if your head were laid For yet I am not look'd on in the world This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave And heave it shall some weight or break my back Work thou the way- and that shall execute Clarence and Gloucester love my lovely queen And kiss your princely nephew brothers both The duty that I owe unto your Majesty I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe Thanks noble Clarence worthy brother thanks And that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit Aside To say the truth so Judas kiss'd his master And cried ' All hail ' when as he meant all harm Now am I seated as my soul delights Having my country 's peace and brothers ' loves What will your Grace have done with Margaret Reignier her father to the King of France Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem And hither have they sent it for her ransom Away with her and waft her hence to France And now what rests but that we spend the time With stately triumphs mirthful comic shows Such as befits the pleasure of the court Sound drums and trumpets Farewell sour annoy For here I hope begins our lasting joy Exeunt Good morrow and well met How have ye done Since last we saw in France I thank your Grace Healthful and ever since a fresh admirer Of what I saw there An untimely ague Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when Those suns of glory those two lights of men Met in the vale of Andren ' Twixt Guynes and Arde- I was then present saw them salute on horseback Beheld them when they lighted how they clung In their embracement as they grew together Which had they what four thron'd ones could have weigh'd Such a compounded one All the whole time I was my chamber 's prisoner Then you lost The view of earthly glory men might say Till this time pomp was single but now married To one above itself Each following day Became the next day 's master till the last Made former wonders its To day the French All clinquant all in gold like heathen gods Shone down the English and to morrow they Made Britain India every man that stood Show'd like a mine Their dwarfish pages were As cherubins an gilt the madams too Not us'd to toil did almost sweat to bear The pride upon them that their very labour Was to them as a painting Now this masque Was cried incomparable and th ' ensuing night Made it a fool and beggar The two kings Equal in lustre were now best now worst As presence did present them him in eye still him in praise and being present both ' Twas said they saw but one and no discerner Durst wag his tongue in censure When these suns- For so they phrase 'em by their heralds challeng'd The noble spirits to arms they did perform Beyond thought 's compass that former fabulous story Being now seen possible enough got credit That Bevis was believ'd O you go far As I belong to worship and affect In honour honesty the tract of ev'rything Would by a good discourser lose some life Which action 's self was tongue to All was royal To the disposing of it nought rebell'd Order gave each thing view The office did Distinctly his full function Who did guide- I mean who set the body and the limbs Of this great sport together as you guess One certes that promises no element In such a business I pray you who my lord All this was ord'red by the good discretion Of the right reverend Cardinal of York The devil speed him No man 's pie is freed From his ambitious finger What had he To do in these fierce vanities I wonder That such a keech can with his very bulk Take up the rays o ' th ' beneficial sun And keep it from the earth Surely sir There 's in him stuff that puts him to these ends For being not propp'd by ancestry whose grace Chalks successors their way nor call'd upon For high feats done to th ' crown neither allied To eminent assistants but spider like Out of his self drawing web ' a gives us note The force of his own merit makes his way- A gift that heaven gives for him which buys A place next to the King I can not tell What heaven hath given him let some graver eye Pierce into that but I can see his pride Peep through each part of him Whence has he that If not from hell the devil is a niggard Or has given all before and he begins A new hell in himself Why the devil Upon this French going out took he upon him- Without the privity o ' th ' King t ' appoint Who should attend on him He makes up the file Of all the gentry for the most part such To whom as great a charge as little honour He meant to lay upon and his own letter The honourable board of council out Must fetch him in he papers I do know Kinsmen of mine three at the least that have By this so sicken'd their estates that never They shall abound as formerly O many Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em For this great journey What did this vanity But minister communication of A most poor issue Grievingly I think The peace between the French and us not values The cost that did conclude it Every man After the hideous storm that follow'd was A thing inspir'd and not consulting broke Into a general prophecy that this tempest Dashing the garment of this peace aboded The sudden breach on't Which is budded out For France hath flaw'd the league and hath attach'd Our merchants ' goods at Bordeaux Is it therefore Th ' ambassador is silenc'd Marry is't A proper tide of a peace and purchas'd At a superfluous rate Why all this business Our reverend Cardinal carried Like it your Grace The state takes notice of the private difference Betwixt you and the Cardinal I advise you- And take it from a heart that wishes towards you Honour and plenteous safety that you read The Cardinal 's malice and his potency Together to consider further that What his high hatred would effect wants not A minister in his power You know his nature That he 's revengeful and I know his sword Hath a sharp edge it 's long and't may be said It reaches far and where ' twill not extend Thither he darts it Bosom up my counsel You 'll find it wholesome Lo where comes that rock That I advise your shunning The Duke of Buckingham 's surveyor Ha Where 's his examination Here so please you Is he in person ready Ay please your Grace Well we shall then know more and Buckingham shall lessen this big look This butcher 's cur is venom mouth'd and I Have not the power to muzzle him therefore best Not wake him in his slumber A beggar 's book Outworths a noble 's blood What are you chaf'd Ask God for temp'rance that 's th ' appliance only Which your disease requires I read in 's looks Matter against me and his eye revil'd Me as his abject object At this instant He bores me with some trick He 's gone to th ' King I 'll follow and outstare him Stay my lord And let your reason with your choler question What ' tis you go about To climb steep hills Requires slow pace at first Anger is like A full hot horse who being allow'd his way Self mettle tires him Not a man in England Can advise me like you be to yourself As you would to your friend I 'll to the King And from a mouth of honour quite cry down This Ipswich fellow 's insolence or proclaim There 's difference in no persons Be advis'd Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot That it do singe yourself We may outrun By violent swiftness that which we run at And lose by over running Know you not The fire that mounts the liquor till't run o'er In seeming to augment it wastes it Be advis'd I say again there is no English soul More stronger to direct you than yourself If with the sap of reason you would quench Or but allay the fire of passion Sir I am thankful to you and I 'll go along By your prescription but this top proud fellow- Whom from the flow of gan I name not but From sincere motions by intelligence And proofs as clear as founts in July when We see each grain of gravel I do know To be corrupt and treasonous Say not treasonous To th ' King I 'll say't and make my vouch as strong As shore of rock Attend this holy fox Or wolf or both for he is equal rav'nous As he is subtle and as prone to mischief As able to perform't his mind and place Infecting one another yea reciprocally- Only to show his pomp as well in France As here at home suggests the King our master To this last costly treaty th ' interview That swallowed so much treasure and like a glass Did break i ' th ' wrenching Faith and so it did Pray give me favour sir this cunning cardinal The articles o ' th ' combination drew As himself pleas'd and they were ratified As he cried ' Thus let be ' to as much end As give a crutch to th ' dead But our Count Cardinal Has done this and ' tis well for worthy Wolsey Who can not err he did it Now this follows Which as I take it is a kind of puppy To th ' old dam treason Charles the Emperor Under pretence to see the Queen his aunt- For ' twas indeed his colour but he came To whisper Wolsey here makes visitation- His fears were that the interview betwixt England and France might through their amity Breed him some prejudice for from this league Peep'd harms that menac'd him privily Deals with our Cardinal and as I trow- Which I do well for I am sure the Emperor Paid ere he promis'd whereby his suit was granted Ere it was ask'd but when the way was made And pav'd with gold the Emperor thus desir'd That he would please to alter the King 's course And break the foresaid peace Let the King know As soon he shall by me that thus the Cardinal Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases And for his own advantage I am sorry To hear this of him and could wish he were Something mistaken in't No not a syllable I do pronounce him in that very shape He shall appear in proof Your office sergeant execute it Sir My lord the Duke of Buckingham and Earl Of Hereford Stafford and Northampton I Arrest thee of high treason in the name Of our most sovereign King Lo you my lord The net has fall'n upon me I shall perish Under device and practice I am sorry To see you ta'en from liberty to look on The business present ' tis his Highness ' pleasure You shall to th ' Tower It will help nothing To plead mine innocence for that dye is on me Which makes my whit'st part black The will of heav'n Be done in this and all things I obey O my Lord Aberga'ny fare you well Nay he must bear you company To ABERGAVENNY The King Is pleas'd you shall to th ' Tower till you know How he determines further As the Duke said The will of heaven be done and the King 's pleasure By me obey'd Here is warrant from The King t ' attach Lord Montacute and the bodies Of the Duke 's confessor John de la Car One Gilbert Peck his chancellor- So so These are the limbs o ' th ' plot no more I hope A monk o ' th ' Chartreux O Nicholas Hopkins He My surveyor is false The o'er great Cardinal Hath show'd him gold my life is spann'd already I am the shadow of poor Buckingham Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on By dark'ning my clear sun My lord farewell Exeunt My life itself and the best heart of it Thanks you for this great care I stood i ' th ' level Of a full charg'd confederacy and give thanks To you that chok'd it Let be call'd before us That gentleman of Buckingham 's In person I 'll hear his confessions justify And point by point the treasons of his master He shall again relate Nay we must longer kneel I am suitor Arise and take place by us Half your suit Never name to us you have half our power The other moiety ere you ask is given Repeat your will and take it Thank your Majesty That you would love yourself and in that love Not unconsidered leave your honour nor The dignity of your office is the point Of my petition Lady mine proceed I am solicited not by a few And those of true condition that your subjects Are in great grievance there have been commissions Sent down among 'em which hath flaw'd the heart Of all their loyalties wherein although My good Lord Cardinal they vent reproaches Most bitterly on you as putter on Of these exactions yet the King our master- Whose honour Heaven shield from soil!-even he escapes not Language unmannerly yea such which breaks The sides of loyalty and almost appears In loud rebellion Not almost appears- It doth appear for upon these taxations The clothiers all not able to maintain The many to them ' longing have put of The spinsters carders fullers weavers who Unfit for other life compell'd by hunger And lack of other means in desperate manner Daring th ' event to th ' teeth are all in uproar And danger serves among them Taxation Wherein and what taxation My Lord Cardinal You that are blam'd for it alike with us Know you of this taxation Please you sir I know but of a single part in aught Pertains to th ' state and front but in that file Where others tell steps with me No my lord You know no more than others But you frame Things that are known alike which are not wholesome To those which would not know them and yet must Perforce be their acquaintance These exactions Whereof my sovereign would have note they are Most pestilent to th ' hearing and to bear 'em The back is sacrifice to th ' load They say They are devis'd by you or else you suffer Too hard an exclamation Still exaction The nature of it In what kind let 's know Is this exaction I am much too venturous In tempting of your patience but am bold'ned Under your promis'd pardon The subjects ' grief Comes through commissions which compels from each The sixth part of his substance to be levied Without delay and the pretence for this Is nam'd your wars in France This makes bold mouths Tongues spit their duties out and cold hearts freeze Allegiance in them their curses now Live where their prayers did and it 's come to pass This tractable obedience is a slave To each incensed will I would your Highness Would give it quick consideration for There is no primer business By my life This is against our pleasure And for me I have no further gone in this than by A single voice and that not pass'd me but By learned approbation of the judges If I am Traduc'd by ignorant tongues which neither know My faculties nor person yet will be The chronicles of my doing let me say ' Tis but the fate of place and the rough brake That virtue must go through We must not stint Our necessary actions in the fear To cope malicious censurers which ever As rav'nous fishes do a vessel follow That is new trimm'd but benefit no further Than vainly longing What we oft do best By sick interpreters once weak ones is Not ours or not allow'd what worst as oft Hitting a grosser quality is cried up For our best act If we shall stand still In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at We should take root here where we sit or sit State statues only Things done well And with a care exempt themselves from fear Things done without example in their issue Are to be fear'd Have you a precedent Of this commission I believe not any We must not rend our subjects from our laws And stick them in our will Sixth part of each A trembling contribution Why we take From every tree lop bark and part o ' th ' timber And though we leave it with a root thus hack'd The air will drink the sap To every county Where this is question'd send our letters with Free pardon to each man that has denied The force of this commission Pray look tot I put it to your care Aside to the SECRETARY A word with you Let there be letters writ to every shire Of the King 's grace and pardon The grieved commons Hardly conceive of me let it be nois'd That through our intercession this revokement And pardon comes I shall anon advise you Further in the proceeding Exit SECRETARY I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham Is run in your displeasure It grieves many The gentleman is learn'd and a most rare speaker To nature none more bound his training such That he may furnish and instruct great teachers And never seek for aid out of himself Yet see When these so noble benefits shall prove Not well dispos'd the mind growing once corrupt They turn to vicious forms ten times more ugly Than ever they were fair This man so complete Who was enroll'd ' mongst wonders and when we Almost with ravish'd list'ning could not find His hour of speech a minute he my lady Hath into monstrous habits put the graces That once were his and is become as black As if besmear'd in hell Sit by us you shall hear- This was his gentleman in trust of him Things to strike honour sad Bid him recount The fore recited practices whereof We can not feel too little hear too much Stand forth and with bold spirit relate what you Most like a careful subject have collected Out of the Duke of Buckingham Speak freely First it was usual with him every day It would infect his speech that if the King Should without issue die he 'll carry it so To make the sceptre his These very words I 've heard him utter to his son in law Lord Aberga'ny to whom by oath he menac'd Revenge upon the Cardinal Please your Highness note This dangerous conception in this point Not friended by his wish to your high person His will is most malignant and it stretches Beyond you to your friends My learn'd Lord Cardinal Deliver all with charity Speak on How grounded he his title to the crown Upon our fail To this point hast thou heard him At any time speak aught He was brought to this By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Henton What was that Henton Sir a Chartreux friar His confessor who fed him every minute With words of sovereignty How know'st thou this Not long before your Highness sped to France The Duke being at the Rose within the parish Saint Lawrence Poultney did of me demand What was the speech among the Londoners Concerning the French journey I replied Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious To the King 's danger Presently the Duke Said ' twas the fear indeed and that he doubted ' Twould prove the verity of certain words Spoke by a holy monk ' that oft ' says he ' Hath sent to me wishing me to permit John de la Car my chaplain a choice hour To hear from him a matter of some moment Whom after under the confession 's seal He solemnly had sworn that what he spoke My chaplain to no creature living but To me should utter with demure confidence This pausingly ensu'd Neither the King nor 's heirs Tell you the Duke shall prosper bid him strive To gain the love o ' th ' commonalty the Duke Shall govern England ' If I know you well You were the Duke 's surveyor and lost your office On the complaint o ' th ' tenants Take good heed You charge not in your spleen a noble person And spoil your nobler soul I say take heed Yes heartily beseech you Let him on Go forward On my soul I 'll speak but truth I told my lord the Duke by th ' devil 's illusions The monk might be deceiv'd and that ' twas dangerous Ha what so rank Ah ha There 's mischief in this man Canst thou say further I can my liege Proceed Being at Greenwich After your Highness had reprov'd the Duke About Sir William Bulmer- I remember Of such a time being my sworn servant The Duke retain'd him his But on what hence ' If ' quoth he ' I for this had been committed- As to the Tower I thought I would have play'd The part my father meant to act upon Th ' usurper Richard who being at Salisbury Made suit to come in 's presence which if granted As he made semblance of his duty would Have put his knife into him ' A giant traitor Now madam may his Highness live in freedom And this man out of prison God mend all There 's something more would out of thee what say'st After ' the Duke his father ' with the ' knife ' He stretch'd him and with one hand on his dagger Another spread on 's breast mounting his eyes He did discharge a horrible oath whose tenour Was were he evil us'd he would outgo His father by as much as a performance Does an irresolute purpose There 's his period To sheath his knife in us He is attach'd Call him to present trial If he may Find mercy in the law ' tis his if none Let him not seek't of us By day and night He 's traitor to th ' height Exeunt Is't possible the spells of France should juggle Men into such strange mysteries New customs Though they be never so ridiculous Nay let 'em be unmanly yet are follow'd As far as I see all the good our English Have got by the late voyage is but merely A fit or two o ' th ' face but they are shrewd ones For when they hold 'em you would swear directly Their very noses had been counsellors To Pepin or Clotharius they keep state so They have all new legs and lame ones One would take it That never saw 'em pace before the spavin Or springhalt reign'd among 'em Death my lord Their clothes are after such a pagan cut to't That sure th ' have worn out Christendom Faith my lord I hear of none but the new proclamation That 's clapp'd upon the court gate What is't for The reformation of our travell'd gallants That fill the court with quarrels talk and tailors I am glad ' tis there Now I would pray our monsieurs To think an English courtier may be wise And never see the Louvre They must either For so run the conditions leave those remnants Of fool and feather that they got in France With all their honourable points of ignorance Pertaining thereunto as fights and fireworks Abusing better men than they can be Out of a foreign wisdom renouncing clean The faith they have in tennis and tall stockings Short blist'red breeches and those types of travel And understand again like honest men Or pack to their old playfellows There I take it They may cum privilegio wear away The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at ' Tis time to give 'em physic their diseases Are grown so catching What a loss our ladies Will have of these trim vanities Ay marry There will be woe indeed lords the sly whoresons Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies A French song and a fiddle has no fellow The devil fiddle 'em I am glad they are going For sure there 's no converting 'em Now An honest country lord as I am beaten A long time out of play may bring his plainsong And have an hour of hearing and by'r Lady Held current music too Well said Lord Sandys Your colt 's tooth is not cast yet No my lord Nor shall not while I have a stamp Sir Thomas Whither were you a going To the Cardinal 's Your lordship is a guest too O ' tis true This night he makes a supper and a great one To many lords and ladies there will be The beauty of this kingdom I 'll assure you That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us His dews fall everywhere No doubt he 's

How now what is't A noble troop of strangers- For so they seem Th ' have left their barge and landed And hither make as great ambassadors From foreign princes Good Lord Chamberlain Go give 'em welcome you can speak the French tongue And pray receive 'em nobly and conduct 'em Into our presence where this heaven of beauty Shall shine at full upon them Some attend him Because they speak no English thus they pray'd To tell your Grace that having heard by fame Of this so noble and so fair assembly This night to meet here they could do no less Out of the great respect they bear to beauty But leave their flocks and under your fair conduct Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat An hour of revels with 'em Say Lord Chamberlain They have done my poor house grace for which I pay 'em A thousand thanks and pray 'em take their pleasures The fairest hand I ever touch'd O beauty Till now I never knew thee Music Dance My lord Your Grace Pray tell 'em thus much from me There should be one amongst

they would have your Grace Find out and he will take it Let me see then Comes from his state By all your good leaves gentlemen here I 'll make My royal choice Unmasking Ye have found him Cardinal You

ladies ev'ry one Sweet partner I must not yet forsake you Let 's be merry Good my Lord Cardinal I have half a dozen healths To drink to these fair ladies and a measure To lead 'em once again and then let 's dream Who 's best in favour Let the music knock it Whither away so fast O God save ye Ev'n to the Hall to hear what shall become Of the great Duke of Buckingham I 'll save you That labour sir All 's now done but the ceremony Of bringing back the prisoner Were you there Yes indeed was I. Pray speak what has happen'd You may guess quickly what Is he found guilty Yes truly is he and condemn'd upon't I am sorry for't So are a number more But pray how pass'd it I 'll tell you in a little The great Duke Came to the bar where to his accusations He pleaded still not guilty and alleged Many sharp reasons to defeat the law The King 's attorney on the contrary Urg'd on the examinations proofs confessions Of divers witnesses which the Duke desir'd To have brought viva voce to his face At which appear'd against him his surveyor Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor and John Car Confessor to him with that devil monk Hopkins that made this mischief That was he That fed him with his prophecies The same All these accus'd him strongly which he fain Would have flung from him but indeed he could not And so his peers upon this evidence Have found him guilty of high treason Much He spoke and learnedly for life but all Was either pitied in him or forgotten After all this how did he bear him self When he was brought again to th ' bar to hear His knell rung out his judgment he was stirr'd With such an agony he sweat extremely And something spoke in choler ill and hasty But he fell to himself again and sweetly In all the rest show'd a most noble patience I do not think he fears death Sure he does not He never was so womanish the cause He may a little grieve at Certainly The Cardinal is the end of this ' Tis likely By all conjectures first Kildare 's attainder Then deputy of Ireland who remov'd Earl Surrey was sent thither and in haste too Lest he should help his father That trick of state Was a deep envious one At his return No doubt he will requite it This is noted And generally whoever the King favours The Cardinal instantly will find employment And far enough from court too All the commons Hate him perniciously and o ' my conscience Wish him ten fathom deep this Duke as much They love and dote on call him bounteous Buckingham The mirror of all courtesy- Stay there sir And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of Let 's stand close and behold him All good people You that thus far have come to pity me Hear what I say and then go home and lose me I have this day receiv'd a traitor 's judgment And by that name must die yet heaven bear witness And if I have a conscience let it sink me Even as the axe falls if I be not faithful The law I bear no malice for my death ' T has done upon the premises but justice But those that sought it I could wish more Christians Be what they will I heartily forgive 'em Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief Nor build their evils on the graves of great men For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em For further life in this world I ne'er hope Nor will I sue although the King have mercies More than I dare make faults You few that lov'd me And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham His noble friends and fellows whom to leave Is only bitter to him only dying Go with me like good angels to my end And as the long divorce of steel falls on me Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice And lift my soul to heaven Lead on a God 's name I do beseech your Grace for charity If ever any malice in your heart Were hid against me now to forgive me frankly Sir Thomas Lovell I as free forgive you As I would be forgiven I forgive all There can not be those numberless offences ' Gainst me that I can not take peace with No black envy Shall mark my grave Commend me to his Grace And if he speak of Buckingham pray tell him You met him half in heaven My vows and prayers Yet are the King 's and till my soul forsake Shall cry for blessings on him May he live Longer than I have time to tell his years Ever belov'd and loving may his rule be And when old time Shall lead him to his end Goodness and he fill up one monument To th ' water side I must conduct your Grace Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux Who undertakes you to your end Prepare there The Duke is coming see the barge be ready And fit it with such furniture as suits The greatness of his person Nay Sir Nicholas Let it alone my state now will but mock me When I came hither I was Lord High Constable And Duke of Buckingham now poor Edward Bohun Yet I am richer than my base accusers That never knew what truth meant I now seal it And with that blood will make 'em one day groan fort My noble father Henry of Buckingham Who first rais'd head against usurping Richard Flying for succour to his servant Banister Being distress'd was by that wretch betray'd And without trial fell God 's peace be with him Henry the Seventh succeeding truly pitying My father 's loss like a most royal prince Restor'd me to my honours and out of ruins Made my name once more noble Now his son Henry the Eighth life honour name and all That made me happy at one stroke has taken For ever from the world I had my trial And must needs say a noble one which makes me A little happier than my wretched father Yet thus far we are one in fortunes both Fell by our servants by those men we lov'd most- A most unnatural and faithless service Heaven has an end in all Yet you that hear me This from a dying man receive as certain Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels Be sure you be not loose for those you make friends And give your hearts to when they once perceive The least rub in your fortunes fall away Like water from ye never found again But where they mean to sink ye All good people Pray for me I must now forsake ye the last hour Of my long weary life is come upon me Farewell And when you would say something that is sad Speak how I fell I have done and God forgive me O this is full of pity Sir it calls I fear too many curses on their heads That were the authors If the Duke be guiltless ' Tis full of woe yet I can give you inkling Of an ensuing evil if it fall Greater than this Good angels keep it from us What may it be You do not doubt my faith sir This secret is so weighty ' twill require A strong faith to conceal it Let me have it I do not talk much I am confident You shall sir Did you not of late days hear A buzzing of a separation Between the King and Katharine Yes but it held not For when the King once heard it out of anger He sent command to the Lord Mayor straight To stop the rumour and allay those tongues That durst disperse it But that slander sir Is found a truth now for it grows again Fresher than e'er it was and held for certain The King will venture at it Either the Cardinal Or some about him near have out of malice To the good Queen possess'd him with a scruple That will undo her To confirm this too Cardinal Campeius is arriv'd and lately As all think for this business ' Tis the Cardinal And merely to revenge him on the Emperor For not bestowing on him at his asking The archbishopric of Toledo this is purpos'd I think you have hit the mark but is't ' Tis woeful We are too open here to argue this Let 's think in private more Exeunt ' My lord ' The horses your lordship sent for with all the care had I saw well chosen ridden and furnish'd They were young and handsome and of the best breed in the north When they were ready to set out for London a man of my Lord Cardinal 's by commission and main power took 'em from me with this reason his master would be serv'd before a subject if not before the King which stopp'd our mouths sir ' Well met my Lord Chamberlain Good day to both your Graces How is the King employ'd I left him private Full of sad thoughts and troubles What 's the cause It seems the marriage with his brother 's wife Has crept too near his conscience No his conscience Has crept too near another lady ' Tis so This is the Cardinal 's doing the King Cardinal That blind priest like the eldest son of fortune Turns what he list The King will know him one day Pray God he do He 'll never know himself else How holily he works in all his business And with what zeal For now he has crack'd the league Between us and the Emperor the Queen 's great nephew He dives into the King 's soul and there scatters Dangers doubts wringing of the conscience Fears and despairs and all these for his marriage And out of all these to restore the King He counsels a divorce a loss of her That like a jewel has hung twenty years About his neck yet never lost her lustre Of her that loves him with that excellence That angels love good men with even of her That when the greatest stroke of fortune falls Will bless the King and is not this course pious Heaven keep me from such counsel ' Tis most true These news are everywhere every tongue speaks 'em And every true heart weeps for ' t. All that dare Look into these affairs see this main end- The French King 's sister Heaven will one day open The King 's eyes that so long have slept upon This bold bad man And free us from his slavery We had need pray and heartily for our deliverance Or this imperious man will work us an From princes into pages All men 's honours Lie like one lump before him to be fashion'd Into what pitch he please For me my lords I love him not nor fear him there 's my creed As I am made without him so I 'll stand If the King please his curses and his blessings Touch me alike th ' are breath I not believe in I knew him and I know him so I leave him To him that made him proud the Pope Let 's in And with some other business put the King From these sad thoughts that work too much upon him My lord you 'll bear us company Excuse me The King has sent me otherwhere besides You 'll find a most unfit time to disturb him Health to your lordships Thanks my good Lord Chamberlain How sad he looks sure he is much afflicted Who 's there ha Pray God he be not angry Who 's there I say How dare you thrust yourselves Into my private meditations Who am I ha A gracious king that pardons all offences Malice ne'er meant Our breach of duty this way Is business of estate in which we come To know your royal pleasure Ye are too bold Go to I 'll make ye know your times of business Is this an hour for temporal affairs ha Sir you can not I would your Grace would give us but an hour Of private conference To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK We are busy go Aside to SUFFOLK This priest has no pride in him Aside to NORFOLK Not to speak of I would not be so sick though for his place But this can not continue Aside to SUFFOLK If it do I 'll venture one have at him Aside to NORFOLK I another Your Grace has given a precedent of wisdom Above all princes in committing freely Your scruple to the voice of Christendom Who can be angry now What envy reach you The Spaniard tied by blood and favour to her Must now

hath sent One general tongue unto us this good man This just and learned priest Cardinal Campeius Whom once more I present unto your Highness And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome And thank the

hand much Aside to WOLSEY But to be commanded For ever by your Grace whose hand has rais'd me Come hither Gardiner Walks and whispers My Lord of York was not one Doctor Pace In this man 's place before him Yes he was Was he not held a learned man Yes surely Believe me there 's an ill opinion spread then Even of yourself Lord Cardinal How Of me They will not stick to say you envied him And fearing he would rise he was so virtuous Kept him a foreign man still which so griev'd him That he ran mad and died Heav'n 's peace be with him That 's Christian care enough For living murmurers There 's places of rebuke He was a fool For he would needs be virtuous that good fellow If I command him follows my appointment I will have none so near else Learn this brother We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons Deliver this with modesty to th ' Queen Not for that neither Here 's the pang that pinches His Highness having liv'd so long with her and she So good a lady that no tongue could ever Pronounce dishonour of her by my life She never knew harm doing O now after So many courses of the sun enthroned Still growing in a majesty and pomp the which To leave a thousand fold more bitter than ' Tis sweet at first t ' acquire after this process To give her the avaunt it is a pity Would move a monster Hearts of most hard temper Melt and lament for her O God 's will much better She ne'er had known pomp though't be temporal Yet if that quarrel fortune do divorce It from the bearer ' tis a sufferance panging As soul and body 's severing Alas poor lady She 's a stranger now again So much the more Must pity drop upon her Verily I swear ' tis better to be lowly born And range with humble livers in content Than to be perk'd up in a glist'ring grief And wear a golden sorrow Our content Is our best having By my troth and maidenhead I would not be a queen Beshrew me I would And venture maidenhead for ' t and so would you For all this spice of your hypocrisy You that have so fair parts of

thy rare qualities sweet gentleness Thy meekness saint like wife like government Obeying in commanding and thy parts Sovereign and pious else could speak thee out- The queen of earthly queens She 's noble born And like her true nobility she has Carried herself towards me Most gracious sir In humblest manner I require your Highness That it shall please you to declare in hearing Of all these ears for where I am robb'd and bound There must I be unloos'd although not there At once and fully satisfied whether ever I Did broach this business to your Highness or Laid any scruple in your way which might Induce you to the question on't or ever Have to you but with thanks to God for such A royal lady spake one the least word that might Be to the prejudice of her present state Or touch of her good person My Lord Cardinal I do excuse you yea upon mine honour I free you from't You are not to be taught That you have many enemies that know not Why they are so but like to village curs Bark when their fellows do By some of these The Queen is put in anger Y'are excus'd But will you be more justified You ever Have wish'd the sleeping of this business never desir'd It to be stirr'd but oft have hind'red oft The passages made toward it On my honour I speak my good Lord Cardinal to this point And thus far clear him Now what mov'd me to't I will be bold with time and your attention Then mark th ' inducement Thus it came give heed to't My conscience first receiv'd a tenderness Scruple and prick on certain speeches utter'd By th ' Bishop of Bayonne then French ambassador Who had been hither sent on the debating A marriage ' twixt the Duke of Orleans and Our daughter Mary I ' th ' progress of this business Ere a determinate resolution he- I mean the Bishop did require a respite Wherein he might the King his lord advertise Whether our daughter were legitimate Respecting this our marriage with the dowager Sometimes our brother 's wife This respite shook The bosom of my conscience enter'd me Yea with a splitting power and made to tremble The region of my breast which forc'd such way That many maz'd considerings did throng And press'd in with this caution First methought I stood not in the smile of heaven who had Commanded nature that my lady 's womb If it conceiv'd a male child by me should Do no more offices of life to't than The grave does to the dead for her male issue Or died where they were made or shortly after This world had air'd them Hence I took a thought This was a judgment on me that my kingdom Well worthy the best heir o ' th ' world should not Be gladded in't by me Then follows that I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in By this my issue 's fail and that gave to me Many a groaning throe Thus hulling in The wild sea of my conscience I did steer Toward this remedy whereupon we are Now present here together that 's to say I meant to rectify my conscience which I then did feel full sick and yet not well By all the reverend fathers of the land And doctors learn'd First I began in private With you my Lord of Lincoln you remember How under my oppression I did reek When I first mov'd you Very well my liege I have spoke long be pleas'd yourself to say How far you satisfied me So please your Highness The question did at first so stagger me- Bearing a state of mighty moment in't And consequence of dread that I committed The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt And did entreat your Highness to this course Which you are running here I then mov'd you My Lord of Canterbury and got your leave To make this present summons Unsolicited I left no reverend person in this court But by particular consent proceeded Under your hands and seals therefore go on For no dislike i ' th ' world against the person Of the good Queen but the sharp thorny points Of my alleged reasons drives this forward Prove but our marriage lawful by my life And kingly dignity we are contented To wear our moral state to come with her Katharine our queen before the primest creature That 's paragon'd o ' th ' world So please your Highness The Queen being absent ' tis a needful fitness That we adjourn this court till further day Meanwhile must be an earnest motion Made to the Queen to call back her appeal She intends unto his Holiness Aside I may perceive These cardinals trifle with me I abhor This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome My learn'd and well beloved servant Cranmer Prithee return With thy approach I know My comfort comes along -Break up the court I say set on Exuent in manner as they entered Take thy lute wench My soul grows How now An't please your Grace the two great Cardinals Wait in the presence Would they speak with me They will'd me say so madam Pray their Graces To come near Exit GENTLEMAN What can be their business With me a poor weak woman fall'n from favour I do not like their coming Now I think on't They should be good men their affairs as righteous But all hoods make not monks Peace to your Highness Your Graces find me here part of housewife I would be all against the worst may happen What are your pleasures with me reverend lords May it please you noble madam to withdraw Into your private chamber we shall give you The full cause of our coming Speak it here There 's nothing I have done yet o ' my conscience Deserves a corner Would all other women Could speak this with as free a soul as I do My lords I care not so much I am happy Above a number if my actions Were tried by ev'ry tongue ev'ry eye saw 'em Envy and base opinion set against 'em I know my life so even If your business Seek me out and that way I am wife in Out with it boldly truth loves open dealing Tanta est erga te mentis integritas regina serenis sima- O good my lord no Latin I am not such a truant since my coming As not to know the language I have liv'd in A strange tongue makes my cause more strange suspicious Pray speak in English Here are some will thank you If you speak truth for their poor mistress ' sake Believe me she has had much wrong Lord Cardinal The willing'st sin I ever yet committed May be absolv'd in English Noble lady I am sorry my integrity should breed And service to his Majesty and you So deep suspicion where all faith was meant We come not by the way of accusation To taint that honour every good tongue blesses Nor to betray you any way to sorrow- You have too much good lady but to know How you stand minded in the weighty difference Between the King and you and to deliver Like free and honest men our just opinions And comforts to your cause Most honour'd madam My Lord of York out of his noble nature Zeal and obedience he still bore your Grace Forgetting like a good man your late censure Both of his truth and him which was too far- Offers as I do in a sign of peace His service and his counsel Aside To betray me.- My lords I thank you both for your good wins Ye speak like honest men pray God ye prove so But how to make ye suddenly an answer In such a point of weight so near mine honour More near my life I fear with my weak wit And to such men of gravity and learning In truth I know not I was set at work Among my maids full little God knows looking Either for such men or such business For her sake that I have been for I feel The last fit of my greatness good your Graces Let me have time and counsel for my cause Alas I am a woman friendless hopeless Madam you wrong the King 's love with these fears Your hopes and friends are infinite In England But little for my profit can you think lords That any Englishman dare give me counsel Or be a known friend ' gainst his Highness ' pleasure- Though he be grown so desperate to be honest- And live a subject Nay forsooth my friends They that must weigh out my afflictions They that my trust must grow to live not here They are as all my other comforts far hence In mine own country lords I would your Grace Would leave your griefs and take my counsel How sir Put your main cause into the King 's protection He 's loving and most gracious ' Twill be much Both for your honour better and your cause For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye You 'll part away disgrac'd He tells you rightly Ye tell me what ye wish for both my ruin Is this your Christian counsel Out upon ye Heaven is above all yet there sits a Judge That no king can corrupt Your rage mistakes us The more shame for ye holy men I thought ye Upon my soul two reverend cardinal virtues But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye Mend 'em for shame my lords Is this your comfort The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady- A woman lost among ye laugh'd at scorn'd I will not wish ye half my miseries I have more charity but say I warned ye Take heed for heaven 's sake take heed lest at once The burden of my sorrows fall upon ye Madam this is a mere distraction You turn the good we offer into envy Ye turn me into nothing Woe upon ye And all such false professors Would you have me- If you have any justice any pity If ye be any thing but churchmen 's habits- Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me Alas has banish'd me his bed already His love too long ago I am old my lords And all the fellowship I hold now with him Is only my obedience What can happen To me above this wretchedness All your studies Make me a curse like this Your fears are worse Have I liv'd thus long let me speak myself Since virtue finds no friends a wife a true one A woman I dare say without vain glory Never yet branded with suspicion Have I with all my full affections Still met the King lov'd him next heav'n obey'd him Been out of fondness superstitious to him Almost forgot my prayers to content him And am I thus rewarded ' Tis not well lords Bring me a constant woman to her husband One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure And to that woman when she has done most Yet will I add an honour a great patience Madam you wander from the good we aim at My lord I dare not make myself so guilty To give up willingly that noble title Your master we d me to nothing but death Shall e'er divorce my dignities Pray hear me Would I had never trod this English earth Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it Ye have angels ' faces but heaven knows your hearts What will become of me now wretched lady I am the most unhappy woman living To her WOMEN Alas poor wenches where are now If your Grace Could but be brought to know our ends are honest You 'd feel more comfort Why should we good lady Upon what cause wrong you Alas our places The way of our profession is against it We are to cure such sorrows not to sow 'em For goodness ' sake consider what you do How you may hurt yourself ay utterly Grow from the King 's acquaintance by this carriage The hearts of princes kiss obedience So much they love it but to stubborn spirits They swell and grow as terrible as storms I know you have a gentle noble temper A soul as even as a calm Pray think us Those we profess peace makers friends and servants Madam you 'll find it so You wrong your virtues With these weak women 's fears A noble spirit As yours was put into you ever casts Such doubts as false coin from it The King loves you Beware you lose it not For us if you please To trust us in your business we are ready To use our utmost studies in your service Do what ye will my lords and pray If you will now unite in your complaints And force them with a constancy the Cardinal Can not stand under them if you omit The offer of this time I can not promise But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces With these you bear already I am joyful To meet the least occasion that may give me Remembrance of my father in law the Duke To be reveng'd on him Which of the peers Have uncontemn'd gone by him or at least Strangely neglected When did he regard The stamp of nobleness in any person Out of himself My lords you speak your pleasures What he deserves of you and me I know What we can do to him though now the time Gives way to us I much fear If you can not Bar his access to th ' King never attempt Anything on him for he hath a witchcraft Over the King in 's tongue O fear him not His spell in that is out the King hath found Matter against him that for ever mars The honey of his language No he 's settled Not to come off in his displeasure Sir I should be glad to hear such news as this Once every hour Believe it this is true In the divorce his contrary proceedings Are all unfolded wherein he appears As I would wish mine enemy How came His practices to light Most Strangely O how how The Cardinal 's letters to the Pope miscarried And came to th ' eye o ' th ' King wherein was read How that the Cardinal did entreat his Holiness To stay the judgment o ' th ' divorce for if It did take place ' I do ' quoth he ' perceive My king is tangled in affection to A creature of the Queen 's Lady Anne Bullen ' Has the King this Believe it Will this work The King in this perceives him how he coasts And hedges his own way But in this point All his tricks founder and he brings his physic After his patient 's death the King already Hath married the fair lady Would he had May you be happy in your wish my lord For I profess you have it Now all my joy Trace the conjunction My amen to't An men 's There 's order given for her coronation Marry this is yet but young and may be left To some ears unrecounted But my lords She is a gallant creature and complete In mind and feature I persuade me from her Will fall some blessing to this land which shall In it be memoriz'd But will the King Digest this letter of the Cardinal 's The Lord forbid Marry amen No no There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose Will make this sting the sooner Cardinal Campeius Is stol'n away to Rome hath ta'en no leave Has left the cause o ' th ' King unhandled and Is posted as the agent of our Cardinal To second all his plot I do assure you The King cried ' Ha ' at this Now God incense him And let him cry ' Ha ' louder But my lord When returns Cranmer He is return'd in his opinions which Have satisfied the King for his divorce Together with all famous colleges Almost in Christendom Shortly I believe His second marriage shall be publish'd and Her coronation Katharine no more Shall be call'd queen but princess dowager And widow to Prince Arthur This same Cranmer 's A worthy fellow and hath ta'en much pain In the King 's business He has and we shall see him For it an archbishop So I hear ' Tis so Observe observe he 's moody The packet Cromwell Gave't you the King To his own hand in 's bedchamber Look'd he o ' th ' inside of the paper Presently He did unseal them and the first he view'd He did it with a serious mind a heed Was in his countenance You he bade Attend him here this morning Is he ready To come abroad I think by this he is Leave me awhile Exit CROMWELL Aside It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon The French King 's sister he shall marry her Anne Bullen No I 'll no Anne Bullens for him There 's more in't than fair visage Bullen No we 'll no Bullens Speedily I wish To hear from Rome The Marchioness of Pembroke He 's discontented May be he hears the King Does whet his anger to him Sharp enough Lord for thy justice Aside The late Queen 's gentlewoman a knight 's He is vex'd at something I would ' twere something that would fret the string The master cord on 's heart The King the King What piles of wealth hath he accumulated To his own portion And what expense by th ' hour Seems to flow from him How i ' th ' name of thrift Does he rake this together?-Now my lords Saw you the Cardinal My lord we have Stood here observing him Some strange commotion Is in his brain he bites his lip and starts Stops on a sudden looks upon the ground Then lays his finger on his temple straight Springs out into fast gait then stops again Strikes his breast hard and anon he casts His eye against the moon In most strange postures We have seen him set himself It may well be There is a mutiny in 's mind This morning Papers of state he sent me to peruse As I requir'd and wot you what I found There on my conscience put unwittingly Forsooth an inventory thus importing The several parcels of his plate his treasure Rich stuffs and ornaments of household which I find at such proud rate that it outspeaks Possession of a subject It 's heaven 's will Some spirit put this paper in the packet To bless your eye withal If we did think His contemplation were above the earth And fix'd on spiritual object he should still dwell in his musings but I am afraid His thinkings are below the moon not worth His serious considering Heaven forgive me Ever God bless your Highness Good my lord You are full of heavenly stuff and bear the inventory Of your best graces in your mind the which You were now running o'er You have scarce time To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span To keep your earthly audit sure in that I deem you an ill husband and am glad To have you therein my companion Sir For holy offices I have a time a time To think upon the part of business which I bear i ' th ' state and nature does require Her times of preservation which perforce I her frail son amongst my brethren mortal Must give my tendance to You have said well And ever may your Highness yoke together As I will lend you cause my doing well With my well saying ' Tis well said again And ' tis a kind of good deed to say well And yet words are no deeds My father lov'd you He said he did and with his deed did crown His word upon you Since I had my office I have kept you next my heart have not alone Employ'd you where high profits might come home But par'd my present havings to bestow My bounties upon you Aside What should this mean Aside The Lord increase this business Have I not made you The prime man of the state I pray you tell me If what I now pronounce you have found true And if you may confess it say withal If you are bound to us or no What say you My sovereign I confess your royal graces Show'r'd on me daily have been more than could My studied purposes requite which went Beyond all man 's endeavours My endeavours Have ever come too short of my desires Yet fil'd with my abilities mine own ends Have been mine so that evermore they pointed To th ' good of your most sacred person and The profit of the state For your great graces Heap'd upon me poor undeserver I Can nothing render but allegiant thanks My pray'rs to heaven for you my loyalty Which ever has and ever shall be growing Till death that winter kill it Fairly answer'd A loyal and obedient subject is Therein illustrated the honour of it Does pay the act of it as i ' th ' contrary The foulness is the punishment I presume That as my hand has open'd bounty to you My heart dropp'd love my pow'r rain'd honour more On you than any so your hand and heart Your brain and every function of your power Should notwithstanding that your bond of duty As ' twere in love 's particular be more To me your friend than any I do profess That for your Highness ' good I ever labour'd More than mine own that am have and will be- Though all the world should crack their duty to you And throw it from their soul though perils did Abound as thick as thought could make 'em and Appear in forms more horrid yet my duty As doth a rock against the chiding flood Should the approach of this wild river break And stand unshaken yours ' Tis nobly spoken Take notice lords he has a loyal breast For you have seen him open ' t. Read o'er this What should this mean What sudden anger 's this How have I reap'd it He parted frowning from me as if ruin Leap'd from his eyes so looks the chafed lion Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him- Then makes him nothing I must read this paper I fear the story of his anger ' Tis so This paper has undone me ' Tis th ' account Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together For mine own ends indeed to gain the popedom And fee my friends in Rome O negligence Fit for a fool to fall by What cross devil Made me put this main secret in the packet I sent the King Is there no way to cure this No new device to beat this from his brains I know ' twill stir him strongly yet I know A way if it take right in spite of fortune Will bring me off again What 's this ' To th ' Pope ' The letter as I live with all the business I writ to 's Holiness Nay then farewell I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness And from that full meridian of my glory I haste now to my setting I shall fall Like a bright exhalation in the evening And no man see me more Hear the King 's pleasure Cardinal who commands you To render up the great seal presently Into our hands and to confine yourself To Asher House my Lord of Winchester 's Till you hear further from his Highness Stay Where 's your commission lords Words can not carry Authority so weighty Who dares cross 'em Bearing the King 's will from his mouth expressly Till I find more than will or words to do it- I mean your malice know officious lords I dare and must deny it Now I feel Of what coarse metal ye are moulded envy How eagerly ye follow my disgraces As if it fed ye and how sleek and wanton Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin Follow your envious courses men of malice You have Christian warrant for 'em and no doubt In time will find their fit rewards That seal You ask with such a violence the King- Mine and your master with his own hand gave me Bade me enjoy it with the place and honours During my life and to confirm his goodness Tied it by letters patents Now who 'll take it The King that gave it It must be himself then Thou art a proud traitor priest Proud lord thou liest Within these forty hours Surrey durst better Have burnt that tongue than said so Thy ambition Thou scarlet sin robb'd this bewailing land Of noble Buckingham my father in law The heads of all thy brother cardinals With thee and all thy best parts bound together Weigh'd not a hair of his Plague of your policy You sent me deputy for Ireland Far from his succour from the King from all That might have mercy on the fault thou gav'st him Whilst your great goodness out of holy pity Absolv'd him with an axe This and all else This talking lord can lay upon my credit I answer is most false The Duke by law Found his deserts how innocent I was From any private malice in his end His noble jury and foul cause can witness If I lov'd many words lord I should tell you You have as little honesty as honour That in the way of loyalty and truth Toward the King my ever royal master Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be And an that love his follies By my soul Your long coat priest protects you thou shouldst feel My sword i ' the life blood of thee else My lords Can ye endure to hear this arrogance And from this fellow If we live thus tamely To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet Farewell nobility Let his Grace go forward And dare us with his cap like larks All goodness Is poison to thy stomach Yes that goodness Of gleaning all the land 's wealth into one Into your own hands Cardinal by extortion The goodness of your intercepted packets You writ to th ' Pope against the King your goodness Since you provoke me shall be most notorious My Lord of Norfolk as you are truly noble As you respect the common good the state Of our despis'd nobility our issues Whom if he live will scarce be gentlemen- Produce the grand sum of his sins the articles Collected from his life I 'll startle you Worse than the sacring bell when the brown wench Lay kissing in your arms Lord Cardinal How much methinks I could despise this man But that I am bound in charity against it Those articles my lord are in the King 's hand But thus much they are foul ones So much fairer And spotless shall mine innocence arise When the King knows my truth This can not save you I thank my memory I yet remember Some of these articles and out they shall Now if you can blush and cry guilty Cardinal You 'll show a little honesty Speak on sir I dare your worst objections If I blush It is to see a nobleman want manners I had rather want those than my head Have at you First that without the King 's assent or knowledge You wrought to be a legate by which power You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops Then that in all you writ to Rome or else To foreign princes ' Ego et Rex meus ' Was still inscrib'd in which you brought the King To be your servant Then that without the knowledge Either of King or Council when you went Ambassador to the Emperor you made bold To carry into Flanders the great seal Item you sent a large commission To Gregory de Cassado to conclude Without the King 's will or the state 's allowance A league between his Highness and Ferrara That out of mere ambition you have caus'd Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the King 's coin Then that you have sent innumerable substance By what means got I leave to your own conscience To furnish Rome and to prepare the ways You have for dignities to the mere undoing Of all the kingdom Many more there are Which since they are of you and odious I will not taint my mouth with O my lord Press not a falling man too far ' Tis virtue His faults lie open to the laws let them Not you correct him My heart weeps to see him So little of his great self I forgive him Lord Cardinal the King 's further pleasure is- Because all those things you have done of late By your power legatine within this kingdom Fall into th ' compass of a praemunire- That therefore such a writ be sued against you To forfeit all your goods lands tenements Chattels and whatsoever and to be Out of the King 's protection This is my charge And so we 'll leave you to your meditations How to live better For your stubborn answer About the giving back the great seal to us The King shall know it and no doubt shall thank you So fare you well my little good Lord Cardinal So farewell to the little good you bear me Farewell a long farewell to all my greatness This is the state of man to day he puts forth The tender leaves of hopes to morrow blossoms And bears his blushing honours thick upon him The third day comes a frost a killing frost And when he thinks good easy man full surely His greatness is a ripening nips his root And then he falls as I do I have ventur'd Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders This many summers in a sea of glory But far beyond my depth My high blown pride At length broke under me and now has left me Weary and old with service to the mercy Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me Vain pomp and glory of this world I hate ye I feel my heart new open'd O how wretched Is that poor man that hangs on princes ' favours There is betwixt that smile we would aspire to That sweet aspect of princes and their ruin More pangs and fears than wars or women have And when he falls he falls like Lucifer Never to hope again I have no power to speak sir What amaz'd At my misfortunes Can thy spirit wonder A great man should decline Nay an you weep I am fall'n indeed How does your Grace Why well Never so truly happy my good Cromwell I know myself now and I feel within me A peace above all earthly dignities A still and quiet conscience The King has cur'd me I humbly thank his Grace and from these shoulders These ruin'd pillars out of pity taken A load would sink a navy too much honour O ' tis a burden Cromwell ' tis a burden Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven I am glad your Grace has made that right use of it I hope I have I am able now methinks Out of a fortitude of soul I feel To endure more miseries and greater far Than my weak hearted enemies dare offer What news abroad The heaviest and the worst Is your displeasure with the King God bless him The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen Lord Chancellor in your place That 's somewhat sudden But he 's a learned man May he continue Long in his Highness ' favour and do justice For truth 's sake and his conscience that his bones When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings May have a tomb of orphans ' tears wept on him What more That Cranmer is return'd with welcome Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury That 's news indeed Last that the Lady Anne Whom the King hath in secrecy long married This day was view'd in open as his queen Going to chapel and the voice is now Only about her coronation There was the weight that pull'd me down O my lord Must I then leave you Must I needs forgo So good so noble and so true a master Bear witness all that have not hearts of iron With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord The King shall have my service but my prayers For ever and for ever shall be yours Cromwell I did not think to shed a tear In all my miseries but thou hast forc'd me Out of thy honest truth to play the woman Let 's dry our eyes and thus far hear me Cromwell And when I am forgotten as I shall be And sleep in dull cold marble where no mention Of me more must be heard of say I taught thee- Say Wolsey that once trod the ways of glory And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in- A sure and safe one though thy master miss'd it Mark but my fall and that that ruin'd me Cromwell I charge thee fling away ambition By that sin fell the angels How can man then The image of his Maker hope to win by it Love thyself last cherish those hearts that hate thee Corruption wins not more than honesty Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace To silence envious tongues Be just and fear not Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country 's Thy God 's and truth 's then if thou fall'st O Cromwell Thou fall'st a blessed martyr Serve the King and prithee lead me in There take an inventory of all I have To the last penny ' tis the King 's My robe And my integrity to heaven is all I dare now call mine own O Cromwell Cromwell Had I but serv'd my God with half the zeal I serv'd my King he would not in mine age Have left me naked to mine enemies Good sir have patience So I have Farewell The hopes of court My hopes in heaven do dwell Exeunt Y'are well met once again So are you You come to take your stand here and ' Tis all my business At our last encounter The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial ' Tis very true But that time offer'd ' Tis well The citizens I am sure have shown at full their royal minds- As let 'em have their rights they are ever forward- In celebration of this day with shows Pageants and sights of honour Never greater Nor I 'll assure you better taken sir May I be bold to ask what that contains That paper in your hand Yes ' tis the list Of those that claim their offices this day By custom of the coronation The Duke of Suffolk is the first and claims To be High Steward next the Duke of Norfolk He to be Earl Marshal You may read the rest I thank you sir had I not known That I can tell you too The Archbishop Of Canterbury accompanied with other Learned and reverend fathers of his order Held a late court at Dunstable six miles of From Ampthill where the Princess lay to which She was often cited by them but appear'd not And to be short for not appearance and The King 's late scruple by the main assent Of all these learned men she was divorc'd And the late marriage made of none effect Since which she was removed to Kimbolton Where she remains now sick Alas good lady Trumpets The trumpets sound Stand close the Queen is coming A royal train believe me These know Who 's that that bears the sceptre Marquis Dorset And that the Earl of Surrey with the rod A bold brave gentleman That should be The Duke of Suffolk ' Tis the same High Steward And that my Lord of Norfolk Yes Looking on the QUEEN Heaven They that bear The cloth of honour over her are four barons Of the Cinque ports Those men are happy and so are all It is and all the rest are countesses Their coronets say so These are stars indeed And sometimes falling ones No more of that Among the crowds i ' th ' Abbey where a finger Could not be wedg'd in more I am stifled With the mere rankness of their joy You saw The ceremony That I did How was it Well worth the seeing Good sir speak it to us As well as I am able The rich stream Of lords and ladies having brought the Queen To a prepar'd place in the choir fell of A distance from her while her Grace sat down To rest awhile some half an hour or so In a rich chair of state opposing freely The beauty of her person to the people Believe me sir she is the goodliest woman That ever lay by man which when the people Had the full view of such a noise arose As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest As loud and to as many tunes hats cloaks- Doublets I think flew up and had their faces Been loose this day they had been lost Such joy I never saw before Great bellied women That had not half a week to go like rams In the old time of war would shake the press And make 'em reel before 'em No man living Could say ' This is my wife ' there all were woven So strangely in one piece But what follow'd At length her Grace rose and with Sir You must no more call it York Place that 's past For since the Cardinal fell that title 's lost ' Tis now the King 's and called Whitehall I know it But ' tis so lately alter'd that the old name Is fresh about me What two reverend bishops Were those that went on each side of the Queen Stokesly and Gardiner the one of Winchester Newly preferr'd from the King 's secretary The other London He of Winchester Is held no great good lover of the Archbishop 's The virtuous Cranmer All the land knows that However yet there is no great breach When it comes Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him Who may that be I pray you Thomas Cromwell A man in much esteem with th ' King and truly A worthy friend The King has made him Master O ' th ' jewel House And one already of the Privy Council He will deserve more Yes without all doubt Come gentlemen ye shall go my way which Is to th ' court and there ye shall be my guests Something I can command As I walk thither I 'll tell ye more You may command us sir Exeunt How does your Grace O Griffith sick to death My legs like loaden branches bow to th ' earth Willing to leave their burden Reach a chair So now methinks I feel a little ease Didst thou not tell me Griffith as thou led'st me That the great child of honour Cardinal Wolsey Was dead Yes madam but I think your Grace Out of the pain you suffer'd gave no ear to't Prithee good Griffith tell me how he died If well he stepp'd before me happily For my example Well the voice goes madam For after the stout Earl Northumberland Arrested him at York and brought him forward As a man sorely tainted to his answer He fell sick suddenly and grew so ill He could not sit his mule Alas poor man At last with easy roads he came to Leicester Lodg'd in the abbey where the reverend abbot With all his covent honourably receiv'd him To whom he gave these words ' O father Abbot An old man broken with the storms of state Is come to lay his weary bones among ye Give him a little earth for charity ' So went to bed where eagerly his sickness Pursu'd him still And three nights after this About the hour of eight which he himself Foretold should be his last full of repentance Continual meditations tears and sorrows He gave his honours to the world again His blessed part to heaven and slept in peace So may he rest his faults lie gently on him Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him And yet with charity He was a man Of an unbounded stomach ever ranking Himself with princes one that by suggestion Tied all the kingdom Simony was fair play His own opinion was his law I ' th ' presence He would say untruths and be ever double Both in his words and meaning He was never But where he meant to ruin pitiful His promises were as he then was mighty But his performance as he is now nothing Of his own body he was ill and gave The clergy ill example Noble madam Men 's evil manners live in brass their virtues We write in water May it please your Highness To hear me speak his good now Yes good Griffith I were malicious else This Cardinal Though from an humble stock undoubtedly Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle He was a scholar and a ripe and good one Exceeding wise fair spoken and persuading Lofty and sour to them that lov'd him not But to those men that sought him sweet as summer And though he were unsatisfied in getting- Which was a sin yet in bestowing madam He was most princely ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he rais'd in you Ipswich and Oxford One of which fell with him Unwilling to outlive the good that did it The other though unfinish'd yet so famous So excellent in art and still so rising That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him For then and not till then he felt himself And found the blessedness of being little And to add greater honours to his age Than man could give him he died fearing God After my death I wish no other herald No other speaker of my living actions To keep mine honour from corruption But such an honest chronicler as Griffith Whom I most hated living thou hast made me With thy religious truth and modesty Now in his ashes honour Peace be with him patience be near me still and set me lower I have not long to trouble thee Good Griffith Cause the musicians play me that sad note I nam'd my knell whilst I sit meditating On that celestial harmony I go to She is asleep Good wench let 's sit down quiet For fear we wake her Softly gentle Patience Spirits of peace where are ye Are ye all gone And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye Madam we are here It is not you I call for Saw ye none enter since I slept None madam No Saw you not even now a blessed troop Invite me to a banquet whose bright faces Cast thousand beams upon me like the sun They promis'd me eternal happiness And brought me garlands Griffith which I feel I am not worthy yet to wear I shall assuredly I am most joyful madam such good dreams Possess your fancy Bid the music leave They are harsh and heavy to me Music ceases Do you note How much her Grace is alter'd on the sudden How long her face is drawn How pale she looks And of an earthly cold Mark her eyes She is going wench Pray pray Heaven comfort her An't like your Grace- You are a saucy fellow Deserve we no more reverence You are to blame Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness To use so rude behaviour Go to kneel I humbly do entreat your Highness ' pardon My haste made me unmannerly There is staying A gentleman sent from the King to see you Admit him entrance Griffith but this fellow Let me ne'er see again Exit MESSENGER Madam the same your servant O my Lord The times and titles now are alter'd strangely With me since first you knew me But I pray you What is your pleasure with me Noble lady First mine own service to your Grace the next The King 's request that I would visit you Who grieves much for your weakness and by me Sends you his princely commendations And heartily entreats you take good comfort O my good lord that comfort comes too late ' Tis like a pardon after execution That gentle physic given in time had cur'd me But now I am past all comforts here but prayers How does his Highness Madam in good health So may he ever do and ever flourish When I shall dwell with worms and my poor name Banish'd the kingdom Patience is that letter I caus'd you write yet sent away No madam Giving it to KATHARINE Sir I most humbly pray you to deliver This to my lord the King Most willing madam In which I have commended to his goodness The model of our chaste loves his young daughter- The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!- Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding- She is young and of a noble modest nature I hope she will deserve well and a little To love her for her mother 's sake that lov'd him Heaven knows how dearly My next poor petition Is that his noble Grace would have some pity Upon my wretched women that so long Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully Of which there is not one I dare avow- And now I should not lie but will deserve For virtue and true beauty of the soul For honesty and decent carriage A right good husband let him be a noble And sure those men are happy that shall have 'em The last is for my men they are the poorest But poverty could never draw 'em from me- That they may have their wages duly paid 'em And something over to remember me by If heaven had pleas'd to have given me longer life And able means we had not parted thus These are the whole contents and good my lord By that you love the dearest in this world As you wish Christian peace to souls departed Stand these poor people 's friend and urge the King To do me this last right By heaven I will Or let me lose the fashion of a man I thank you honest lord Remember me In all humility unto his Highness Say his long trouble now is passing Out of this world Tell him in death I bless'd him For so I will Mine eyes grow dim Farewell My lord Griffith farewell Nay Patience You must not leave me yet I must to bed Call in more women When I am dead good wench Let me be us'd with honour strew me over With maiden flowers that all the world may know I was a chaste wife to my grave Embalm me Then lay me forth although unqueen'd yet like A queen and daughter to a king inter me I can no more Exeunt leading KATHARINE It 's one o'clock boy is't not It hath struck These should be hours for necessities Not for delights times to repair our nature With comforting repose and not for us To waste these times Good hour of night Sir Thomas Whither so late Came you from the King my lord I did Sir Thomas and left him at primero With the Duke of Suffolk I must to him too Before he go to bed I 'll take my leave Not yet Sir Thomas Lovell What 's the matter It seems you are in haste An if there be No great offence belongs to't give your friend Some touch of your late business Affairs

this work The Queen 's in labour They say in great extremity and fear'd She 'll with the labour end The fruit she goes with I pray for heartily that it may find Good time and live but for the stock Sir Thomas I wish it grubb'd up now Methinks I could Cry thee amen and yet my conscience says She 's a good creature and sweet lady does Deserve our better wishes But sir sir- Hear me Sir Thomas Y'are

myself have ventur'd To speak my mind of him and indeed this day Sir I may tell it you I think I have Incens'd the lords o ' th ' Council that he is- For so I know he is they know he is- A most arch heretic a pestilence That does infect the land with which they moved Have broken with the King who hath so far Given ear to our complaint of his great grace And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs Our reasons laid before him hath commanded To morrow morning to the Council board He be convented He 's a rank weed Sir Thomas And we must root him out From your affairs I hinder you too

is a piece of malice I am glad I came this way so happily the King Shall understand it presently Exit Aside ' Tis Butts The King 's physician as he pass'd along How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me Pray heaven he sound not my disgrace For certain This is of purpose laid by some that hate me- God turn their hearts I never sought their malice- To quench mine honour they would shame to make me Wait

your Highness saw this many a day Body a me where is it There my lord The high promotion of his Grace of Canterbury Who holds his state at door ' mongst pursuivants Pages and footboys Ha ' tis he indeed Is this the honour they do one another ' Tis well there 's one above 'em yet I had thought They had parted so much honesty among ' em- At least good manners as not thus to suffer A man of his place and so near our favour To dance attendance on their lordships ' pleasures And at the door too like a post with packets By holy Mary Butts there 's knavery Let 'em alone and draw the curtain close We shall hear more anon Exeunt Speak to the business master secretary Why are we met in council Please your honours The chief cause concerns his Grace of Canterbury Has he had knowledge of it Yes Who waits there Without my noble lords Yes My Lord Archbishop And has done half an hour to know your pleasures Let him come in Your Grace may enter now My good Lord Archbishop I am very sorry To sit here at this present and behold That chair stand empty but we all are men In our own natures frail and capable Of our flesh few are angels out of which frailty And want of wisdom you that best should teach us Have misdemean'd yourself and not a little Toward the King first then his laws in filling The whole realm by your teaching and your chaplains- For so we are inform'd with new opinions Divers and dangerous which are heresies And not reform'd may prove pernicious Which reformation must be sudden too My noble lords for those that tame wild horses Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle But stop their mouth with stubborn bits and spur 'em Till they obey the manage If we suffer Out of our easiness and childish pity To one man 's honour this contagious sickness Farewell all physic and what follows then Commotions uproars with a general taint Of the whole state as of late days our neighbours The upper Germany can dearly witness Yet freshly pitied in our memories My good lords hitherto in all the progress Both of my life and office I have labour'd And with no little study that my teaching And the strong course of my authority Might go one way and safely and the end Was ever to do well Nor is there living- I speak it with a single heart my lords- A man that more detests more stirs against Both in his private conscience and his place Defacers of a public peace than I do Pray heaven the King may never find a heart With less allegiance in it Men that make Envy and crooked malice nourishment Dare bite the best I do beseech your lordships That in this case of justice my accusers Be what they will may stand forth face to face And freely urge against me Nay my lord That can not be you are a councillor And by that virtue no man dare accuse you My lord because we have business of more moment We will be short with you ' Tis his Highness ' pleasure And our consent for better trial of you From hence you be committed to the Tower Where being but a private man again You shall know many dare accuse you boldly More than I fear you are provided for Ah my good Lord of Winchester I thank you You are always my good friend if your will pass I shall both find your lordship judge and juror You are so merciful I see your end- ' Tis my undoing Love and meekness lord Become a churchman better than ambition Win straying souls with modesty again Cast none away That I shall clear myself Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience I make as little doubt as you do conscience In doing daily wrongs I could say more But reverence to your calling makes me modest My lord my lord you are a sectary That 's the plain truth Your painted gloss discovers To men that understand you words and weakness My Lord of Winchester y'are a little By your good favour too sharp men so noble However faulty yet should find respect For what they have been ' tis a cruelty To load a falling man Good Master Secretary I cry your honour mercy you may worst Of all this table say so Why my lord Do not I know you for a favourer Of this new sect Ye are not sound Not sound Not sound I say Would you were half so honest Men 's prayers then would seek you not their fears I shall remember this bold language Do Remember your bold life too This is too much Forbear for shame my lords I have done And I. Then thus for you my lord it stands agreed I take it by all voices that forthwith You be convey'd to th ' Tower a prisoner There to remain till the King 's further pleasure Be known unto us Are you all agreed lords We are Is there no other way of mercy But I must needs to th ' Tower my lords What other Would you expect You are strangely troublesome Let some o ' th ' guard be ready there For me Must I go like a traitor thither Receive him And see him safe i ' th ' Tower Stay good my lords I have a little yet to say Look there my lords By virtue of that ring I take my cause Out of the gripes of cruel men and give it To a most noble judge the King my master This is the King 's ring ' Tis no counterfeit ' Tis the right ring by heav'n I told ye all When we first put this dangerous stone a rolling ' Twould fall upon ourselves Do you think my lords The King will suffer but the little finger Of this man to be vex'd ' Tis now too certain How much more is his life in value with him Would I were fairly out on't My mind gave me In seeking tales and informations Against this man whose honesty the devil And his disciples only envy at- Ye blew the fire that burns ye Now have at ye Dread sovereign how much are we bound to heaven In daily thanks that gave us such a prince Not only good and wise but most religious One that in all obedience makes the church The chief aim of his honour and to strengthen That holy duty out of dear respect His royal self in judgment comes to hear The cause betwixt her and this great offender You were ever good at sudden commendations Bishop of Winchester But know I come not To hear such flattery now and in my presence They are too thin and bare to hide offences To me you can not reach you play the spaniel And think with wagging of your tongue to win me But whatsoe'er thou tak'st me for I 'm sure Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody To CRANMER Good man sit down Now let me see the proudest He that dares most but wag his finger at thee By all that 's holy he had better starve Than but once think this place becomes thee not May it please your Grace- No sir it does not please me I had thought I had had men of some understanding And wisdom of my Council but I find none Was it discretion lords to let this man This good man few of you deserve that title- This honest man wait like a lousy footboy At chamber door and one as great as you are Why what a shame was this Did my commission Bid ye so far forget yourselves I gave ye Power as he was a councillor to try him Not as a groom There 's some of ye I see More out of malice than integrity Would try him to the utmost had ye mean Which ye shall never have while I live Thus far My most dread sovereign may it like your Grace To let my tongue excuse all What was purpos'd concerning his imprisonment was rather- If there be faith in men meant for his trial And fair purgation to the world than malice I 'm sure in me Well well my lords respect him Take him and use him well he 's worthy of it I will say thus much for him if a prince May be beholding to a subject Am for his love and service so to him Make me no more ado but all embrace him Be friends for shame my lords My Lord of Canterbury I have a suit which you must not deny me That is a fair young maid that yet wants baptism You must be godfather and answer for her The greatest monarch now alive may glory In such an honour how may I deserve it That am a poor and humble subject to you Come come my lord you 'd spare your spoons You With a true heart And brother love I do it And let heaven Witness how dear I hold this confirmation Good man those joyful tears show thy true heart The common voice I see is verified Of thee which says thus ' Do my Lord of Canterbury A shrewd turn and he 's your friend for ever ' Come lords we trifle time away I long To have this young one made a Christian As I have made ye one lords one remain So I grow stronger you more honour gain Exeunt You 'll leave your noise anon ye rascals Do you take the court for Paris garden Ye rude slaves leave your gaping Within Good master porter I belong to th ' larder Belong to th ' gallows and be hang'd ye rogue Is this a place to roar in Fetch me a dozen crab tree staves and strong ones these are but switches to 'em I 'll scratch your heads You must be seeing christenings Do you look for ale and cakes here you rude rascals Pray sir be patient ' tis as much impossible Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons To scatter 'em as ' tis to make 'em sleep On May day morning which will never be We may as well push against Paul 's as stir 'em How got they in and be hang'd Alas I know not how gets the tide in As much as one sound cudgel of four foot- You see the poor remainder could distribute I made no spare sir You did nothing sir I am not Samson nor Sir Guy nor Colbrand To mow 'em down before me but if I spar'd any That had a head to hit either young or old He or she cuckold or cuckold maker Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again And that I would not for a cow God save her Within Do you hear master porter I shall be with you presently good master puppy Keep the door close sirrah What would you have me do What should you do but knock 'em down by th ' dozens Is this Moorfields to muster in Or have we some strange Indian with the great tool come to court the women so besiege us Bless me what a fry of fornication is at door On my Christian conscience this one christening will beget a thousand here will be father godfather and all together The spoons will be the bigger sir There is a fellow somewhat near the door he should be a brazier by his face for o ' my conscience twenty of the dog days now reign in 's nose all that stand about him are under the line they need no other penance That fire drake did I hit three times on the head and three times was his nose discharged against me he stands there like a mortar piece to blow us There was a haberdasher 's wife of small wit near him that rail'd upon me till her pink'd porringer fell off her head for kindling such a combustion in the state I miss'd the meteor once and hit that woman who cried out ' Clubs ' when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour which were the hope o ' th ' Strand where she was quartered They fell on I made good my place At length they came to th ' broomstaff to me I defied 'em still when suddenly a file of boys behind 'em loose shot deliver'd such a show'r of pebbles that I was fain to draw mine honour in and let 'em win the work the devil was amongst 'em I think surely These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse and fight for bitten apples that no audience but the tribulation of Tower hill or the limbs of Limehouse their dear brothers are able to endure I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum and there they are like to dance these three days besides the running banquet of two beadles that is to come Mercy o ' me what a multitude are here They grow still too from all parts they are coming As if we kept a fair here Where are these porters These lazy knaves Y'have made a fine hand fellows There 's a trim rabble let in are all these Your faithful friends o ' th ' suburbs We shall have Great store of room no doubt left for the ladies When they pass back from the christening An't please your honour We are but men and what so many may do Not being torn a pieces we have done An army can not rule 'em As I live If the King blame me for't I 'll lay ye an By th ' heels and suddenly and on your heads Clap round fines for neglect Y'are lazy knaves And here ye lie baiting of bombards when Ye should do service Hark the trumpets sound Th ' are come already from the christening Go break among the press and find a way out To let the troops pass fairly or I 'll find

you good Lord Archbishop What is her name Elizabeth Stand up lord The KING kisses the child With this kiss take my blessing God protect thee Into whose hand I give thy life Amen My noble gossips y'have been too prodigal I thank ye heartily So shall this lady When she has so much English Let me speak sir For heaven now bids me and the words I utter Let none think flattery for they 'll find 'em truth This royal infant heaven still move about her!- Though in her cradle yet now promises Upon this land a thousand blessings Which time shall bring to ripeness She shall be- But few now living can behold that goodness- A pattern to all princes living with her And all that shall succeed Saba was never More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue Than this pure soul shall be All princely graces That mould up such a mighty piece as this is With all the virtues that attend the good Shall still be doubled on her Truth shall nurse her Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her She shall be lov'd and fear'd Her own shall bless her Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn And hang their heads with sorrow Good grows with her In her days every man shall eat in safety Under his own vine what he plants and sing The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours God shall be truly known and those about her From her shall read the perfect ways of honour And by those claim their greatness not by blood Nor shall this peace sleep with her but as when The bird of wonder dies the maiden phoenix Her ashes new create another heir As great in admiration as herself So shall she leave her blessedness to one- When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness- Who from the sacred ashes of her honour Shall star like rise as great in fame as she was And so stand fix'd Peace plenty love truth terror That were the servants to this chosen infant Shall then be his and like a vine grow to him Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine His honour and the greatness of his name Shall be and make new nations he shall flourish And like a mountain cedar reach his branches To all the plains about him our children 's children Shall see this and bless heaven Thou speakest wonders She shall be to the happiness of England An aged princess many days shall see her And yet no day without a deed to crown it Would I had known no more But she must die- She must the saints must have her yet a virgin A most unspotted lily shall she pass To th ' ground and all the world shall mourn her O Lord Archbishop Thou hast made me now a man never before This happy child did I get anything This oracle of comfort has so pleas'd me That when I am in heaven I shall desire To see what this child does and praise my Maker I thank ye all To you my good Lord Mayor And you good brethren I am much beholding I have receiv'd much honour by your presence And ye shall find me thankful Lead the way lords Ye must all see the Queen and she must thank ye She will be sick else This day no man think Has business at his house for all shall stay This little one shall make it holiday Exeunt Now say Chatillon what would France with us Thus after greeting speaks the King of France In my behaviour to the majesty The borrowed majesty of England here A strange beginning- ' borrowed majesty ' Silence good mother hear the embassy Philip of France in right and true behalf Of thy deceased brother Geffrey 's son Arthur Plantagenet lays most lawful claim To this fair island and the territories To Ireland Poictiers Anjou Touraine Maine Desiring thee to lay aside the sword Which sways usurpingly these several titles And put the same into young Arthur 's hand Thy nephew and right royal sovereign What follows if we disallow of this The proud control of fierce and bloody war To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld Here have we war for war and blood for blood Controlment for controlment- so answer France Then take my king 's defiance from my mouth- The farthest limit of my embassy Bear mine to him and so depart in peace Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France For ere thou canst report I will be there The thunder of my cannon shall be heard So hence Be thou the trumpet of our wrath And sullen presage of your own decay An honourable conduct let him have- Pembroke look to ' t. Farewell Chatillon What now my son Have I not ever said How that ambitious Constance would not cease Till she had kindled France and all the world Upon the right and party of her son This might have been prevented and made whole With very easy arguments of love Which now the manage of two kingdoms must With fearful bloody issue arbitrate Our strong possession and our right for us Your strong possession much more than your right Or else it must go wrong with you and me So much my conscience whispers in your ear Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear My liege here is the strangest controversy Come from the country to be judg'd by you That e'er I heard Shall I produce the men Let them approach Exit SHERIFF Our abbeys and our priories shall pay This expedition 's charge Your faithful subject I a gentleman Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son As I suppose to Robert Faulconbridge- A soldier by the honour giving hand Of Coeur de lion knighted in the field What art thou The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge Is that the elder and art thou the heir You came not of one mother then it seems Most certain of one mother mighty king- That is well known- and as I think one father But for the certain knowledge of that truth I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother Of that I doubt as all men 's children may Out on thee rude man Thou dost shame thy mother And wound her honour with this diffidence I madam No I have no reason for it- That is my brother 's plea and none of mine The which if he can prove ' a pops me out At least from fair five hundred pound a year Heaven guard my mother 's honour and my land A good blunt fellow Why being younger born Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance I know not why except to get the land But once he slander'd me with bastardy But whe'er I be as true begot or no That still I lay upon my mother 's head But that I am as well begot my liege- Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!- Compare our faces and be judge yourself If old Sir Robert did beget us both And were our father and this son like him- O old Sir Robert father on my knee I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee Why what a madcap hath heaven lent us here He hath a trick of Coeur de lion 's face The accent of his tongue affecteth him Do you not read some tokens of my son In the large composition of this man Mine eye hath well examined his parts And finds them perfect Richard Sirrah speak What doth move you to claim your brother 's land Because he hath a half face like my father With half that face would he have all my land A half fac'd groat five hundred pound a year My gracious liege when that my father liv'd Your brother did employ my father much- Well sir by this you can not get my land Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother And once dispatch'd him in an embassy To Germany there with the Emperor To treat of high affairs touching that time Th ' advantage of his absence took the King And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father 's Where how he did prevail I shame to speak- But truth is truth large lengths of seas and shores Between my father and my mother lay As I have heard my father speak himself When this same lusty gentleman was got Upon his death bed he by will bequeath'd His lands to me and took it on his death That this my mother 's son was none of his And if he were he came into the world Full fourteen weeks before the course of time Then good my liege let me have what is mine My father 's land as was my father 's will Sirrah your brother is legitimate Your father 's wife did after wedlock bear him And if she did play false the fault was hers Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands That marry wives Tell me how if my brother Who as you say took pains to get this son Had of your father claim'd this son for his In sooth good friend your father might have kept This calf bred from his cow from all the world In sooth he might then if he were my brother 's My brother might not claim him nor your father Being none of his refuse him This concludes My mother 's son did get your father 's heir Your father 's heir must have your father 's land Shall then my father 's will be of no force To dispossess that child which is not his Of no more force to dispossess me sir Than was his will to get me as I think Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge And like thy brother to enjoy thy land Or the reputed son of Coeur de lion Lord of thy presence and no land beside Madam an if my brother had my shape And I had his Sir Robert 's his like him And if my legs were two such riding rods My arms such eel skins stuff'd my face so thin That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose Lest men should say ' Look where three farthings goes ' And to his shape were heir to all this land- Would I might never stir from off this place I would give it every foot to have this face I would not be Sir Nob in any case I like thee well Wilt thou forsake thy fortune Bequeath thy land to him and follow me I am a soldier and now bound to France Brother take you my land I 'll take my chance Your face hath got five hundred pound a year Yet sell your face for fivepence and ' tis dear Madam I 'll follow you unto the death Nay I would have you go before me thither Our country manners give our betters way What is thy name Philip my liege so is my name begun Philip good old Sir Robert 's wife 's eldest son From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest Kneel thou down Philip but rise more great- Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet Brother by th ' mother 's side give me your hand My father gave me honour yours gave land Now blessed be the hour by night or day When I was got Sir Robert was away The very spirit of Plantagenet I am thy grandam Richard call me so Madam by chance but not by truth what though Something about a little from the right In at the window or else o'er the hatch Who dares not stir by day must walk by night And have is have however men do catch Near or far off well won is still well shot And I am I howe'er I was begot Go Faulconbridge now hast thou thy desire A landless knight makes thee a landed squire Come madam and come Richard we must speed For France for France for it is more than need Brother adieu Good fortune come to thee For thou wast got i ' th ' way of honesty Where is that slave thy brother My brother Robert old Sir Robert 's son Colbrand the giant that same mighty man Is it Sir Robert 's son that you seek so Sir Robert 's son Ay thou unreverend boy Sir Robert 's son Why scorn'st thou at Sir Robert He is Sir Robert 's son and so art thou James Gurney wilt thou give us leave awhile Good leave good Philip Philip Sparrow James There 's toys abroad anon I 'll tell thee more Hast thou conspired with thy brother too That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour What means this scorn thou most untoward knave Knight knight good mother Basilisco like What I am dubb'd I have it on my shoulder But mother I am not Sir Robert 's son I have disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land Legitimation name and all is gone Then good my mother let me know my father- Some proper man I hope Who was it mother Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge As faithfully as I deny the devil King Richard Coeur de lion was thy father By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd To make room for him in my husband 's bed Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge Thou art the issue of my dear offence Which was so strongly urg'd past my defence Now by this light were I to get again Madam I would not wish a better father Some sins do bear their privilege on earth And so doth yours your fault was not your folly Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose Subjected tribute to commanding love Against whose fury and unmatched force The aweless lion could not wage the fight Nor keep his princely heart from Richard 's hand He that perforce robs lions of their hearts May easily win a woman 's Ay my mother With all my heart I thank thee for my father Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well When I was got I 'll send his soul to hell Come lady I will show thee to my kin And they shall say when Richard me begot If thou hadst said him nay it had been sin Who says it was he lies I say ' twas not Exeunt Before Angiers well met brave Austria Arthur that great forerunner of thy blood Richard that robb'd the lion of his heart And fought the holy wars in Palestine By this brave duke came early to his grave And for amends to his posterity At our importance hither is he come To spread his colours boy in thy behalf And to rebuke the usurpation Of thy unnatural uncle English John Embrace him love him give him welcome hither God shall forgive you Coeur de lion 's death The rather that you give his offspring life Shadowing their right under your wings of war I give you welcome with a powerless hand But with a heart full of unstained love Welcome before the gates of Angiers Duke A noble boy Who would not do thee right Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss As seal to this indenture of my love That to my home I will no more return Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France Together with that pale that white fac'd shore Whose foot spurns back the ocean 's roaring tides And coops from other lands her islanders- Even till that England hedg'd in with the main That water walled bulwark still secure And confident from foreign purposes- Even till that utmost corner of the west Salute thee for her king Till then fair boy Will I not think of home but follow arms O take his mother 's thanks a widow 's thanks Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength To make a more requital to your love The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords In such a just and charitable war Well then to work Our cannon shall be bent Against the brows of this resisting town Call for our chiefest men of discipline To cull the plots of best advantages We 'll lay before this town our royal bones Wade to the market place in Frenchmen 's blood But we will make it subject to this boy Stay for an answer to your embassy Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood My Lord Chatillon may from England bring That right in peace which here we urge in war And then we shall repent each drop of blood That hot rash haste so indirectly shed A wonder lady Lo upon thy wish Our messenger Chatillon is arriv'd What England says say briefly gentle lord We coldly pause for thee Chatillon speak Then turn your forces from this paltry siege And stir them up against a mightier task England impatient of your just demands Hath put himself in arms The adverse winds Whose leisure I have stay'd have given him time To land his legions all as soon as I His marches are expedient to this town His forces strong his soldiers confident With him along is come the mother queen An Ate stirring him to blood and strife With her the Lady Blanch of Spain With them a bastard of the king 's deceas'd And all th ' unsettled humours of the land- Rash inconsiderate fiery voluntaries With ladies ' faces and fierce dragons ' spleens- Have sold their fortunes at their native homes Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs To make a hazard of new fortunes here In brief a braver choice of dauntless spirits Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er Did never float upon the swelling tide To do offence and scathe in Christendom Drum beats The interruption of their churlish drums Cuts off more circumstance they are at hand To parley or to fight therefore prepare How much unlook'd for is this expedition By how much unexpected by so much We must awake endeavour for defence For courage mounteth with occasion Let them be welcome then we are prepar'd Peace be to France if France in peace permit Our just and lineal entrance to our own If not bleed France and peace ascend to heaven Whiles we God 's wrathful agent do correct Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven Peace be to England if that war return From France to England there to live in peace England we love and for that England 's sake With burden of our armour here we sweat This toil of ours should be a work of thine But thou from loving England art so far That thou hast under wrought his lawful king Cut off the sequence of posterity Outfaced infant state and done a rape Upon the maiden virtue of the crown Look here upon thy brother Geffrey 's face These eyes these brows were moulded out of his This little abstract doth contain that large Which died in Geffrey and the hand of time Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume That Geffrey was thy elder brother born And this his son England was Geffrey 's right And this is Geffrey 's In the name of God How comes it then that thou art call'd a king When living blood doth in these temples beat Which owe the crown that thou o'er masterest From whom hast thou this great commission France To draw my answer from thy articles From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts In any

more temperate It ill beseems this presence to cry aim To these ill tuned repetitions Some trumpet summon hither to the walls These men of Angiers let us hear them speak Whose title they admit Arthur 's or John 's Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls ' Tis France for England England for itself You men of Angiers and my loving subjects- You loving men of Angiers Arthur 's subjects Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle- For our advantage therefore hear us first These flags of France that are advanced here Before the eye and prospect of your town Have hither march'd to your endamagement The cannons have their bowels full of wrath And ready mounted are they to spit forth Their iron indignation ' gainst your walls All preparation for a bloody siege And merciless proceeding by these French Confront your city 's eyes your winking gates And but for our approach those sleeping stones That as a waist doth girdle you about By the compulsion of their ordinance By this time from their fixed beds of lime Had been dishabited and wide havoc made For bloody power to rush upon your peace But on the sight of us your lawful king Who painfully with much expedient march Have brought a countercheck before your gates To save unscratch'd your city 's threat'ned cheeks- Behold the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle And now instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire To make a shaking fever in your walls They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke To make a faithless error in your cars Which trust accordingly kind citizens And let us in your King whose labour'd spirits Forwearied in this action of swift speed Craves harbourage within your city walls When I have said make answer to us both Lo in this right hand whose protection Is most divinely vow'd upon the right Of him it holds stands young Plantagenet Son to the elder brother of this man And king o'er him and all that he enjoys For this down trodden equity we tread In warlike march these greens before your town Being no further enemy to you Than the constraint of hospitable zeal In the relief of this oppressed child Religiously provokes Be pleased then To pay that duty which you truly owe To him that owes it namely this young prince And then our arms like to a muzzled bear Save in aspect hath all offence seal'd up Our cannons ' malice vainly shall be spent Against th ' invulnerable clouds of heaven And with a blessed and unvex'd retire With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd We will bear home that lusty blood again Which here we came to spout against your town And leave your children wives and you in peace But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer ' Tis not the roundure of your old fac'd walls Can hide you from our messengers of war Though all these English and their discipline Were harbour'd in their rude circumference Then tell us shall your city call us lord In that behalf which we have challeng'd it Or shall we give the signal to our rage And stalk in blood to our possession In brief we are the King of England 's subjects For him and in his right we hold this town Acknowledge then the King and let me in That can we not but he that proves the King To him will we prove loyal Till that time Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world Doth not the crown of England prove the King And if not that I bring you witnesses Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England 's breed- Bastards and else To verify our title with their lives As many and as well born bloods as those- Some bastards too Stand in his face to contradict his claim Till you compound whose right is worthiest We for the worthiest hold the right from both Then God forgive the sin of all those souls That to their everlasting residence Before the dew of evening fall shall fleet In dreadful trial of our kingdom 's king Amen Amen Mount chevaliers to arms Saint George that swing'd the dragon and e'er since Sits on 's horse back at mine hostess ' door Teach us some fence To AUSTRIA Sirrah were I at home At your den sirrah with your lioness I would set an ox head to your lion 's hide And make a monster of you Peace no more O tremble for you hear the lion roar Up higher to the plain where we 'll set forth In best appointment all our regiments Speed then to take advantage of the field It shall be so and at the other hill Command the rest to stand God and our right Exeunt You men of Angiers open wide your gates And let young Arthur Duke of Britaine in Who by the hand of France this day hath made Much work for tears in many an English mother Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground Many a widow 's husband grovelling lies Coldly embracing the discoloured earth And victory with little loss doth play Upon the dancing banners of the French Who are at hand triumphantly displayed To enter conquerors and to proclaim Arthur of Britaine England 's King and yours Rejoice you men of Angiers ring your bells King John your king and England 's doth approach Commander of this hot malicious day Their armours that march'd hence so silver bright Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen 's blood There stuck no plume in any English crest That is removed by a staff of France Our colours do return in those same hands That did display them when we first march'd forth And like a jolly troop of huntsmen come Our lusty English all with purpled hands Dy'd in the dying slaughter of their foes Open your gates and give the victors way Heralds from off our tow'rs we might behold From first to last the onset and retire Of both your armies whose equality By our best eyes can not be censured Blood hath bought blood and blows have answer'd blows Strength match'd with strength and power confronted power Both are alike and both alike we like One must prove greatest While they weigh so even We hold our town for neither yet for both France hast thou yet more blood to cast away Say shall the current of our right run on Whose passage vex'd with thy impediment Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell With course disturb'd even thy confining shores Unless thou let his silver water keep A peaceful progress to the ocean England thou hast not sav'd one drop of blood In this hot trial more than we of France Rather lost more And by this hand I swear That sways the earth this climate overlooks Before we will lay down our just borne arms We 'll put thee down ' gainst whom these arms we bear Or add a royal number to the dead Gracing the scroll that tells of this war 's loss With slaughter coupled to the name of kings Ha majesty how high thy glory tow'rs When the rich blood of kings is set on fire O now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel The swords of soldiers are his teeth his fangs And now he feasts mousing the flesh of men In undetermin'd differences of kings Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus Cry ' havoc ' kings back to the stained field You equal potents fiery kindled spirits Then let confusion of one part confirm The other 's peace Till then blows blood and death Whose party do the townsmen yet admit Speak citizens for England who 's your king The King of England when we know the King Know him in us that here hold up his right In us that are our own great deputy And bear possession of our person here Lord of our presence Angiers and of you A greater pow'r than we denies all this And till it be undoubted we do lock Our former scruple in our strong barr'd gates King'd of our fears until our fears resolv'd Be by some certain king purg'd and depos'd By heaven these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings And stand securely on their battlements As in a theatre whence they gape and point At your industrious scenes and acts of death Your royal presences be rul'd by me Do like the mutines of Jerusalem Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town By east and west let France and England mount Their battering cannon charged to the mouths Till their soul fearing clamours have brawl'd down The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city I 'd play incessantly upon these jades Even till unfenced desolation Leave them as naked as the vulgar air That done dissever your united strengths And part your mingled colours once again Turn face to face and bloody point to point Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth Out of one side her happy minion To whom in favour she shall give the day And kiss him with a glorious victory How like you this wild counsel mighty states Smacks it not something of the policy Now by the sky that hangs above our heads I like it well France shall we knit our pow'rs And lay this Angiers even with the ground Then after fight who shall be king of it An if thou hast the mettle of a king Being wrong'd as we are by this peevish town Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery As we will ours against these saucy walls And when that we have dash'd them to the ground Why then defy each other and pell mell Make work upon ourselves for heaven or hell Let it be so Say where will you assault We from the west will send destruction Into this city 's bosom I from the north Our thunder from the south Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town Aside O prudent discipline From north to south Austria and France shoot in each other 's mouth I 'll stir them to it.-Come away away Hear us great kings vouchsafe awhile to stay And I shall show you peace and fair fac'd league Win you this city without stroke or wound Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds That here come sacrifices for the field Persever not but hear me mighty kings Speak on with favour we are bent to hear That daughter there of Spain the Lady Blanch Is niece to England look upon the years Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid If lusty love should go in quest of beauty Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch If zealous love should go in search of virtue Where should he find it purer than in Blanch If love ambitious sought a match of birth Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch Such as she is in beauty virtue birth Is the young Dauphin every way complete- If not complete of say he is not she And she again wants nothing to name want If want it be not that she is not he He is the half part of a blessed man Left to be finished by such as she And she a fair divided excellence Whose fulness of perfection lies in him O two such silver currents when they join Do glorify the banks that bound them in And two such shores to two such streams made one Two such controlling bounds shall you be Kings To these two princes if you marry them This union shall do more than battery can To our fast closed gates for at this match With swifter spleen than powder can enforce The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope And give you entrance but without this match The sea enraged is not half so deaf Lions more confident mountains and rocks More free from motion no not Death himself In mortal fury half so peremptory As we to keep this city Here 's a stay That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death Out of his rags Here 's a large mouth indeed That spits forth death and mountains rocks and seas Talks as familiarly of roaring lions As maids of thirteen do of puppy dogs What cannoneer begot this lusty blood He speaks plain cannon fire and smoke and bounce He gives the bastinado with his tongue Our ears are cudgell'd not a word of his But buffets better than a fist of France Zounds I was never so bethump'd with words Since I first call'd my brother 's father dad Son list to this conjunction make this match Give with our niece a dowry large enough For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie Thy now unsur'd assurance to the crown That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit I see a yielding in the looks of France Mark how they whisper Urge them while their souls Are capable of this ambition Lest zeal now melted by the windy breath Of soft petitions pity and remorse Cool and congeal again to what it was Why answer not the double majesties This friendly treaty of our threat'ned town Speak England first that hath been forward first To speak unto this city what say you If that the Dauphin there thy princely son Can in this book of beauty read ' I love ' Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen For Anjou and fair Touraine Maine Poictiers And all that we upon this side the sea- Except this city now by us besieg'd- Find liable to our crown and dignity Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich In titles honours and promotions As she in beauty education blood Holds hand with any princess of the world What say'st thou boy Look in the lady 's face I do my lord and in her eye I find A wonder or a wondrous miracle The shadow of myself form'd in her eye Which being but the shadow of your son Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow I do protest I never lov'd myself Till now infixed I beheld myself Drawn in the flattering table of her eye Aside Drawn in the flattering table of her eye Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow And quarter'd in her heart he doth espy Himself love 's traitor This is pity now That hang'd and drawn and quarter'd there should be In such a love so vile a lout as he My uncle 's will in this respect is mine If he see aught in you that makes him like That anything he sees which moves his liking I can with ease translate it to my will Or if you will to speak more properly I will enforce it eas'ly to my love Further I will not flatter you my lord That all I see in you is worthy love Than this that nothing do I see in you- Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge- That I can find should merit any hate What say these young ones What say you my niece That she is bound in honour still to do What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say Speak then Prince Dauphin can you love this lady Nay ask me if I can refrain from love For I do love her most unfeignedly Then do I give Volquessen Touraine Maine Poictiers and Anjou these five provinces With her to thee and this addition more Full thirty thousand marks of English coin Philip of France if thou be pleas'd withal Command thy son and daughter to join hands It likes us well young princes close your hands And your lips too for I am well assur'd That I did so when I was first assur'd Now citizens of Angiers ope your gates Let in that amity which you have made For at Saint Mary 's chapel presently The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd Is not the Lady Constance in this troop I know she is not for this match made up Her presence would have interrupted much Where is she and her son Tell me who knows She is sad and passionate at your Highness ' tent And by my faith this league that we have made Will give her sadness very little cure Brother of England how may we content This widow lady In her right we came Which we God knows have turn'd another way To our own vantage We will heal up all For we 'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine And Earl of Richmond and this rich fair town We make him lord of Call the Lady Constance Some speedy messenger bid her repair To our solemnity I trust we shall If not fill up the measure of her will Yet in some measure satisfy her so That we shall stop her exclamation Go we as well as haste will suffer us To this unlook'd for unprepared pomp Mad world mad kings mad composition John to stop Arthur 's tide in the whole Hath willingly departed with a part And France whose armour conscience buckled on Whom zeal and charity brought to the field As God 's own soldier rounded in the ear With that same purpose changer that sly devil That broker that still breaks the pate of faith That daily break vow he that wins of all Of kings of beggars old men young men maids Who having no external thing to lose But the word ' maid ' cheats the poor maid of that That smooth fac'd gentleman tickling commodity Commodity the bias of the world- The world who of itself is peised well Made to run even upon even ground Till this advantage this vile drawing bias This sway of motion this commodity Makes it take head from all indifferency From all direction purpose course intent- And this same bias this commodity This bawd this broker this all changing word Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France Hath drawn him from his own determin'd aid From a resolv'd and honourable war To a most base and vile concluded peace And why rail I on this commodity But for because he hath not woo'd me yet Not that I have the power to clutch my hand When his fair angels would salute my palm But for my hand as unattempted yet Like a poor beggar raileth on the rich Well whiles I am a beggar I will rail And say there is no sin but to be rich And being rich my virtue then shall be To say there is no vice but beggary Since kings break faith upon commodity Gain be my lord for I will worship thee Exit Gone to be married Gone to swear a peace False blood to false blood join'd Gone to be friends Shall Lewis have Blanch and Blanch those provinces It is not so thou hast misspoke misheard Be well advis'd tell o'er thy tale again It can not be thou dost but say ' tis so I trust I may not trust thee for thy word Is but the vain breath of a common man Believe me I do not believe thee man I have a king 's oath to the contrary Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me For I am sick and capable of fears Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears A widow husbandless subject to fears A woman naturally born to fears And though thou now confess thou didst but jest With my vex'd spirits I can not take a truce But they will quake and tremble all this day What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head Why dost thou look so sadly on my son What means that hand upon that breast of thine Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words Then speak again not all thy former tale But this one word whether thy tale be true As true as I believe you think them false That give you cause to prove my saying true O if thou teach me to believe this sorrow Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die And let belief and life encounter so As doth the fury of two desperate men Which in the very meeting fall and die Lewis marry Blanch O boy then where art thou France friend with England what becomes of me Fellow be gone I can not brook thy sight This news hath made thee a most ugly man What other harm have I good lady done But spoke the harm that is by others done Which harm within itself so heinous is As it makes harmful all that speak of it I do beseech you madam be content If thou that bid'st me be content wert grim Ugly and sland'rous to thy mother 's womb Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains Lame foolish crooked swart prodigious Patch'd with foul moles and eye offending marks I would not care I then would be content For then I should not love thee no nor thou Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown But thou art fair and at thy birth dear boy Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great Of Nature 's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast And with the half blown rose but Fortune O She is corrupted chang'd and won from thee Sh ' adulterates hourly with thine uncle John And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France To tread down fair respect of sovereignty And made his majesty the bawd to theirs France is a bawd to Fortune and King John- That strumpet Fortune that usurping John Tell me thou fellow is not France forsworn Envenom him with words or get thee gone And leave those woes alone which I alone Am bound to under bear Pardon me madam I may not go without you to the kings Thou mayst thou shalt I will not go with thee I will instruct my sorrows to be proud For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop To me and to the state of my great grief Let kings assemble for my grief 's so great That no supporter but the huge firm earth Can hold it up Seats herself on the ground Here I and sorrows sit Here is my throne bid kings come bow to it ' Tis true fair daughter and this blessed day Ever in France shall be kept festival To solemnize this day the glorious sun Stays in his course and plays the alchemist Turning with splendour of his precious eye The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold The yearly course that brings this day about Shall never see it but a holiday Rising A wicked day and not a holy day What hath this day deserv'd what hath it done That it in golden letters should be set Among the high tides in the calendar Nay rather turn this day out of the week This day of shame oppression perjury Or if it must stand still let wives with child Pray that their burdens may not fall this day Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd But on this day let seamen fear no wreck No bargains break that are not this day made This day all things begun come to ill end Yea faith itself to hollow falsehood change By heaven lady you shall have no cause To curse the fair proceedings of this day Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty You have beguil'd me with a counterfeit Resembling majesty which being touch'd and tried Proves valueless you are forsworn forsworn You came in arms to spill mine enemies ' blood But now in arms you strengthen it with yours The grappling vigour and rough frown of war Is cold in amity and painted peace And our oppression hath made up this league Arm arm you heavens against these perjur'd kings A widow cries Be husband to me heavens Let not the hours of this ungodly day Wear out the day in peace but ere sunset Set armed discord ' twixt these perjur'd kings Hear me O hear me Lady Constance peace War war no peace Peace is to me a war O Lymoges O Austria thou dost shame That bloody spoil Thou slave thou wretch thou coward Thou little valiant great in villainy Thou ever strong upon the stronger side Thou Fortune 's champion that dost never fight But when her humorous ladyship is by To teach thee safety Thou art perjur'd too And sooth'st up greatness What a fool art thou A ramping fool to brag and stamp and swear Upon my party Thou cold blooded slave Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side Been sworn my soldier bidding me depend Upon thy stars thy fortune and thy strength And dost thou now fall over to my foes Thou wear a lion 's hide Doff it for shame And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs O that a man should speak those words to me And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs Thou dar'st not say so villain for thy life And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs We like not this thou dost forget thyself Here comes the holy legate of the Pope Hail you anointed deputies of heaven To thee King John my holy errand is I Pandulph of fair Milan cardinal And from Pope Innocent the legate here Do in his name religiously demand Why thou against the Church our holy mother So wilfully dost spurn and force perforce Keep Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop Of Canterbury from that holy see This in our foresaid holy father 's name Pope Innocent I do demand of thee What earthly name to interrogatories Can task the free breath of a sacred king Thou canst not Cardinal devise a name So slight unworthy and ridiculous To charge me to an answer as the Pope Tell him this tale and from the mouth of England Add thus much more that no Italian priest Shall tithe or toll in our dominions But as we under heaven are supreme head So under Him that great supremacy Where we do reign we will alone uphold Without th ' assistance of a mortal hand So tell the Pope all reverence set apart To him and his usurp'd authority Brother of England you blaspheme in this Though you and all the kings of Christendom Are led so grossly by this meddling priest Dreading the curse that money may buy out And by the merit of vile gold dross dust Purchase corrupted pardon of a man Who in that sale sells pardon from himself- Though you and all the rest so grossly led This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish Yet I alone alone do me oppose Against the Pope and count his friends my foes Then by the lawful power that I have Thou shalt stand curs'd and excommunicate And blessed shall he be that doth revolt From his allegiance to an heretic And meritorious shall that hand be call'd Canonized and worshipp'd as a saint That takes away by any secret course Thy hateful life O lawful let it be That I have room with Rome to curse awhile Good father Cardinal cry thou ' amen ' To my keen curses for without my wrong There is no tongue hath power to curse him right There 's law and warrant lady for my curse And for mine too when law can do no right Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong Law can not give my child his kingdom here For he that holds his kingdom holds the law Therefore since law itself is perfect wrong How can the law forbid my tongue to curse Philip of France on peril of a curse Let go the hand of that arch heretic And raise the power of France upon his head Unless he do submit himself to Rome Look'st thou pale France Do not let go thy hand Look to that devil lest that France repent And by disjoining hands hell lose a soul King Philip listen to the Cardinal And hang a calf's skin on his recreant limbs Well ruffian I must pocket up these wrongs Because- Your breeches best may carry them Philip what say'st thou to the Cardinal What should he say but as the Cardinal Bethink you father for the difference Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome Or the light loss of England for a friend Forgo the easier That 's the curse of Rome O Lewis stand fast The devil tempts thee here In likeness of a new untrimmed bride The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith But from her need O if thou grant my need Which only lives but by the death of faith That need must needs infer this principle- That faith would live again by death of need O then tread down my need and faith mounts up Keep my need up and faith is trodden down The King is mov'd and answers not to this O be remov'd from him and answer well Do so King Philip hang no more in doubt Hang nothing but a calf's skin most sweet lout I am perplex'd and know not what to say What canst thou say but will perplex thee more If thou stand excommunicate and curs'd Good reverend father make my person yours And tell me how you would bestow yourself This royal hand and mine are newly knit And the conjunction of our inward souls Married in league coupled and link'd together With all religious strength of sacred vows The latest breath that gave the sound of words Was deep sworn faith peace amity true love Between our kingdoms and our royal selves And even before this truce but new before No longer than we well could wash our hands To clap this royal bargain up of peace Heaven knows they were besmear'd and overstain'd With slaughter 's pencil where revenge did paint The fearful difference of incensed kings And shall these hands so lately purg'd of blood So newly join'd in love so strong in both Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet Play fast and loose with faith so jest with heaven Make such unconstant children of ourselves As now again to snatch our palm from palm Unswear faith sworn and on the marriage bed Of smiling peace to march a bloody host And make a riot on the gentle brow Of true sincerity O holy sir My reverend father let it not be so Out of your grace devise ordain impose Some gentle order and then we shall be blest To do your pleasure and continue friends All form is formless order orderless Save what is opposite to England 's love Therefore to arms be champion of our church Or let the church our mother breathe her curse- A mother 's curse on her revolting son France thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue A chafed lion by the mortal paw A fasting tiger safer by the tooth Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold I may disjoin my hand but not my faith So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith And like a civil war set'st oath to oath Thy tongue against thy tongue O let thy vow First made to heaven first be to heaven perform'd That is to be the champion of our Church What since thou swor'st is sworn against thyself And may not be performed by thyself For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss Is not amiss when it is truly done And being not done where doing tends to ill The truth is then most done not doing it The better act of purposes mistook Is to mistake again though indirect Yet indirection thereby grows direct And falsehood cures as fire cools fire Within the scorched veins of one new burn'd It is religion that doth make vows kept But thou hast sworn against religion By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st And mak'st an oath the surety for thy truth Against an oath the truth thou art unsure To swear swears only not to be forsworn Else what a mockery should it be to swear But thou dost swear only to be forsworn And most forsworn to keep what thou dost swear Therefore thy later vows against thy first Is in thyself rebellion to thyself And better conquest never canst thou make Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts Against these giddy loose suggestions Upon which better part our pray'rs come in If thou vouchsafe them But if not then know The peril of our curses fight on thee So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off But in despair die under the black weight Rebellion flat rebellion Will't not be Will not a calf's skin stop that mouth of thine Father to arms Upon thy wedding day Against the blood that thou hast married What shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums Clamours of hell be measures to our pomp O husband hear me ay alack how new Is ' husband ' in my mouth even for that name Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce Upon my knee I beg go not to arms Against mine uncle O upon my knee Made hard with kneeling I do pray to thee Thou virtuous Dauphin alter not the doom Forethought by heaven Now shall I see thy love What motive may Be stronger with thee than the name of wife That which upholdeth him that thee upholds His honour O thine honour Lewis thine honour I muse your Majesty doth seem so cold When such profound respects do pull you on I will denounce a curse upon his head Thou shalt not need England I will fall from thee O fair return of banish'd majesty O foul revolt of French inconstancy France thou shalt rue this hour within this hour Old Time the clock setter that bald sexton Time Is it as he will Well then France shall rue The sun 's o'ercast with blood Fair day adieu Which is the side that I must go withal I am with both each army hath a hand And in their rage I having hold of both They whirl asunder and dismember me Husband I can not pray that thou mayst win Uncle I needs must pray that thou mayst lose Father I may not wish the fortune thine Grandam I will not wish thy wishes thrive Whoever wins on that side shall I lose Assured loss before the match be play'd Lady with me with me thy fortune lies There where my fortune lives there my life dies Cousin go draw our puissance together Thy rage shall burn thee up and thou shalt turn To ashes ere our blood shall quench that fire Look to thyself thou art in jeopardy No more than he that threats To arms let 's hie Now by my life this day grows wondrous hot Some airy devil hovers in the sky And pours down mischief Austria 's head lie there While Philip breathes Hubert keep this boy Philip make up My mother is assailed in our tent And ta'en I fear My lord I rescued her Her Highness is in safety fear you not But on my liege for very little pains Will bring this labour to an happy end Exeunt To ELINOR So shall it be your Grace shall stay O this will make my mother die with grief To the BASTARD Cousin away for England haste Bell book and candle shall not drive me back When gold and silver becks me to come on I leave your Highness Grandam I will pray If ever I remember to be holy For your fair safety So I kiss your hand Farewell gentle cousin Coz farewell Come hither little kinsman hark a word Come hither Hubert O my gentle Hubert We owe thee much Within this wall of flesh There is a soul counts thee her creditor And with advantage means to pay thy love And my good friend thy voluntary oath Lives in this bosom dearly cherished Give me thy hand I had a thing to say- But I will fit it with some better time By heaven Hubert I am almost asham'd To say what good respect I have of thee I am much bounden to your Majesty Good friend thou hast no cause to say so yet But thou shalt have and creep time ne'er so slow Yet it shall come for me to do thee good I had a thing to say but let it go The sun is in the heaven and the proud day Attended with the pleasures of the world Is all too wanton and too full of gawds To give me audience If the midnight bell Did with his iron tongue and brazen mouth Sound on into the drowsy race of night If this same were a churchyard where we stand And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs Or if that surly spirit melancholy Had bak'd thy blood and made it heavy thick Which else runs tickling up and down the veins Making that idiot laughter keep men 's eyes And strain their cheeks to idle merriment A passion hateful to my purposes Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes Hear me without thine cars and make reply Without a tongue using conceit alone Without eyes ears and harmful sound of words- Then in despite of brooded watchful day I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts But ah I will not Yet I love thee well And by my troth I think thou lov'st me well So well that what you bid me undertake Though that my death were adjunct to my act By heaven I would do it Do not I know thou wouldst Good Hubert Hubert Hubert throw thine eye On yon young boy I 'll tell thee what my friend He is a very serpent in my way And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread He lies before me Dost thou understand me Thou art his keeper And I 'll keep him so That he shall not offend your Majesty Death My lord A grave He shall not live Enough I could be merry now Hubert I love thee Well I 'll not say what I intend for thee Remember Madam fare you well I 'll send those powers o'er to your Majesty My blessing go with thee To ARTHUR For England cousin go Hubert shall be your man attend on you With all true duty On toward Calais ho Exeunt So by a roaring tempest on the flood A whole armado of convicted sail Is scattered and disjoin'd from fellowship Courage and comfort All shall yet go well What can go well when we have run so ill Are we not beaten Is not Angiers lost Arthur ta'en prisoner Divers dear friends slain And bloody England into England gone O'erbearing interruption spite of France he hath won that hath he fortified So hot a speed with such advice dispos'd Such temperate order in so fierce a cause Doth want example who hath read or heard Of any kindred action like to this Well could I bear that England had this praise So we could find some pattern of our shame Lo now now see the issue of your peace Patience good lady Comfort gentle Constance No I defy all counsel all redress But that which ends all counsel true redress- Death death O amiable lovely death Thou odoriferous stench sound rottenness Arise forth from the couch of lasting night Thou hate and terror to prosperity And I will kiss thy detestable bones And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows And ring these fingers with thy household worms And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust And be a carrion monster like thyself Come grin on me and I will think thou smil'st And buss thee as thy wife Misery 's love O come to me O fair affliction peace No no I will not having breath to cry O that my tongue were in the thunder 's mouth Then with a passion would I shake the world And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy Which can not hear a lady 's feeble voice Which scorns a modern invocation Lady you utter madness and not sorrow Thou art not holy to belie me so I am not mad this hair I tear is mine My name is Constance I was Geffrey 's wife Young Arthur is my son and he is lost I am not mad I would to heaven I were For then ' tis like I should forget myself O if I could what grief should I forget Preach some philosophy to make me mad And thou shalt be canoniz'd Cardinal For being not mad but sensible of grief My reasonable part produces reason How I may be deliver'd of these woes And teaches me to kill or hang myself If I were mad I should forget my son Or madly think a babe of clouts were he I am not mad too well too well I feel The different plague of each calamity Bind up those tresses O what love I note In the fair multitude of those her hairs Where but by a chance a silver drop hath fall'n Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends Do glue themselves in sociable grief Like true inseparable faithful loves Sticking together in calamity To England if you will Bind up your hairs Yes that I will and wherefore will I do it I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud ' O that these hands could so redeem my son As they have given these hairs their liberty ' But now I envy at their liberty And will again commit them to their bonds Because my poor child is a prisoner And father Cardinal I have heard you say That we shall see and know our friends in heaven If that be true I shall see my boy again For since the birth of Cain the first male child To him that did but yesterday suspire There was not such a gracious creature born But now will canker sorrow eat my bud And chase the native beauty from his cheek And he will look as hollow as a ghost As dim and meagre as an ague 's fit And so he 'll die and rising so again When I shall meet him in the court of heaven I shall not know him Therefore never never Must I behold my pretty Arthur more You hold too heinous a respect of grief He talks to me that never had a son You are as fond of grief as of your child Grief fills the room up of my absent child Lies in his bed walks up and down with me Puts on his pretty looks repeats his words Remembers me of all his gracious parts Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form Then have I reason to be fond of grief Fare you well had you such a loss as I I could give better comfort than you do I will not keep this form upon my head I fear some outrage and I 'll follow her Exit There 's nothing in this world can make me joy Life is as tedious as a twice told tale Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world 's taste That it yields nought but shame and bitterness Before the curing of a strong disease Even in the instant of repair and health The fit is strongest evils that take leave On their departure most of all show evil What have you lost by losing of this day All days of glory joy and happiness If you had won it certainly you had No no when Fortune means to men most good She looks upon them with a threat'ning eye ' Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost In this which he accounts so clearly won Are not you griev'd that Arthur is his prisoner As heartily as he is glad he hath him Your mind is all as youthful as your blood Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit For even the breath of what I mean to speak Shall blow each dust each straw each little rub Out of the path which shall directly lead Thy foot to England 's throne And therefore mark John hath seiz'd Arthur and it can not be That whiles warm life plays in that infant 's veins The misplac'd John should entertain an hour One minute nay one quiet breath of rest A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand Must be boisterously maintain'd as gain'd And he that stands upon a slipp'ry place Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up That John may stand then Arthur needs must fall So be it for it can not be but so But what shall I gain by young Arthur 's fall You in the right of Lady Blanch your wife May then make all the claim that Arthur did And lose it life and all as Arthur did How green you are and fresh in this old world John lays you plots the times conspire with you For he that steeps his safety in true blood Shall find but bloody safety and untrue This act so evilly borne shall cool the hearts Of all his people and freeze up their zeal That none so small advantage shall step forth To check his reign but they will cherish it No natural exhalation in the sky No scope of nature no distemper'd day No common wind no customed event But they will pluck away his natural cause And call them meteors prodigies and signs Abortives presages and tongues of heaven Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John May be he will not touch young Arthur 's life But hold himself safe in his prisonment O Sir when he shall hear of your approach If that young Arthur be not gone already Even at that news he dies and then the hearts Of all his people shall revolt from him And kiss the lips of unacquainted change And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath Out of the bloody fingers ' ends of john Methinks I see this hurly all on foot And O what better matter breeds for you Than I have nam'd The bastard Faulconbridge Is now in England ransacking the Church Offending charity if but a dozen French Were there in arms they would be as a can To train ten thousand English to their side Or as a little snow tumbled about Anon becomes a mountain O noble Dauphin Go with me to the King ' Tis wonderful What may be wrought out of their discontent Now that their souls are topful of offence For England go I will whet on the King Strong reasons makes strong actions Let us go If you say ay the King will not say no Exeunt Heat me these irons hot and look thou stand Within the arras When I strike my foot Upon the bosom of the ground rush forth And bind the boy which you shall find with me Fast to the chair Be heedful hence and watch I hope your warrant will bear out the deed Uncleanly scruples Fear not you Look to't Good morrow Hubert Good morrow little Prince As little prince having so great a tide To be more prince as may be You are sad Indeed I have been merrier Mercy on me Methinks no body should be sad but I Yet I remember when I was in France Young gentlemen would be as sad as night Only for wantonness By my christendom So I were out of prison and kept sheep I should be as merry as the day is long And so I would be here but that I doubt My uncle practises more harm to me He is afraid of me and I of him Is it my fault that I was Geffrey 's son No indeed ist not and I would to heaven I were your son so you would love me Hubert Aside If I talk to him with his innocent prate He will awake my mercy which lies dead Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch Are you sick Hubert You look pale to day In sooth I would you were a little sick That I might sit all night and watch with you I warrant I love you more than you do me Aside His words do take possession of my bosom.- Read here young Arthur Showing a paper Too fairly Hubert for so foul effect Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes Young boy I must And will you And I will Have you the heart When your head did but ache I knit my handkerchief about your brows- The best I had a princess wrought it me- And I did never ask it you again And with my hand at midnight held your head And like the watchful minutes to the hour Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time Saying ' What lack you ' and ' Where lies your grief ' Or ' What good love may I perform for you ' Many a poor man 's son would have lyen still And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you But you at your sick service had a prince Nay you may think my love was crafty love And call it cunning Do an if you will If heaven be pleas'd that you must use me ill Why then you must Will you put out mine eyes These eyes that never did nor never shall So much as frown on you I have sworn to do it And with hot irons must I burn them out Ah none but in this iron age would do it The iron of itself though heat red hot Approaching near these eyes would drink my tears And quench his fiery indignation Even in the matter of mine innocence Nay after that consume away in rust But for containing fire to harm mine eye Are you more stubborn hard than hammer'd iron An if an angel should have come to me And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes I would not have believ'd him no tongue but Hubert 's Stamps Come forth O save me Hubert save me My eyes are out Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men Give me the iron I say and bind him here Alas what need you be so boist'rous rough I will not struggle I will stand stone still For heaven sake Hubert let me not be bound Nay hear me Hubert Drive these men away And I will sit as quiet as a lamb I will not stir nor wince nor speak a word Nor look upon the iron angrily Thrust but these men away and I 'll forgive you Whatever torment you do put me to Go stand within let me alone with him I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed Alas I then have chid away my friend He hath a stern look but a gentle heart Let him come back that his compassion may Give life to yours Come boy prepare yourself Is there no remedy None but to lose your eyes O heaven that there were but a mote in yours A grain a dust a gnat a wandering hair Any annoyance in that precious sense Then feeling what small things are boisterous there Your vile intent must needs seem horrible Is this your promise Go to hold your tongue Hubert the utterance of a brace of tongues Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes Let me not hold my tongue let me not Hubert Or Hubert if you will cut out my tongue So I may keep mine eyes O spare mine eyes Though to no use but still to look on you Lo by my troth the instrument is cold And would not harm me I can heat it boy No in good sooth the fire is dead with grief Being create for comfort to be us'd In undeserved extremes See else yourself There is no malice in this burning coal The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out And strew'd repentant ashes on his head But with my breath I can revive it boy An if you do you will but make it blush And glow with shame of your proceedings Hubert Nay it perchance will sparkle in your eyes And like a dog that is compell'd to fight Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on All things that you should use to do me wrong Deny their office only you do lack That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends Creatures of note for mercy lacking uses Well see to live I will not touch thine eye For all the treasure that thine uncle owes Yet I am sworn and I did purpose boy With this same very iron to burn them out O now you look like Hubert All this while You were disguis'd Peace no more Adieu Your uncle must not know but you are dead I 'll fill these dogged spies with false reports And pretty child sleep doubtless and secure That Hubert for the wealth of all the world Will not offend thee O heaven I thank you Hubert Silence no more Go closely in with me Much danger do I undergo for thee Exeunt Here once again we sit once again crown'd And look'd upon I hope with cheerful eyes This once again but that your Highness pleas'd Was once superfluous you were crown'd before And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt Fresh expectation troubled not the land With any long'd for change or better state Therefore to be possess'd with double pomp To guard a title that was rich before To gild refined gold to paint the lily To throw a perfume on the violet To smooth the ice or add another hue Unto the rainbow or with taper light To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish Is wasteful and ridiculous excess But that your royal pleasure must be done This act is as an ancient tale new told And in the last repeating troublesome Being urged at a time unseasonable In this the antique and well noted face Of plain old form is much disfigured And like a shifted wind unto a sail It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about Startles and frights consideration Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected For putting on so new a fashion'd robe When workmen strive to do better than well They do confound their skill in covetousness And oftentimes excusing of a fault Doth make the fault the worse by th ' excuse As patches set upon a little breach Discredit more in hiding of the fault Than did the fault before it was so patch'd To this effect before you were new crown'd We breath'd our counsel but it pleas'd your Highness To overbear it and we are all well pleas'd Since all and every part of what we would Doth make a stand at what your Highness will Some reasons of this double coronation I have possess'd you with and think them strong And more more strong when lesser is my fear I shall indue you with Meantime but ask What you would have reform'd that is not well And well shall you perceive how willingly I will both hear and grant you your requests Then I as one that am the tongue of these To sound the purposes of all their hearts Both for myself and them- but chief of all Your safety for the which myself and them Bend their best studies heartily request Th ' enfranchisement of Arthur whose restraint Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent To break into this dangerous argument If what in rest you have in right you hold Why then your fears which as they say attend The steps of wrong should move you to mew up Your tender kinsman and to choke his days With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth The rich advantage of good exercise That the time 's enemies may not have this To grace occasions let it be our suit That you have bid us ask his liberty Which for our goods we do no further ask Than whereupon our weal on you depending Counts it your weal he have his liberty Let it be so I do commit his youth To your direction This is the man should do the bloody deed He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine The image of a wicked heinous fault Lives in his eye that close aspect of his Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast And I do fearfully believe ' tis done What we so fear'd he had a charge to do The colour of the King doth come and go Between his purpose and his conscience Like heralds ' twixt two dreadful battles set His passion is so ripe it needs must break And when it breaks I fear will issue thence The foul corruption of a sweet child 's death We can not hold mortality 's strong hand Good lords although my will to give is living The suit which you demand is gone and dead He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to night Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure Indeed we heard how near his death he was Before the child himself felt he was sick This must be answer'd either here or hence Why do you bend such solemn brows on me Think you I bear the shears of destiny Have I commandment on the pulse of life It is apparent foul play and ' tis shame That greatness should so grossly offer it So thrive it in your game and so farewell Stay yet Lord Salisbury I 'll go with thee And find th ' inheritance of this poor child His little kingdom of a forced grave That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle Three foot of it doth hold bad world the while This must not be thus borne this will break out To all our sorrows and ere long I doubt Exeunt LORDS They burn in indignation I repent There is no sure foundation set on blood No certain life achiev'd by others ' death From France to England Never such a pow'r For any foreign preparation Was levied in the body of a land The copy of your speed is learn'd by them For when you should be told they do prepare The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd O where hath our intelligence been drunk Where hath it slept Where is my mother 's care That such an army could be drawn in France And she not hear of it My liege her ear Is stopp'd with dust the first of April died Your noble mother and as I hear my lord The Lady Constance in a frenzy died Three days before but this from rumour 's tongue I idly heard if true or false I know not Withhold thy speed dreadful occasion O make a league with me till I have pleas'd My discontented peers What mother dead How wildly then walks my estate in France Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here Under the Dauphin Thou hast made me giddy With these in tidings But if you be afear'd to hear the worst Then let the worst unheard fall on your head Bear with me cousin for I was amaz'd Under the tide but now I breathe again Aloft the flood and can give audience To any tongue speak it of what it will How I have sped among the clergymen The sums I have collected shall express But as I travell'd hither through the land I find the people strangely fantasied Possess'd with rumours full of idle dreams Not knowing what they fear but full of fear And here 's a prophet that I brought with me From forth the streets of Pomfret whom I found With many hundreds treading on his heels To whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rhymes That ere the next Ascension day at noon Your Highness should deliver up your crown Thou idle dreamer wherefore didst thou so Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so Hubert away with him imprison him And on that day at noon whereon he says I shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd Deliver him to safety and return For I must use thee The French my lord men 's mouths are full of it Besides I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury With eyes as red as new enkindled fire And others more going to seek the grave Of Arthur whom they say is kill'd to night On your suggestion Gentle kinsman go And thrust thyself into their companies I have a way to will their loves again Bring them before me I Will seek them out Nay but make haste the better foot before O let me have no subject enemies When adverse foreigners affright my towns With dreadful pomp of stout invasion Be Mercury set feathers to thy heels And fly like thought from them to me again The spirit of the time shall teach me speed Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman With all my heart my liege Exit My mother dead My lord they say five moons were seen to night Four fixed and the fifth did whirl about The other four in wondrous motion Five moons Old men and beldams in the streets Do prophesy upon it dangerously Young Arthur 's death is common in their mouths And when they talk of him they shake their heads And whisper one another in the ear And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer 's wrist Whilst he that hears makes fearful action With wrinkled brows with nods with rolling eyes I saw a smith stand with his hammer thus The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool With open mouth swallowing a tailor 's news Who with his shears and measure in his hand Standing on slippers which his nimble haste Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet Told of a many thousand warlike French That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent Another lean unwash'd artificer Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur 's death Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur 's death Thy hand hath murd'red him I had a mighty cause To wish him dead but thou hadst none to kill him No had my lord Why did you not provoke me It is the curse of kings to be attended By slaves that take their humours for a warrant To break within the bloody house of life And on the winking of authority To understand a law to know the meaning Of dangerous majesty when perchance it frowns More upon humour than advis'd respect Here is your hand and seal for what I did O when the last account ' twixt heaven and earth Is to be made then shall this hand and seal Witness against us to damnation How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds Make deeds ill done Hadst not thou been by A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame This murder had not come into my mind But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect Finding thee fit for bloody villainy Apt liable to be employ'd in danger I faintly broke with thee of Arthur 's death And thou to be endeared to a king Made it no conscience to destroy a prince My lord- Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause When I spake darkly what I purposed Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face As bid me tell my tale in express words Deep shame had struck me dumb made me break off And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me But thou didst understand me by my signs And didst in signs again parley with sin Yea without stop didst let thy heart consent And consequently thy rude hand to act The deed which both our tongues held vile to name Out of my sight and never see me more My nobles leave me and my state is braved Even at my gates with ranks of foreign pow'rs Nay in the body of the fleshly land This kingdom this confine of blood and breath Hostility and civil tumult reigns Between my conscience and my cousin 's death Arm you against your other enemies I 'll make a peace between your soul and you Young Arthur is alive This hand of mine Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand Not painted with the crimson spots of blood Within this bosom never ent'red yet The dreadful motion of a murderous thought And you have slander'd nature in my form Which howsoever rude exteriorly Is yet the cover of a fairer mind Than to be butcher of an innocent child Doth Arthur live O haste thee to the peers Throw this report on their incensed rage And make them tame to their obedience Forgive the comment that my passion made Upon thy feature for my rage was blind And foul imaginary eyes of blood Presented thee more hideous than thou art O answer not but to my closet bring The angry lords with all expedient haste I conjure thee but slowly run more fast Exeunt The wall is high and yet will I leap down Good ground be pitiful and hurt me not There 's few or none do know me if they did This ship boy 's semblance hath disguis'd me quite I am afraid and yet I 'll venture it If I get down and do not break my limbs I 'll find a thousand shifts to get away As good to die and go as die and stay Leaps down O me my uncle 's spirit is in these stones Heaven take my soul and England keep my bones Dies Lords I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury It is our safety and we must embrace This gentle offer of the perilous time Who brought that letter from the Cardinal The Count Melun a noble lord of France Whose private with me of the Dauphin 's love Is much more general than these lines import To morrow morning let us meet him then Or rather then set forward for ' twill be Two long days ' journey lords or ere we meet Once more to day well met distemper'd lords The King by me requests your presence straight The King hath dispossess'd himself of us We will not line his thin bestained cloak With our pure honours nor attend the foot That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks Return and tell him so We know the worst Whate'er you think good words I think were best Our griefs and not our manners reason now But there is little reason in your grief Therefore ' twere reason you had manners now Sir sir impatience hath his privilege ' Tis true to hurt his master no man else This is the prison What is he lies here O death made proud with pure and princely beauty The earth had not a hole to hide this deed Murder as hating what himself hath done Doth lay it open to urge on revenge Or when he doom'd this beauty to a grave Found it too precious princely for a grave Sir Richard what think you Have you beheld Or have you read or heard or could you think Or do you almost think although you see That you do see Could thought without this object Form such another This is the very top The height the crest or crest unto the crest Of murder 's arms this is the bloodiest shame The wildest savagery the vilest stroke That ever wall ey'd wrath or staring rage Presented to the tears of soft remorse All murders past do stand excus'd in this And this so sole and so unmatchable Shall give a holiness a purity To the yet unbegotten sin of times And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest Exampled by this heinous spectacle It is a damned and a bloody work The graceless action of a heavy hand If that it be the work of any hand If that it be the work of any hand We had a kind of light what would ensue It is the shameful work of Hubert 's hand The practice and the purpose of the King From whose obedience I forbid my soul Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life And breathing to his breathless excellence The incense of a vow a holy vow Never to taste the pleasures of the world Never to be infected with delight Nor conversant with ease and idleness Till I have set a glory to this hand By giving it the worship of revenge and BIGOT Our souls religiously confirm thy words Lords I am hot with haste in seeking you Arthur doth live the King hath sent for you O he is bold and blushes not at death Avaunt thou hateful villain get thee gone I am no villain Must I rob the law Drawing his sword Your sword is bright sir put it up again Not till I sheathe it in a murderer 's skin Stand back Lord Salisbury stand back I say By heaven I think my sword 's as sharp as yours I would not have you lord forget yourself Nor tempt the danger of my true defence Lest I by marking of your rage forget Your worth your greatness and nobility Out dunghill Dar'st thou brave a nobleman Not for my life but yet I dare defend My innocent life against an emperor Thou art a murderer Do not prove me so Yet I am none Whose tongue soe'er speaks false Not truly speaks who speaks not truly lies Cut him to pieces Keep the peace I say Stand by or I shall gall you Faulconbridge Thou wert better gall the devil Salisbury If thou but frown on me or stir thy foot Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame I 'll strike thee dead Put up thy sword betime Or I 'll so maul you and your toasting iron That you shall think the devil is come from hell What wilt thou do renowned Faulconbridge Second a villain and a murderer Lord Bigot I am none Who kill'd this prince ' Tis not an hour since I left him well I honour'd him I lov'd him and will weep My date of life out for his sweet life 's loss Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes For villainy is not without such rheum And he long traded in it makes it seem Like rivers of remorse and innocency Away with me all you whose souls abhor Th ' uncleanly savours of a slaughter house For I am stifled with this smell of sin Away toward Bury to the Dauphin there There tell the King he may inquire us out Here 's a good world Knew you of this fair work Beyond the infinite and boundless reach Of mercy if thou didst this deed of death Art thou damn'd Hubert Do but hear me sir Ha I 'll tell thee what Thou'rt damn'd as black nay nothing is so black- Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell As thou shalt be if thou didst kill this child Upon my soul- If thou didst but consent To this most cruel act do but despair And if thou want'st a cord the smallest thread That ever spider twisted from her womb Will serve to strangle thee a rush will be a beam To hang thee on or wouldst thou drown thyself Put but a little water in a spoon And it shall be as all the ocean Enough to stifle such a villain up I do suspect thee very grievously If I in act consent or sin of thought Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath Which was embounded in this beauteous clay Let hell want pains enough to torture me I left him well Go bear him in thine arms I am amaz'd methinks and lose my way Among the thorns and dangers of this world How easy dost thou take all England up From forth this morsel of dead royalty The life the right and truth of all this realm Is fled to heaven and England now is left To tug and scamble and to part by th ' teeth The unowed interest of proud swelling state Now for the bare pick'd bone of majesty Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace Now powers from home and discontents at home Meet in one line and vast confusion waits As doth a raven on a sick fall'n beast The imminent decay of wrested pomp Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can Hold out this tempest Bear away that child And follow me with speed I 'll to the King A thousand businesses are brief in hand And heaven itself doth frown upon the land Exeunt Thus have I yielded up into your hand The circle of my glory Gives back the crown Take again From this my hand as holding of the Pope Your sovereign greatness and authority Now keep your holy word go meet the French And from his Holiness use all your power To stop their marches fore we are inflam'd Our discontented counties do revolt Our people quarrel with obedience Swearing allegiance and the love of soul To stranger blood to foreign royalty This inundation of mistemp'red humour Rests by you only to be qualified Then pause not for the present time 's so sick That present med'cine must be minist'red Or overthrow incurable ensues It was my breath that blew this tempest up Upon your stubborn usage of the Pope But since you are a gentle convertite My tongue shall hush again this storm of war And make fair weather in your blust'ring land On this Ascension day remember well Upon your oath of service to the Pope Go I to make the French lay down their arms Exit Is this Ascension day Did not the prophet Say that before Ascension day at noon My crown I should give off Even so I have I did suppose it should be on constraint But heaven be thank'd it is but voluntary All Kent hath yielded nothing there holds out But Dover Castle London hath receiv'd Like a kind host the Dauphin and his powers Your nobles will not hear you but are gone To offer service to your enemy And wild amazement hurries up and down The little number of your doubtful friends Would not my lords return to me again After they heard young Arthur was alive BASTARD They found him dead and cast into the streets An empty casket where the jewel of life By some damn'd hand was robbed and ta'en away That villain Hubert told me he did live So on my soul he did for aught he knew But wherefore do you droop Why look you sad Be great in act as you have been in thought Let not the world see fear and sad distrust Govern the motion of a kingly eye Be stirring as the time be fire with fire Threaten the threat'ner and outface the brow Of bragging horror so shall inferior eyes That borrow their behaviours from the great Grow great by your example and put on The dauntless spirit of resolution Away and glister like the god of war When he intendeth to become the field Show boldness and aspiring confidence What shall they seek the lion in his den And fright him there and make him tremble there O let it not be said Forage and run To meet displeasure farther from the doors And grapple with him ere he come so nigh The legate of the Pope hath been with me And I have made a happy peace with him And he hath promis'd to dismiss the powers Led by the Dauphin O inglorious league Shall we upon the footing of our land Send fair play orders and make compromise Insinuation parley and base truce To arms invasive Shall a beardless boy A cock'red silken wanton brave our fields And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil Mocking the air with colours idly spread And find no check Let us my liege to arms Perchance the Cardinal can not make your peace Or if he do let it at least be said They saw we had a purpose of defence Have thou the ordering of this present time Away then with good courage Yet I know Our party may well meet a prouder foe Exeunt My Lord Melun let this be copied out And keep it safe for our remembrance Return the precedent to these lords again That having our fair order written down Both they and we perusing o'er these notes May know wherefore we took the sacrament And keep our faiths firm and inviolable Upon our sides it never shall be broken And noble Dauphin albeit we swear A voluntary zeal and an unurg'd faith To your proceedings yet believe me Prince I am not glad that such a sore of time Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt And heal the inveterate canker of one wound By making many O it grieves my soul That I must draw this metal from my side To be a widow maker O and there Where honourable rescue and defence Cries out upon the name of Salisbury But such is the infection of the time That for the health and physic of our right We can not deal but with the very hand Of stern injustice and confused wrong And is't not pity O my grieved friends That we the sons and children of this isle Were born to see so sad an hour as this Wherein we step after a stranger march Upon her gentle bosom and fill up Her enemies ' ranks I must withdraw and weep Upon the spot of this enforced cause- To grace the gentry of a land remote And follow unacquainted colours here What here O nation that thou couldst remove That Neptune 's arms who clippeth thee about Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself And grapple thee unto a pagan shore Where these two Christian armies might combine The blood of malice in a vein of league And not to spend it so unneighbourly A noble temper dost thou show in this And great affections wrestling in thy bosom Doth make an earthquake of nobility O what a noble combat hast thou fought Between compulsion and a brave respect Let me wipe off this honourable dew That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks My heart hath melted at a lady 's tears Being an ordinary inundation But this effusion of such manly drops This show'r blown up by tempest of the soul Startles mine eyes and makes me more amaz'd Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven Figur'd quite o'er with burning meteors Lift up thy brow renowned Salisbury And with a great heart heave away this storm Commend these waters to those baby eyes That never saw the giant world enrag'd Nor met with fortune other than at feasts Full of warm blood of mirth of gossiping Come come for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep Into the purse of rich prosperity As Lewis himself So nobles shall you all That knit your sinews to the strength of mine Hail noble prince of France The next is this King John hath reconcil'd Himself to Rome his spirit is come in That so stood out against the holy Church The great metropolis and see of Rome Therefore thy threat'ning colours now wind up And tame the savage spirit of wild war That like a lion fostered up at hand It may lie gently at the foot of peace And be no further harmful than in show Your Grace shall pardon me I will not back I am too high born to be propertied To be a secondary at control Or useful serving man and instrument To any sovereign state throughout the world Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars Between this chastis'd kingdom and myself And brought in matter that should feed this fire And now ' tis far too huge to be blown out With that same weak wind which enkindled it You taught me how to know the face of right Acquainted me with interest to this land Yea thrust this enterprise into my heart And come ye now to tell me John hath made His peace with Rome What is that peace to me I by the honour of my marriage bed After young Arthur claim this land for mine And now it is half conquer'd must I back Because that John hath made his peace with Rome Am I Rome 's slave What penny hath Rome borne What men provided what munition sent To underprop this action Is ' t not I That undergo this charge Who else but I And such as to my claim are liable Sweat in this business and maintain this war Have I not heard these islanders shout out ' Vive le roi ' as I have bank'd their towns Have I not here the best cards for the game To will this easy match play'd for a crown And shall I now give o'er the yielded set No no on my soul it never shall be said You look but on the outside of this work Outside or inside I will not return Till my attempt so much be glorified As to my ample hope was promised Before I drew this gallant head of war And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world To outlook conquest and to will renown Even in the jaws of danger and of death According to the fair play of the world Let me have audience I am sent to speak My holy lord of Milan from the King I come to learn how you have dealt for him And as you answer I do know the scope And warrant limited unto my tongue The Dauphin is too wilful opposite And will not temporize with my entreaties He flatly says he 'll not lay down his arms By all the blood that ever fury breath'd The youth says well Now hear our English King For thus his royalty doth speak in me He is prepar'd and reason too he should This apish and unmannerly approach This harness'd masque and unadvised revel This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops The King doth smile at and is well prepar'd To whip this dwarfish war these pigmy arms From out the circle of his territories That hand which had the strength even at your door To cudgel you and make you take the hatch To dive like buckets in concealed wells To crouch in litter of your stable planks To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks To hug with swine to seek sweet safety out In vaults and prisons and to thrill and shake Even at the crying of your nation 's crow Thinking this voice an armed Englishman- Shall that victorious hand be feebled here That in your chambers gave you chastisement No Know the gallant monarch is in arms And like an eagle o'er his aery tow'rs To souse annoyance that comes near his nest And you degenerate you ingrate revolts You bloody Neroes ripping up the womb Of your dear mother England blush for shame For your own ladies and pale visag'd maids Like Amazons come tripping after drums Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change Their needles to lances and their gentle hearts To fierce and bloody inclination There end thy brave and turn thy face in peace We grant thou canst outscold us Fare thee well We hold our time too precious to be spent With such a brabbler Give me leave to speak No I will speak We will attend to neither Strike up the drums and let the tongue of war Plead for our interest and our being here Indeed your drums being beaten will cry out And so shall you being beaten Do but start And echo with the clamour of thy drum And even at hand a drum is ready brac'd That shall reverberate all as loud as thine Sound but another and another shall As loud as thine rattle the welkin 's ear And mock the deep mouth'd thunder for at hand- Not trusting to this halting legate here Whom he hath us'd rather for sport than need- Is warlike John and in his forehead sits A bare ribb'd death whose office is this day To feast upon whole thousands of the French Strike up our drums to find this danger out And thou shalt find it Dauphin do not doubt Exeunt How goes the day with us O tell me Hubert Badly I fear How fares your Majesty This fever that hath troubled me so long Lies heavy on me O my heart is sick My lord your valiant kinsman Faulconbridge Desires your Majesty to leave the field And send him word by me which way you go Tell him toward Swinstead to the abbey there Be of good comfort for the great supply That was expected by the Dauphin here Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands This news was brought to Richard but even now The French fight coldly and retire themselves Ay me this tyrant fever burns me up And will not let me welcome this good news Set on toward Swinstead to my litter straight Weakness possesseth me and I am faint Exeunt I did not think the King so stor'd with friends Up once again put spirit in the French If they miscarry we miscarry too That misbegotten devil Faulconbridge In spite of spite alone upholds the day They say King John sore sick hath left the field Lead me to the revolts of England here When we were happy we had other names It is the Count Melun Wounded to death Fly noble English you are bought and sold Unthread the rude eye of rebellion And welcome home again discarded faith Seek out King John and fall before his feet For if the French be lords of this loud day He means to recompense the pains you take By cutting off your heads Thus hath he sworn And I with him and many moe with me Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury Even on that altar where we swore to you Dear amity and everlasting love May this be possible May this be true Have I not hideous death within my view Retaining but a quantity of life Which bleeds away even as a form of wax Resolveth from his figure ' gainst the fire What in the world should make me now deceive Since I must lose the use of all deceit Why should I then be false since it is true That I must die here and live hence by truth I say again if Lewis do will the day He is forsworn if e'er those eyes of yours Behold another day break in the east But even this night whose black contagious breath Already smokes about the burning crest Of the old feeble and day wearied sun Even this ill night your breathing shall expire Paying the fine of rated treachery Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives If Lewis by your assistance win the day Commend me to one Hubert with your King The love of him and this respect besides For that my grandsire was an Englishman- Awakes my conscience to confess all this In lieu whereof I pray you bear me hence From forth the noise and rumour of the field Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts In peace and part this body and my soul With contemplation and devout desires We do believe thee and beshrew my soul But I do love the favour and the form Of this most fair occasion by the which We will untread the steps of damned flight And like a bated and retired flood Leaving our rankness and irregular course Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd And calmly run on in obedience Even to our ocean to great King John My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence For I do see the cruel pangs of death Right in thine eye Away my friends New flight And happy newness that intends old right The sun of heaven methought was loath to set But stay'd and made the western welkin blush When English measure backward their own ground In faint retire O bravely came we off When with a volley of our needless shot After such bloody toil we bid good night And wound our tott'ring colours clearly up Last in the field and almost lords of it Where is my prince the Dauphin Here what news The Count Melun is slain the English lords By his persuasion are again fall'n off And your supply which you have wish'd so long Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands Ah foul shrewd news Beshrew thy very heart I did not think to be so sad to night As this hath made me Who was he that said King John did fly an hour or two before The stumbling night did part our weary pow'rs Whoever spoke it it is true my lord keep good quarter and good care to night The day shall not be up so soon as I To try the fair adventure of to morrow Exeunt Who 's there Speak ho speak quickly or I shoot A friend What art thou Of the part of England Whither dost thou go What 's that to thee Why may I not demand Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine Hubert I think Thou hast a perfect thought I will upon all hazards well believe Thou art my friend that know'st my tongue so well Who art thou Who thou wilt And if thou please Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think I come one way of the Plantagenets Unkind remembrance thou and eyeless night Have done me shame Brave soldier pardon me That any accent breaking from thy tongue Should scape the true acquaintance of mine ear Come come sans compliment what news abroad Why here walk I in the black brow of night To find you out Brief then and what 's the news O my sweet sir news fitting to the night Black fearful comfortless and horrible Show me the very wound of this ill news I am no woman I 'll not swoon at it The King I fear is poison'd by a monk I left him almost speechless and broke out To acquaint you with this evil that you might The better arm you to the sudden time Than if you had at leisure known of this How did he take it who did taste to him A monk I tell you a resolved villain Whose bowels suddenly burst out The King Yet speaks and peradventure may recover Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty Why know you not The lords are all come back And brought Prince Henry in their company At whose request the King hath pardon'd them And they are all about his Majesty Withhold thine indignation mighty heaven And tempt us not to bear above our power I 'll tell thee Hubert half my power this night Passing these flats are taken by the tide- These Lincoln Washes have devoured them Myself well mounted hardly have escap'd Away before conduct me to the King I doubt he will be dead or ere I come Exeunt It is too late the life of all his blood Is touch'd corruptibly and his pure brain Which some suppose the soul 's frail dwelling house Doth by the idle comments that it makes Foretell the ending of mortality His Highness yet doth speak and holds belief That being brought into the open air It would allay the burning quality Of that fell poison which assaileth him Let him be brought into the orchard here Doth he still rage Exit BIGOT He is more patient Than when you left him even now he sung O vanity of sickness Fierce extremes In their continuance will not feel themselves Death having prey'd upon the outward parts Leaves them invisible and his siege is now Against the mind the which he pricks and wounds With many legions of strange fantasies Which in their throng and press to that last hold Confound themselves ' Tis strange that death should sing I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death And from the organ pipe of frailty sings His soul and body to their lasting rest Be of good comfort Prince for you are born To set a form upon that indigest Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude Ay marry now my soul hath elbow room It would not out at windows nor at doors There is so hot a summer in my bosom That all my bowels crumble up to dust I am a scribbled form drawn with a pen Upon a parchment and against this fire Do I shrink up How fares your Majesty Poison'd ill fare Dead forsook cast off And none of you will bid the winter come To thrust his icy fingers in my maw Nor let my kingdom 's rivers take their course Through my burn'd bosom nor entreat the north To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips And comfort me with cold I do not ask you much I beg cold comfort and you are so strait And so ingrateful you deny me that O that there were some virtue in my tears That might relieve you The salt in them is hot Within me is a hell and there the poison Is as a fiend confin'd to tyrannize On unreprievable condemned blood O I am scalded with my violent motion And spleen of speed to see your Majesty O cousin thou art come to set mine eye The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burnt And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail Are turned to one thread one little hair My heart hath one poor string to stay it by Which holds but till thy news be uttered And then all this thou seest is but a clod And module of confounded royalty The Dauphin is preparing hitherward Where God He knows how we shall answer him For in a night the best part of my pow'r As I upon advantage did remove Were in the Washes all unwarily Devoured by the unexpected flood The KING dies You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear My liege my lord But now a king now thus Even so must I run on and even so stop What surety of the world what hope what stay When this was now a king and now is clay Art thou gone so I do but stay behind To do the office for thee of revenge And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven As it on earth hath been thy servant still Now now you stars that move in your right spheres Where be your pow'rs Show now your mended faiths And instantly return with me again To push destruction and perpetual shame Out of the weak door of our fainting land Straight let us seek or straight we shall be sought The Dauphin rages at our very heels It seems you know not then so much as we The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin And brings from him such offers of our peace As we with honour and respect may take With purpose presently to leave this war He will the rather do it when he sees Ourselves well sinewed to our defence Nay ' tis in a manner done already For many carriages he hath dispatch'd To the sea side and put his cause and quarrel To the disposing of the Cardinal With whom yourself myself and other lords If you think meet this afternoon will post To consummate this business happily Let it be so And you my noble Prince With other princes that may best be spar'd Shall wait upon your father 's funeral At Worcester must his body be interr'd For so he will'd it Thither shall it then And happily may your sweet self put on The lineal state and glory of the land To whom with all submission on my knee I do bequeath my faithful services And true subjection everlastingly And the like tender of our love we make To rest without a spot for evermore I have a kind soul that would give you thanks And knows not how to do it but with tears O let us pay the time but needful woe Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs This England never did nor never shall Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror But when it first did help to wound itself Now these her princes are come home again Come the three corners of the world in arms And we shall shock them Nought shall make us rue If England to itself do rest but true Exeunt Hence home you idle creatures get you home Is this a holiday What know you not Being mechanical you ought not walk Upon a laboring day without the sign Of your profession Speak what trade art thou Why sir a carpenter Where is thy leather apron and thy rule What dost thou with thy best apparel on You sir what trade are you Truly sir in respect of a fine workman I am but as you would say a cobbler But what trade art thou Answer me directly A trade sir that I hope I may use with a safe conscience which is indeed sir a mender of bad soles What trade thou knave Thou naughty knave what trade Nay I beseech you sir be not out with me yet if you be out sir I can mend you What mean'st thou by that Mend me thou saucy fellow Why sir cobble you Thou art a cobbler art thou Truly Sir all that I live by is with the awl I meddle with no tradesman 's matters nor women 's matters but with awl I am indeed sir a surgeon to old shoes when they are in great danger I recover them As proper men as ever trod upon neat 's leather have gone upon my handiwork But wherefore art not in thy shop today Why dost thou lead these men about the streets Truly sir to wear out their shoes to get myself into more work But indeed sir we make holiday to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph Wherefore rejoice What conquest brings he home What tributaries follow him to Rome To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels You blocks you stones you worse than senseless things O you hard hearts you cruel men of Rome Knew you not Pompey Many a time and oft Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements To towers and windows yea to chimney tops Your infants in your arms and there have sat The livelong day with patient expectation To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome And when you saw his chariot but appear Have you not made an universal shout That Tiber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds Made in her concave shores And do you now put on your best attire And do you now cull out a holiday And do you now strew flowers in his way That comes in triumph over Pompey 's blood Be gone Run to your houses fall upon your knees Pray to the gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this ingratitude Go go good countrymen and for this fault Assemble all the poor men of your sort Draw them to Tiber banks and weep your tears Into the channel till the lowest stream Do kiss the most exalted shores of all May we do so You know it is the feast of Lupercal It is no matter let no images Be hung with Caesar 's trophies I 'll about And drive away the vulgar from the streets So do you too where you perceive them thick These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar 's wing Will make him fly an ordinary pitch Who else would soar above the view of men And keep us all in servile fearfulness Exeunt Calpurnia Peace ho Caesar speaks Calpurnia Here my lord Stand you directly in Antonio 's way When he doth run his course Antonio Caesar my lord Forget not in your speed Antonio To touch Calpurnia for our elders say The barren touched in this holy chase Shake off their sterile curse I shall remember When Caesar says Do this it is perform'd Set on and leave no ceremony out Flourish Caesar Ha Who calls Bid every noise be still Peace yet again Who is it in the press that calls on me I hear a tongue shriller than all the music Cry Caesar Speak Caesar is turn'd to hear Beware the ides of March What man is that A soothsayer you beware the ides of March Set him before me let me see his face Fellow come from the throng look upon Caesar What say'st thou to me now Speak once again Beware the ides of March He is a dreamer let us leave him Pass Will you go see the order of the course Not I. I pray you do I am not gamesome I do lack some part Of that quick spirit that is in Antony Let me not hinder Cassius your desires I 'll leave you Brutus I do observe you now of late I have not from your eyes that gentleness And show of love as I was wo nt to have You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand Over your friend that loves you Cassius Be not deceived if I have veil'd my look I turn the trouble of my countenance Merely upon myself Vexed I am Of late with passions of some difference Conceptions only proper to myself Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors But let not therefore my good friends be grieved- Among which number Cassius be you one- Nor construe any further my neglect Than that poor Brutus with himself at war Forgets the shows of love to other men Then Brutus I have much mistook your passion By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value worthy cogitations Tell me good Brutus can you see your face No Cassius for the eye sees not itself But by reflection by some other things ' Tis just And it is very much lamented Brutus That you have no such mirrors as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your eye That you might see your shadow I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome Except immortal Caesar speaking of Brutus And groaning underneath this age 's yoke Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes Into what dangers would you lead me Cassius That you would have me seek into myself For that which is not in me Therefore good Brutus be prepared to hear And since you know you can not see yourself So well as by reflection I your glass Will modestly discover to yourself That of yourself which you yet know not of And be not jealous on me gentle Brutus Were I a common laugher or did use To stale with ordinary oaths my love To every new protester if you know That I do fawn on men and hug them hard And after scandal them or if you know That I profess myself in banqueting To all the rout then hold me dangerous What means this shouting I do fear the people Choose Caesar for their king Ay do you fear it Then must I think you would not have it so I would not Cassius yet I love him well But wherefore do you hold me here so long What is it that you would impart to me If it be aught toward the general good Set honor in one eye and death i ' the other And I will look on both indifferently For let the gods so speed me as I love The name of honor more than I fear death I know that virtue to be in you Brutus As well as I do know your outward favor Well honor is the subject of my story I can not tell what you and other men Think of this life but for my single self I had as lief not be as live to be In awe of such a thing as I myself I was born free as Caesar so were you We both have fed as well and we can both Endure the winter 's cold as well as he For once upon a raw and gusty day The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores Caesar said to me Darest thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry flood And swim to yonder point Upon the word Accoutred as I was I plunged in And bade him follow So indeed he did The torrent roar'd and we did buffet it With lusty sinews throwing it aside And stemming it with hearts of controversy But ere we could arrive the point proposed Caesar cried Help me Cassius or I sink I as Aeneas our great ancestor Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder The old Anchises bear so from the waves of Tiber Did I the tired Caesar And this man Is now become a god and Cassius is A wretched creature and must bend his body If Caesar carelessly but nod on him He had a fever when he was in Spain And when the fit was on him I did mark How he did shake ' Tis true this god did shake His coward lips did from their color fly And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world Did lose his luster I did hear him groan Ay and that tongue of his that bade the Romans Mark him and write his speeches in their books Alas it cried Give me some drink Titinius As a sick girl Ye gods It doth amaze me A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the majestic world And bear the palm alone Shout Flourish Another general shout I do believe that these applauses are For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar Why man he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus and we petty men Walk under his huge legs and peep about To find ourselves dishonorable graves Men at some time are masters of their fates The fault dear Brutus is not in our stars But in ourselves that we are underlings Brutus and Caesar what should be in that Caesar Why should that name be sounded more than yours Write them together yours is as fair a name Sound them it doth become the mouth as well Weigh them it is as heavy conjure with 'em Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar Now in the names of all the gods at once Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great Age thou art shamed Rome thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods When went there by an age since the great flood But it was famed with more than with one man When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome That her wide walls encompass'd but one man Now is it Rome indeed and room enough When there is in it but one only man O you and I have heard our fathers say There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king That you do love me I am nothing jealous What you would work me to I have some aim How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter for this present I would not so with love I might entreat you Be any further moved What you have said I will consider what you have to say I will with patience hear and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things Till then my noble friend chew upon this Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus The games are done and Caesar is returning As they pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve And he will after his sour fashion tell you What hath proceeded worthy note today I will do so But look you Cassius The angry spot doth glow on Caesar 's brow And all the rest look like a chidden train Calpurnia 's cheek is pale and Cicero Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes As we have seen him in the Capitol Being cross'd in conference by some senators Casca will tell us what the matter is Antonio Caesar Let me have men about me that are fat Sleek headed men and such as sleep o ' nights Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look He thinks too much such men are dangerous Fear him not Caesar he 's not dangerous He is a noble Roman and well given Would he were fatter But I fear him not Yet if my name were liable to fear I do not know the man I should avoid So soon as that spare Cassius He reads much He is a great observer and he looks Quite through the deeds of men He loves no plays As thou dost Antony he hears no music Seldom he smiles and smiles in such a sort As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit That could be moved to smile at anything Such men as he be never at heart 's ease Whiles they behold a greater than themselves And therefore are they very dangerous I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd Than what I fear for always I am Caesar Come on my right hand for this ear is deaf And tell me truly what thou think'st of him You pull'd me by the cloak would you speak with me Ay Casca tell us what hath chanced today That Caesar looks so sad Why you were with him were you not I should not then ask Casca what had chanced Why there was a crown offered him and being offered him What was the second noise for Why for that too They shouted thrice What was the last cry for Why for that too Was the crown offered him thrice Ay marry wast and he put it by thrice every time gentler than other and at every putting by mine honest neighbors shouted Who offered him the crown Why Antony Tell us the manner of it gentle Casca I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it It was mere foolery I did not mark it I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown yet ' twas not a crown neither ' twas one of these coronets and as I told you he put it by once But for all that to my thinking he would fain have had it Then he offered it to him again then he put it by again But to my thinking he was very loath to lay his fingers off it And then he offered it the third time he put it the third time by and still as he refused it the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped hands and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar for he swounded and fell down at it And for mine own part I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air But soft I pray you what did Caesars wound He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and was speechless ' Tis very like He hath the falling sickness No Caesar hath it not but you and I And honest Casca we have the falling sickness I know not what you mean by that but I am sure Caesar fell down If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him according as he pleased and displeased them as they use to do the players in the theatre I am no true man What said he when he came unto himself Marry before he fell down when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown he plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his throat to cut An had been a man of any occupation if I would not have taken him at a word I would I might go to hell among the rogues And so he fell When he came to himself again he said if he had done or said anything amiss he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity Three or four wenches where I stood cried Alas good soul and forgave him with all their hearts But there 's no heed to be taken of them if Caesar had stabbed their mothers they would have done no less And after that he came thus sad away Ay Did Cicero say anything Ay he spoke Greek To what effect Nay an I tell you that I 'll ne'er look you i ' the face again but those that understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads but for mine own part it was Greek to me I could tell you more news too Marullus and Flavius for pulling scarfs off Caesar 's images are put to silence Fare you well There was more foolery yet if could remember it Will you sup with me tonight Casca No I am promised forth Will you dine with me tomorrow Ay if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner worth the eating Good I will expect you Do so farewell both Exit What a blunt fellow is this grown to be He was quick mettle when he went to school So is he now in execution Of any bold or noble enterprise However he puts on this tardy form This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit Which gives men stomach to digest his words With better appetite And so it is For this time I will leave you Tomorrow if you please to speak with me I will come home to you or if you will Come home to me and I will wait for you I will do so Till then think of the world Good even Casca Brought you Caesar home Why are you breathless and why stare you so Are not you moved when all the sway of earth Shakes like a thing unfirm O Cicero I have seen tempests when the scolding winds Have rived the knotty oaks and I have seen The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam To be exalted with the threatening clouds But never till tonight never till now Did I go through a tempest dropping fire Either there is a civil strife in heaven Or else the world too saucy with the gods Incenses them to send destruction Why saw you anything more wonderful A common slave- you know him well by sight- Held up his left hand which did flame and burn Like twenty torches join'd and yet his hand Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd Besides- I ha ' not since put up my sword- Against the Capitol I met a lion Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by Without annoying me And there were drawn Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women Transformed with their fear who swore they saw Men all in fire walk up and down the streets And yesterday the bird of night did sit Even at noonday upon the marketplace Howling and shrieking When these prodigies Do so conjointly meet let not men say These are their reasons they are natural For I believe they are portentous things Unto the climate that they point upon Indeed it is a strange disposed time But men may construe things after their fashion Clean from the purpose of the things themselves Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow He doth for he did bid Antonio Send word to you he would be there tomorrow Good then Casca This disturbed sky Is not to walk in Farewell Cicero Exit Cicero Who 's there A Roman Casca by your voice Your ear is good Cassius what night is this A very pleasing night to honest men Who ever knew the heavens menace so Those that have known the earth so full of faults For my part I have walk'd about the streets Submitting me unto the perilous night And thus unbraced Casca as you see Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open The breast of heaven I did present myself Even in the aim and very flash of it But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens It is the part of men to fear and tremble When the most mighty gods by tokens send Such dreadful heralds to astonish us You are dull Casca and those sparks of life That should be in a Roman you do want Or else you use not You look pale and gaze And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder To see the strange impatience of the heavens But if you would consider the true cause Why all these fires why all these gliding ghosts Why birds and beasts from quality and kind Why old men fools and children calculate Why all these things change from their ordinance Their natures and preformed faculties To monstrous quality why you shall find That heaven hath infused them with these spirits To make them instruments of fear and warning Unto some monstrous state Now could I Casca name to thee a man Most like this dreadful night That thunders lightens opens graves and roars As doth the lion in the Capitol A man no mightier than thyself or me In personal action yet prodigious grown And fearful as these strange eruptions are ' Tis Caesar that you mean is it not Cassius Let it be who it is for Romans now Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors But woe the while Our fathers ' minds are dead And we are govern'd with our mothers ' spirits Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish Indeed they say the senators tomorrow Mean to establish Caesar as a king And he shall wear his crown by sea and land In every place save here in Italy I know where I will wear this dagger then Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius Therein ye gods you make the weak most strong Therein ye gods you tyrants do defeat Nor stony tower nor walls of beaten brass Nor airless dungeon nor strong links of iron Can be retentive to the strength of spirit But life being weary of these worldly bars Never lacks power to dismiss itself If I know this know all the world besides That part of tyranny that I do bear I can shake off at pleasure Thunder still So can I. So every bondman in his own hand bears The power to cancel his captivity And why should Caesar be a tyrant then Poor man I know he would not be a wolf But that he sees the Romans are but sheep He were no lion were not Romans hinds Those that with haste will make a mighty fire Begin it with weak straws What trash is Rome What rubbish and what offal when it serves For the base matter to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar But O grief Where hast thou led me I perhaps speak this Before a willing bondman then I know My answer must be made But I am arm'd And dangers are to me indifferent You speak to Casca and to such a man That is no fleering tell tale Hold my hand Be factious for redress of all these griefs And I will set this foot of mine as far As who goes farthest There 's a bargain made Now know you Casca I have moved already Some certain of the noblest minded Romans To undergo with me an enterprise Of honorable dangerous consequence And I do know by this they stay for me In Pompey 's Porch For now this fearful night There is no stir or walking in the streets And the complexion of the element In favor 's like the work we have in hand Most bloody fiery and most terrible Stand close awhile for here comes one in haste ' Tis Cinna I do know him by his gait He is a friend Cinna where haste you so To find out you Who 's that Metellus Cimber No it is Casca one incorporate To our attempts Am I not stay'd for Cinna I am glad on't What a fearful night is this There 's two or three of us have seen strange sights Am I not stay'd for Tell me Yes you are O Cassius if you could But win the noble Brutus to our party- Be you content Good Cinna take this paper And look you lay it in the praetor 's chair Where Brutus may but find it and throw this In at his window set this up with wax Upon old Brutus ' statue All this done Repair to Pompey 's Porch where you shall find us Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there All but Metellus Cimber and he 's gone To seek you at your house Well I will hie And so bestow these papers as you bade me That done repair to Pompey 's Theatre O he sits high in all the people 's hearts And that which would appear offense in us His countenance like richest alchemy Will change to virtue and to worthiness Him and his worth and our great need of him You have right well conceited Let us go For it is after midnight and ere day We will awake him and be sure of him Exeunt What Lucius ho I can not by the progress of the stars Give guess how near to day Lucius I say I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly When Lucius when Awake I say What Lucius Call'd you my lord Get me a taper in my study Lucius When it is lighted come and call me here I will my lord Exit It must be by his death and for my part I know no personal cause to spurn at him But for the general He would be crown'd How that might change his nature there 's the question It is the bright day that brings forth the adder And that craves wary walking Crown him that And then I grant we put a sting in him That at his will he may do danger with The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins Remorse from power and to speak truth of Caesar I have not known when his affections sway'd More than his reason But ' tis a common proof That lowliness is young ambition 's ladder Whereto the climber upward turns his face But when he once attains the upmost round He then unto the ladder turns his back Looks in the clouds scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend So Caesar may Then lest he may prevent And since the quarrel Will bear no color for the thing he is Fashion it thus that what he is augmented Would run to these and these extremities And therefore think him as a serpent 's egg Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous And kill him in the shell The taper burneth in your closet sir Searching the window for a flint I found This paper thus seal'd up and I am sure It did not lie there when I went to bed Get you to bed again it is not day Is not tomorrow boy the ides of March I know not sir Look in the calendar and bring me word I will sir Exit The exhalations whizzing in the air Give so much light that I may read by them Sir March is wasted fifteen days ' Tis good Go to the gate somebody knocks Sir ' tis your brother Cassius at the door Who doth desire to see you Is he alone No sir there are more with him Do you know them No sir their hats are pluck'd about their ears And half their faces buried in their cloaks That by no means I may discover them By any mark of favor Let 'em enter Exit Lucius They are the faction O Conspiracy Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night When evils are most free O then by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage Seek none Conspiracy Hide it in smiles and affability For if thou path thy native semblance on Not Erebus itself were dim enough To hide thee from prevention I think we are too bold upon your rest Good morrow Brutus do we trouble you I have been up this hour awake all night Know I these men that come along with you Yes every man of them and no man here But honors you and every one doth wish You had but that opinion of yourself Which every noble Roman bears of you This is Trebonius He is welcome hither This Decius Brutus He is welcome too They are all welcome What watchful cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your eyes and night Shall I entreat a word They whisper Here lies the east Doth not the day break here No O pardon sir it doth and yongrey lines That fret the clouds are messengers of day You shall confess that you are both deceived Here as I point my sword the sun arises Which is a great way growing on the south Weighing the youthful season of the year Some two months hence up higher toward the north He first presents his fire and the high east Stands as the Capitol directly here Give me your hands all over one by one And let us swear our resolution No not an oath If not the face of men The sufferance of our souls the time 's abuse- If these be motives weak break off betimes And every man hence to his idle bed So let high sighted tyranny range on Till each man drop by lottery But if these As I am sure they do bear fire enough To kindle cowards and to steel with valor The melting spirits of women then countrymen What need we any spur but our own cause To prick us to redress What other bond Than secret Romans that have spoke the word And will not palter And what other oath Than honesty to honesty engaged That this shall be or we will fall for it Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls That welcome wrongs unto bad causes swear Such creatures as men doubt but do not stain The even virtue of our enterprise Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits To think that or our cause or our performance Did need an oath when every drop of blood That every Roman bears and nobly bears Is guilty of a several bastardy If he do break the smallest particle Of any promise that hath pass'd from him But what of Cicero Shall we sound him I think he will stand very strong with us Let us not leave him out No by no means O let us have him for his silver hairs Will purchase us a good opinion And buy men 's voices to commend our deeds It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear But all be buried in his gravity O name him not let us not break with him For he will never follow anything That other men begin Then leave him out Indeed he is not fit Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar Decius well urged I think it is not meet Mark Antony so well beloved of Caesar Should outlive Caesar We shall find of him A shrewd contriver and you know his means If he improve them may well stretch so far As to annoy us all which to prevent Let Antony and Caesar fall together Our course will seem too bloody Caius Cassius To cut the head off and then hack the limbs Like wrath in death and envy afterwards For Antony is but a limb of Caesar Let us be sacrificers but not butchers Caius We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar And in the spirit of men there is no blood O that we then could come by Caesar 's spirit And not dismember Caesar But alas Caesar must bleed for it And gentle friends Let 's kill him boldly but not wrathfully Let 's carve him as a dish fit for the gods Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds And let our hearts as subtle masters do Stir up their servants to an act of rage And after seem to chide 'em This shall make Our purpose necessary and not envious Which so appearing to the common eyes We shall be call'd purgers not murderers And for Mark Antony think not of him For he can do no more than Caesar 's arm When Caesar 's head is off Yet I fear him For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar- Alas good Cassius do not think of him If he love Caesar all that he can do Is to himself take thought and die for Caesar And that were much he should for he is given To sports to wildness and much company There is no fear in him let him not die For he will live and laugh at this hereafter Peace count the clock The clock hath stricken three ' Tis time to part But it is doubtful yet Whether Caesar will come forth today or no For he is superstitious grown of late Quite from the main opinion he held once Of fantasy of dreams and ceremonies It may be these apparent prodigies The unaccustom'd terror of this night And the persuasion of his augurers May hold him from the Capitol today Never fear that If he be so resolved I can o'ersway him for he loves to hear That unicorns may be betray'd with trees And bears with glasses elephants with holes Lions with toils and men with flatterers But when I tell him he hates flatterers He says he does being then most flattered Let me work For I can give his humor the true bent And I will bring him to the Capitol Nay we will all of us be there to fetch him By the eighth hour Is that the utter most Be that the uttermost and fail not then Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey I wonder none of you have thought of him Now good Metellus go along by him He loves me well and I have given him reasons Send him but hither and I 'll fashion him The morning comes upon ' s. We 'll leave you Brutus And friends disperse yourselves but all remember What you have said and show yourselves true Romans Good gentlemen look fresh and merrily Let not our looks put on our purposes But bear it as our Roman actors do With untired spirits and formal constancy And so good morrow to you every one Brutus my lord Portia what mean you Wherefore rise you now It is not for your health thus to commit Your weak condition to the raw cold morning Nor for yours neither have ungently Brutus Stole from my bed and yesternight at supper You suddenly arose and walk'd about Musing and sighing with your arms across And when I ask'd you what the matter was You stared upon me with ungentle looks I urged you further then you scratch'd your head And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot Yet I insisted yet you answer'd not But with an angry waiter of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you So I did Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem'd too much enkindled and withal Hoping it was but an effect of humor Which sometime hath his hour with every man It will not let you eat nor talk nor sleep And could it work so much upon your shape As it hath much prevail'd on your condition I should not know you Brutus Dear my lord Make me acquainted with your cause of grief I am not well in health and that is all Brutus is wise and were he not in health He would embrace the means to come by it Why so I do Good Portia go to bed Is Brutus sick and is it physical To walk unbraced and suck up the humors Of the dank morning What is Brutus sick And will he steal out of his wholesome bed To dare the vile contagion of the night And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air To add unto his sickness No my Brutus You have some sick offense within your mind Which by the right and virtue of my place I ought to know of and upon my knees I charm you by my once commended beauty By all your vows of love and that great vow Which did incorporate and make us one That you unfold to me yourself your half Why you are heavy and what men tonight Have had resort to you for here have been Some six or seven who did hide their faces Even from darkness Kneel not gentle Portia I should not need if you were gentle Brutus Within the bond of marriage tell me Brutus Is it excepted I should know no secrets That appertain to you Am I yourself But as it were in sort or limitation To keep with you at meals comfort your bed And talk to you sometimes Dwell I but in the suburbs Of your good pleasure If it be no more Portia is Brutus ' harlot not his wife You are my true and honorable wife As dear to me as are the ruddy drops That visit my sad heart If this were true then should I know this secret I grant I am a woman but withal A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife I grant I am a woman but withal A woman well reputed Cato 's daughter Think you I am no stronger than my sex Being so father'd and so husbanded Tell me your counsels I will not disclose 'em I have made strong proof of my constancy Giving myself a voluntary wound Here in the thigh Can I bear that with patience And not my husband 's secrets O ye gods Render me worthy of this noble wife Knocking within Hark hark one knocks Portia go in awhile And by and by thy bosom shall partake The secrets of my heart All my engagements I will construe to thee All the charactery of my sad brows Leave me with haste Exit Portia Lucius who 's that knocks Here is a sick man that would speak with you Caius Ligarius that Metellus spake of Boy stand aside Caius Ligarius how Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue O what a time have you chose out brave Caius To wear a kerchief Would you were not sick I am not sick if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honor Such an exploit have I in hand Ligarius Had you a healthful ear to hear of it By all the gods that Romans bow before I here discard my sickness Soul of Rome Brave son derived from honorable loins Thou like an exorcist hast conjured up My mortified spirit Now bid me run And I will strive with things impossible Yea get the better of them What 's to do A piece of work that will make sick men whole But are not some whole that we must make sick That must we also What it is my Caius I shall unfold to thee as we are going To whom it must be done Set on your foot And with a heart new fired I follow you To do I know not what but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on Follow me then Exeunt Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out Help ho They murther Caesar Who 's within My lord Go bid the priests do present sacrifice And bring me their opinions of success I will my lord Exit What mean you Caesar Think you to walk forth You shall not stir out of your house today Caesar shall forth the things that threaten'd me Ne'er look'd but on my back when they shall see The face of Caesar they are vanished Caesar I I stood on ceremonies Yet now they fright me There is one within Besides the things that we have heard and seen Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch A lioness hath whelped in the streets And graves have yawn'd and yielded up their dead Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds In ranks and squadrons and right form of war Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol The noise of battle hurtled in the air Horses did neigh and dying men did groan And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets O Caesar These things are beyond all use And I do fear them What can be avoided Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods Yet Caesar shall go forth for these predictions Are to the world in general as to Caesar When beggars die there are no comets seen The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes Cowards die many times before their deaths The valiant never taste of death but once Of all the wonders that I yet have heard It seems to me most strange that men should fear Seeing that death a necessary end Will come when it will come They would not have you to stir forth today Plucking the entrails of an offering forth They could not find a heart within the beast The gods do this in shame of cowardice Caesar should be a beast without a heart If he should stay at home today for fear No Caesar shall not Danger knows full well That Caesar is more dangerous than he We are two lions litter'd in one day And I the elder and more terrible And Caesar shall go forth Alas my lord Your wisdom is consumed in confidence Do not go forth today Call it my fear That keeps you in the house and not your own We 'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House And he shall say you are not well today Let me upon my knee prevail in this Mark Antony shall say I am not well And for thy humor I will stay at home Caesar all hail Good morrow worthy Caesar I come to fetch you to the Senate House And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the senators And tell them that I will not come today Can not is false and that I dare not falser I will not come today Tell them so Decius Say he is sick Shall Caesar send a lie Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth Decius go tell them Caesar will not come Most mighty Caesar let me know some cause Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so The cause is in my will I will not come That is enough to satisfy the Senate But for your private satisfaction Because I love you I will let you know Calpurnia here my wife stays me at home She dreamt tonight she saw my statue Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood and many lusty Romans Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent and on her knee Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today This dream is all amiss interpreted It was a vision fair and fortunate Your statue spouting blood in many pipes In which so many smiling Romans bathed Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood and that great men shall press For tinctures stains relics and cognizance This by Calpurnia 's dream is signified And this way have you well expounded it I have when you have heard what I can say And know it now the Senate have concluded To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar If you shall send them word you will not come Their minds may change Besides it were a mock Apt to be render'd for someone to say Break up the Senate till another time When Caesar 's wife shall meet with better dreams If Caesar hide himself shall they not whisper Lo Caesar is afraid Pardon me Caesar for my dear dear love To your proceeding bids me tell you this And reason to my love is liable How foolish do your fears seem now Calpurnia I am ashamed I did yield to them Give me my robe for I will go Good morrow Caesar Welcome Publius What Brutus are you stirr'd so early too Good morrow Casca Caius Ligarius Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy As that same ague which hath made you lean What is't o'clock Caesar ' tis strucken eight I thank you for your pains and courtesy So to most noble Caesar Bid them prepare within I am to blame to be thus waited for Now Cinna now Metellus what Trebonius I have an hour 's talk in store for you Remember that you call on me today Be near me that I may remember you Caesar I will Aside And so near will I be That your best friends shall wish I had been further Good friends go in and taste some wine with me And we like friends will straightway go together Aside That every like is not the same O Caesar The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon Exeunt Caesar beware of Brutus take heed of Cassius come not near Casca have an eye to Cinna trust not Trebonius mark well Metellus Cimber Decius Brutus loves thee not thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius There is but one mind in all these men and it is bent against Caesar If thou beest not immortal look about you Security gives way to conspiracy The mighty gods defend thee I prithee boy run to the Senate House Stay not to answer me but get thee gone Why dost thou stay To know my errand madam I would have had thee there and here again Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there O constancy be strong upon my side Set a huge mountain ' tween my heart and tongue I have a man 's mind but a woman 's might How hard it is for women to keep counsel Art thou here yet Madam what should I do Run to the Capitol and nothing else And so return to you and nothing else Yes bring me word boy if thy lord look well For he went sickly forth and take good note What Caesar doth what suitors press to him Hark boy what noise is that I hear none madam Prithee listen well I heard a bustling rumor like a fray And the wind brings it from the Capitol Sooth madam I hear nothing Come hither fellow Which way hast thou been At mine own house good lady What is't o'clock About the ninth hour lady Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol Madam not yet I go to take my stand To see him pass on to the Capitol Thou hast some suit to Caesar hast thou not That I have lady If it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar as to hear me I shall beseech him to befriend himself Why know'st thou any harm 's intended towards him None that I know will be much that I fear may chance Good morrow to you Here the street is narrow The throng that follows Caesar at the heels Of senators of praetors common suitors Will crowd a feeble man almost to death I 'll get me to a place more void and there Speak to great Caesar as he comes along Exit I must go in Ay me how weak a thing The heart of woman is O Brutus The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise Sure the boy heard me Brutus hath a suit That Caesar will not grant O I grow faint Run Lucius and commend me to my lord Say I am merry Come to me again And bring me word what he doth say to thee The ides of March are come Ay Caesar but not gone Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read At your best leisure this his humble suit O Caesar read mine first for mine 's a suit That touches Caesar nearer Read it great Caesar What touches us ourself shall be last served Delay not Caesar read it instantly What is the fellow mad Sirrah give place What urge you your petitions in the street Come to the Capitol I wish your enterprise today may thrive What enterprise Popilius Fare you well What said Popilius Lena He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive I fear our purpose is discovered Look how he makes to Caesar Mark him Casca Be sudden for we fear prevention Brutus what shall be done If this be known Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back For I will slay myself Cassius be constant Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes For look he smiles and Caesar doth not change Trebonius knows his time for look you Brutus He draws Mark Antony out of the way Where is Metellus Cimber Let him And presently prefer his suit to Caesar He is address'd press near and second him Casca you are the first that rears your hand Are we all ready What is now amiss That Caesar and his Senate must redress Most high most mighty and most puissant Caesar Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat An humble heart Kneels I must prevent thee Cimber These couchings and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men And turn preordinance and first decree Into the law of children Be not fond To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood That will be thaw'd from the true quality With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words Low crooked court'sies and base spaniel fawning Thy brother by decree is banished If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him I spurn thee like a cur out of my way Know Caesar doth not wrong nor without cause Will he be satisfied Is there no voice more worthy than my own To sound more sweetly in great Caesar 's ear For the repealing of my banish'd brother I kiss thy hand but not in flattery Caesar Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may Have an immediate freedom of repeal What Brutus Pardon Caesar Caesar pardon As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber I could be well moved if I were as you If I could pray to move prayers would move me But I am constant as the northern star Of whose true fix'd and resting quality There is no fellow in the firmament The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks They are all fire and every one doth shine But there 's but one in all doth hold his place So in the world ' tis furnish'd well with men And men are flesh and blood and apprehensive Yet in the number I do know but one That unassailable holds on his rank Unshaked of motion and that I am he Let me a little show it even in this That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd And constant do remain to keep him so O Caesar- Hence Wilt thou lift up Olympus Great Caesar- Doth not Brutus bootless kneel Speak hands for me Et tu Brute?- Then fall Caesar Dies Liberty Freedom Tyranny is dead Run hence proclaim cry it about the streets Some to the common pulpits and cry out Liberty freedom and enfranchisement People and senators be not affrighted Fly not stand still ambition 's debt is paid Go to the pulpit Brutus And Cassius too Where 's Publius Here quite confounded with this mutiny Stand fast together lest some friend of Caesar 's Should chance- Talk not of standing Publius good cheer There is no harm intended to your person Nor to no Roman else So tell them Publius And leave us Publius lest that the people Rushing on us should do your age some mischief Do so and let no man abide this deed But we the doers Where is Antony Fled to his house amazed Men wives and children stare cry out and run As it were doomsday Fates we will know your pleasures That we shall die we know ' tis but the time And drawing days out that men stand upon Why he that cuts off twenty years of life Cuts off so many years of fearing death Grant that and then is death a benefit So are we Caesar 's friends that have abridged His time of fearing death Stoop Romans stoop And let us bathe our hands in Caesar 's blood Up to the elbows and besmear our swords Then walk we forth even to the marketplace And waving our red weapons o'er our heads Let 's all cry Peace freedom and liberty Stoop then and wash How many ages hence Shall this our lofty scene be acted over In states unborn and accents yet unknown How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport That now on Pompey 's basis lies along No worthier than the dust So oft as that shall be So often shall the knot of us be call'd The men that gave their country liberty What shall we forth Ay every man away Brutus shall lead and we will grace his heels With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome Soft who comes here A friend of Antony 's Thus Brutus did my master bid me kneel Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down And being prostrate thus he bade me say Brutus is noble wise valiant and honest Caesar was mighty bold royal and loving Say I love Brutus and I honor him Say I fear'd Caesar honor'd him and loved him If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him and be resolved How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state With all true faith So says my master Antony Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman I never thought him worse Tell him so please him come unto this place He shall be satisfied and by my honor Depart untouch'd I 'll fetch him presently Exit I know that we shall have him well to friend I wish we may but yet have I a mind That fears him much and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the purpose But here comes Antony Welcome Mark Antony O mighty Caesar Dost thou lie so low Are all thy conquests glories triumphs spoils Shrunk to this little measure Fare thee well I know not gentlemen what you intend Who else must be let blood who else is rank If I myself there is no hour so fit As Caesar 's death 's hour nor no instrument Of half that worth as those your swords made rich With the most noble blood of all this world I do beseech ye if you bear me hard Now whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke Fulfill your pleasure Live a thousand years I shall not find myself so apt to die No place will please me so no means of death As here by Caesar and by you cut off The choice and master spirits of this age O Antony beg not your death of us Though now we must appear bloody and cruel As by our hands and this our present act You see we do yet see you but our hands And this the bleeding business they have done Our hearts you see not they are pitiful And pity to the general wrong of Rome- As fire drives out fire so pity pity- Hath done this deed on Caesar For your part To you our swords have leaden points Mark Antony Our arms in strength of malice and our hearts Of brothers ' temper do receive you in With all kind love good thoughts and reverence Your voice shall be as strong as any man 's In the disposing of new dignities Only be patient till we have appeased The multitude beside themselves with fear And then we will deliver you the cause Why I that did love Caesar when I struck him Have thus proceeded I doubt not of your wisdom Let each man render me his bloody hand First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand Now Decius Brutus yours now yours Metellus Yours Cinna and my valiant Casca yours Though last not least in love yours good Trebonius Gentlemen all- alas what shall I say My credit now stands on such slippery ground That one of two bad ways you must conceit me Either a coward or a flatterer That I did love thee Caesar O ' tis true If then thy spirit look upon us now Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death To see thy Antony making his peace Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes Most noble In the presence of thy corse Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood It would become me better than to close In terms of friendship with thine enemies Pardon me Julius Here wast thou bay'd brave hart Here didst thou fall and here thy hunters stand Sign'd in thy spoil and crimson'd in thy Lethe O world thou wast the forest to this hart And this indeed O world the heart of thee How like a deer strucken by many princes Dost thou here lie Mark Antony- Pardon me Caius Cassius The enemies of Caesar shall say this Then in a friend it is cold modesty I blame you not for praising Caesar so But what compact mean you to have with us Will you be prick'd in number of our friends Or shall we on and not depend on you Therefore I took your hands but was indeed Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar Friends am I with you all and love you all Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous Or else were this a savage spectacle Our reasons are so full of good regard That were you Antony the son of Caesar You should be satisfied That 's all I seek And am moreover suitor that I may Produce his body to the marketplace And in the pulpit as becomes a friend Speak in the order of his funeral You shall Mark Antony Brutus a word with you Aside to Brutus You know not what you do Do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral Know you how much the people may be moved By that which he will utter By your pardon I will myself into the pulpit first And show the reason of our Caesar 's death What Antony shall speak I will protest He speaks by leave and by permission And that we are contented Caesar shall Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies It shall advantage more than do us wrong I know not what may fall I like it not Mark Antony here take you Caesar 's body You shall not in your funeral speech blame us But speak all good you can devise of Caesar And say you do't by our permission Else shall you not have any hand at all About his funeral And you shall speak In the same pulpit whereto I am going After my speech is ended Be it so I do desire no more Prepare the body then and follow us O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth That I am meek and gentle with these butchers Thou art the ruins of the noblest man That ever lived in the tide of times Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood Over thy wounds now do I prophesy Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue A curse shall light upon the limbs of men Domestic fury and fierce civil strife Shall cumber all the parts of Italy Blood and destruction shall be so in use And dreadful objects so familiar That mothers shall but smile when they behold Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war All pity choked with custom of fell deeds And Caesar 's spirit ranging for revenge With Ate by his side come hot from hell Shall in these confines with a monarch 's voice Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war That this foul deed shall smell above the earth With carrion men groaning for burial I do Mark Antony Caesar did write for him to come to Rome He did receive his letters and is coming And bid me say to you by word of mouth- O Caesar Sees the body Thy heart is big get thee apart and weep Passion I see is catching for mine eyes Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine Began to water Is thy master coming He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced Here is a mourning Rome a dangerous Rome No Rome of safety for Octavius yet Hie hence and tell him so Yet stay awhile Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace There shall I try In my oration how the people take The cruel issue of these bloody men According to the which thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things Lend me your hand Exeunt with Caesar 's body We will be satisfied Let us be satisfied Then follow me and give me audience friends Cassius go you into the other street And part the numbers Those that will hear me speak let 'em stay here Those that will follow Cassius go with him And public reasons shall be rendered Of Caesar 's death I will hear Brutus speak I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons When severally we hear them rendered The noble Brutus is ascended Silence Be patient till the last Romans countrymen and lovers Hear me for my cause and be silent that you may hear Believe me for mine honor and have respect to mine honor that you may believe Censure me in your wisdom and awake your senses that you may the better judge If there be any in this assembly any dear friend of Caesar 's to him I say that Brutus ' love to Caesar was no less than his If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar this is my answer Not that I loved Caesar less but that I loved Rome more Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves than that Caesar were dead to live all freemen As Caesar loved me I weep for him as he was fortunate I rejoice at it as he was valiant I honor him but as he was ambitious I slew him There is tears for his love joy for his fortune honor for his valor and death for his ambition Who is here so base that would be a bondman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman If any speak for him have I offended Who is here so vile that will not love his country If any speak for him have I offended I pause for a reply None Brutus none Then none have I offended I have done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus The question of his death is enrolled in the Capitol his glory not extenuated wherein he was worthy nor his offenses enforced for which he suffered death Live Brutus live live Bring him with triumph home unto his house Give him a statue with his ancestors Let him be Caesar Caesar 's better parts Shall be crown'd in Brutus We 'll bring him to his house with shouts and clamors My countrymen- Peace Silence Brutus speaks Peace ho Good countrymen let me depart alone And for my sake stay here with Antony Do grace to Caesar 's corse and grace his speech Tending to Caesar 's glories which Mark Antony By our permission is allow'd to make I do entreat you not a man depart Save I alone till Antony have spoke Exit Stay ho and let us hear Mark Antony Let him go up into the public chair We 'll hear him Noble Antony go up For Brutus ' sake I am beholding to you What does he say of Brutus He says for Brutus ' sake He finds himself beholding to us all ' Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here This Caesar was a tyrant Nay that 's certain We are blest that Rome is rid of him Peace Let us hear what Antony can say You gentle Romans- Peace ho Let us hear him Friends Romans countrymen lend me your ears I come to bury Caesar not to praise him The evil that men do lives after them The good is oft interred with their bones So let it be with Caesar The noble Brutus Hath told you Caesar was ambitious If it were so it was a grievous fault And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it Here under leave of Brutus and the rest- For Brutus is an honorable man So are they all all honorable men- Come I to speak in Caesar 's funeral He was my friend faithful and just to me But Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man He hath brought many captives home to Rome Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill Did this in Caesar seem ambitious When that the poor have cried Caesar hath wept Ambition should be made of sterner stuff Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And Brutus is an honorable man You all did see that on the Lupercal I thrice presented him a kingly crown Which he did thrice refuse Was this ambition Yet Brutus says he was ambitious And sure he is an honorable man I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke But here I am to speak what I do know You all did love him once not without cause What cause withholds you then to mourn for him O judgement thou art fled to brutish beasts And men have lost their reason Bear with me My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar And I must pause till it come back to me Methinks there is much reason in his sayings If thou consider rightly of the matter Caesar has had great wrong Has he masters I fear there will a worse come in his place Mark'd ye his words He would not take the crown Therefore ' tis certain he was not ambitious If it be found so some will dear abide it Poor soul his eyes are red as fire with weeping There 's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony Now mark him he begins again to speak But yesterday the word of Caesar might Have stood against the world Now lies he there And none so poor to do him reverence O masters If I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong Who you all know are honorable men I will not do them wrong I rather choose To wrong the dead to wrong myself and you Than I will wrong such honorable men But here 's a parchment with the seal of Caesar I found it in his closet ' tis his will Let but the commons hear this testament- Which pardon me I do not mean to read- And they would go and kiss dead Caesar 's wounds And dip their napkins in his sacred blood Yea beg a hair of him for memory And dying mention it within their wills Bequeathing it as a rich legacy Unto their issue We 'll hear the will Read it Mark Antony The will the will We will hear Caesar 's will Have patience gentle friends I must not read it It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you You are not wood you are not stones but men And being men hearing the will of Caesar It will inflame you it will make you mad ' Tis good you know not that you are his heirs For if you should O what would come of it Read the will we 'll hear it Antony You shall read us the will Caesar 's will Will you be patient Will you stay awhile I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it I fear I wrong the honorable men Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar I do fear it They were traitors Honorable men The will The testament They were villains murtherers The will Read the will You will compel me then to read the will Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar And let me show you him that made the will Shall I descend And will you give me leave Come down Descend You shall have leave A ring stand round Stand from the hearse stand from the body Room for Antony most noble Antony Nay press not so upon me stand far off Stand back room bear back If you have tears prepare to shed them now You all do know this mantle I remember The first time ever Caesar put it on ' Twas on a summer 's evening in his tent That day he overcame the Nervii Look in this place ran Cassius ' dagger through See what a rent the envious Casca made Through this the well beloved Brutus stabb'd And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it As rushing out of doors to be resolved If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no For Brutus as you know was Caesar 's angel Judge O you gods how dearly Caesar loved him This was the most unkindest cut of all For when the noble Caesar saw him stab Ingratitude more strong than traitors ' arms Quite vanquish'd him Then burst his mighty heart And in his mantle muffling up his face Even at the base of Pompey 's statue Which all the while ran blood great Caesar fell O what a fall was there my countrymen Then I and you and all of us fell down Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us O now you weep and I perceive you feel The dint of pity These are gracious drops Kind souls what weep you when you but behold Our Caesar 's vesture wounded Look you here Here is himself marr'd as you see with traitors O piteous spectacle O noble Caesar O woeful day O traitors villains O most bloody sight We will be revenged Revenge About Seek Burn Fire Kill Slay Let not a traitor live Stay countrymen Peace there Hear the noble Antony We 'll hear him we 'll follow him we 'll die with him Good friends sweet friends let me not stir you up To such a sudden flood of mutiny They that have done this deed are honorable What private griefs they have alas I know not That made them do it They are wise and honorable And will no doubt with reasons answer you I come not friends to steal away your hearts I am no orator as Brutus is But as you know me all a plain blunt man That love my friend and that they know full well That gave me public leave to speak of him For I have neither wit nor words nor worth Action nor utterance nor the power of speech To stir men 's blood I only speak right on I tell you that which you yourselves do know Show you sweet Caesar 's wounds poor dumb mouths And bid them speak for me But were I Brutus And Brutus Antony there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny We 'll mutiny We 'll burn the house of Brutus Away then Come seek the conspirators Yet hear me countrymen yet hear me speak Peace ho Hear Antony most noble Antony Why friends you go to do you know not what Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves Alas you know not I must tell you then You have forgot the will I told you of Most true the will Let 's stay and hear the will Here is the will and under Caesar 's seal To every Roman citizen he gives To every several man seventy five drachmas Most noble Caesar We 'll revenge his death O royal Caesar Hear me with patience Peace ho Moreover he hath left you all his walks His private arbors and new planted orchards On this side Tiber he hath left them you And to your heirs forever- common pleasures To walk abroad and recreate yourselves Here was a Caesar When comes such another Never never Come away away We 'll burn his body in the holy place And with the brands fire the traitors ' houses Take up the body Go fetch fire Pluck down benches Pluck down forms windows anything Now let it work Mischief thou art afoot Take thou what course thou wilt Sir Octavius is already come to Rome Where is he He and Lepidus are at Caesar 's house And thither will I straight to visit him He comes upon a wish Fortune is merry And in this mood will give us anything I heard him say Brutus and Cassius Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome Be like they had some notice of the people How I had moved them Bring me to Octavius Exeunt I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar And things unluckily charge my fantasy I have no will to wander forth of doors Yet something leads me forth What is your name Whither are you going Where do you dwell Are you a married man or a bachelor Answer every man directly Ay and briefly Ay and wisely Ay and truly you were best What is my name Whither am I going Where do I dwell Am I a married man or a bachelor Then to answer every man directly and briefly wisely and truly wisely I say I am a bachelor That 's as much as to say they are fools that marry You 'll bear me a bang for that I fear Proceed directly Directly I am going to Caesar 's funeral As a friend or an enemy As a friend That matter is answered directly For your dwelling briefly Briefly I dwell by the Capitol Your name sir truly Truly my name is Cinna Tear him to pieces he 's a conspirator I am Cinna the poet I am Cinna the poet Tear him for his bad verses tear him for his bad verses I am not Cinna the conspirator It is no matter his name 's Cinna Pluck but his name out of his heart and turn him going Tear him tear him Come brands ho firebrands To Brutus ' to Cassius ' burn all Some to Decius ' house and some to Casca 's some to Ligarius ' Away go Exeunt These many then shall die their names are prick'd Your brother too must die consent you Lepidus I do consent- Prick him down Antony Upon condition Publius shall not live Who is your sister 's son Mark Antony He shall not live look with a spot I damn him But Lepidus go you to Caesar 's house Fetch the will hither and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in legacies What shall I find you here Or here or at the Capitol Exit Lepidus This is a slight unmeritable man Meet to be sent on errands Is it fit The three fold world divided he should stand One of the three to share it So you thought him And took his voice who should be prick'd to die In our black sentence and proscription Octavius I have seen more days than you And though we lay these honors on this man To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold To groan and sweat under the business Either led or driven as we point the way And having brought our treasure where we will Then take we down his load and turn him off Like to the empty ass to shake his ears And graze in commons You may do your will But he 's a tried and valiant soldier So is my horse Octavius and for that I do appoint him store of provender It is a creature that I teach to fight To wind to stop to run directly on His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit And in some taste is Lepidus but so He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth A barren spirited fellow one that feeds On objects arts and imitations Which out of use and staled by other men Begin his fashion Do not talk of him But as a property And now Octavius Listen great things Brutus and Cassius Are levying powers we must straight make head Therefore let our alliance be combined Our best friends made our means stretch'd And let us presently go sit in council How covert matters may be best disclosed And open perils surest answered Let us do so for we are at the stake And bay'd about with many enemies And some that smile have in their hearts I fear Millions of mischiefs Exeunt Stand ho Give the word ho and stand What now Lucilius is Cassius near He is at hand and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his master He greets me well Your master Pindarus In his own change or by ill officers Hath given me some worthy cause to wish Things done undone but if he be at hand I shall be satisfied I do not doubt But that my noble master will appear Such as he is full of regard and honor He is not doubted A word Lucilius How he received you Let me be resolved With courtesy and with respect enough But not with such familiar instances Nor with such free and friendly conference As he hath used of old Thou hast described A hot friend cooling Ever note Lucilius When love begins to sicken and decay It useth an enforced ceremony There are no tricks in plain and simple faith But hollow men like horses hot at hand Make gallant show and promise of their mettle But when they should endure the bloody spur They fall their crests and like deceitful jades Sink in the trial Comes his army on They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd The greater part the horse in general Are come with Cassius Low march within Hark he is arrived March gently on to meet him Stand ho Stand ho Speak the word along Stand Stand Stand Most noble brother you have done me wrong Judge me you gods Wrong I mine enemies And if not so how should I wrong a brother Brutus this sober form of yours hides wrongs And when you do them- Cassius be content Speak your griefs softly I do know you well Before the eyes of both our armies here Which should perceive nothing but love from us Let us not wrangle Bid them move away Then in my tent Cassius enlarge your griefs And I will give you audience Pindarus Bid our commanders lead their charges off A little from this ground Lucilius do you the like and let no man Come to our tent till we have done our conference Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door Exeunt That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes here of the Sardians Wherein my letters praying on his side Because I knew the man were slighted off You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case In such a time as this it is not meet That every nice offense should bear his comment Let me tell you Cassius you yourself Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm To sell and mart your offices for gold To undeservers I an itching palm You know that you are Brutus that speaks this Or by the gods this speech were else your last The name of Cassius honors this corruption And chastisement doth therefore hide his head Chastisement Remember March the ides of March remember Did not great Julius bleed for justice ' sake What villain touch'd his body that did stab And not for justice What shall one of us That struck the foremost man of all this world But for supporting robbers shall we now Contaminate our fingers with base bribes And sell the mighty space of our large honors For so much trash as may be grasped thus I had rather be a dog and bay the moon Than such a Roman Brutus bait not me I 'll not endure it You forget yourself To hedge me in I am a soldier I Older in practice abler than yourself To make conditions Go to you are not Cassius I am I say you are not Urge me no more I shall forget myself Have mind upon your health tempt me no farther Away slight man Is't possible Hear me for I will speak Must I give way and room to your rash choler Shall I be frighted when a madman stares O gods ye gods Must I endure all this All this Ay more Fret till your proud heart break Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble Must I bouge Must I observe you Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor By the gods You shall digest the venom of your spleen Though it do split you for from this day forth I 'll use you for my mirth yea for my laughter When you are waspish Is it come to this You say you are a better soldier Let it appear so make your vaunting true And it shall please me well For mine own part I shall be glad to learn of noble men You wrong me every way you wrong me Brutus I said an elder soldier not a better Did I say better If you did I care not When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me Peace peace You durst not so have tempted him I durst not No What durst not tempt him For your life you durst not Do not presume too much upon my love I may do that I shall be sorry for You have done that you should be sorry for There is no terror Cassius in your threats For I am arm'd so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind Which I respect not I did send to you For certain sums of gold which you denied me For I can raise no money by vile means By heaven I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection I did send To you for gold to pay my legions Which you denied me Was that done like Cassius Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends Be ready gods with all your thunderbolts Dash him to pieces I denied you not You did I did not He was but a fool That brought my answer back Brutus hath rived my heart A friend should bear his friend 's infirmities But Brutus makes mine greater than they are I do not till you practise them on me You love me not I do not like your faults A friendly eye could never see such faults A flatterer 's would not though they do appear As huge as high Olympus Come Antony and young Octavius come Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius For Cassius is aweary of the world Hated by one he loves braved by his brother Check'd like a bondman all his faults observed Set in a notebook learn'd and conn'd by rote To cast into my teeth O I could weep My spirit from mine eyes There is my dagger And here my naked breast within a heart Dearer than Pluto 's mine richer than gold If that thou best a Roman take it forth I that denied thee gold will give my heart Strike as thou didst at Caesar for I know When thou didst hate him worst thou lovedst him better Than ever thou lovedst Cassius Sheathe your dagger Be angry when you will it shall have scope Do what you will dishonor shall be humor O Cassius you are yoked with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire Who much enforced shows a hasty spark And straight is cold again Hath Cassius lived To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus When grief and blood ill temper'd vexeth him When I spoke that I was ill temper'd too Do you confess so much Give me your hand And my heart too O Brutus What 's the matter Have not you love enough to bear with me When that rash humor which my mother gave me Makes me forgetful Yes Cassius and from henceforth When you are overearnest with your Brutus He 'll think your mother chides and leave you so Within Let me go in to see the generals There is some grudge between 'em ' tis not meet They be alone Within You shall not come to them Within Nothing but death shall stay me How now what 's the matter For shame you generals What do you mean Love and be friends as two such men should be For I have seen more years I 'm sure than ye Ha ha How vilely doth this cynic rhyme Get you hence sirrah saucy fellow hence Bear with him Brutus ' tis his fashion I 'll know his humor when he knows his time What should the wars do with these jigging fools Companion hence Away away be gone Exit Poet Lucilius and Titinius bid the commanders Prepare to lodge their companies tonight And come yourselves and bring Messala with you Immediately to us Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius Lucius a bowl of wine Exit Lucius I did not think you could have been so angry O Cassius I am sick of many griefs Of your philosophy you make no use If you give place to accidental evils No man bears sorrow better Portia is dead Ha Portia She is dead How ' scaped killing when I cross'd you so O insupportable and touching loss Upon what sickness Impatient of my absence And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony Have made themselves so strong- for with her death That tidings came- with this she fell distract And her attendants absent swallow'd fire And died so Even so O ye immortal gods Speak no more of her Give me a bowl of wine In this I bury all unkindness Cassius Drinks My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge Come in Titinius Exit Lucius Portia art thou gone No more I pray you Messala I have here received letters That young Octavius and Mark Antony Come down upon us with a mighty power Bending their expedition toward Philippi Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure With what addition That by proscription and bills of outlawry Octavius Antony and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred senators There in our letters do not well agree Mine speak of seventy senators that died By their proscriptions Cicero being one Cicero one Cicero is dead And by that order of proscription Had you your letters from your wife my lord No Messala Nor nothing in your letters writ of her Nothing Messala That methinks is strange Why ask you Hear you aught of her in yours No my lord Now as you are a Roman tell me true Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell For certain she is dead and by strange manner Why farewell Portia We must die Messala With meditating that she must die once I have the patience to endure it now Even so great men great losses should endure I have as much of this in art as you But yet my nature could not bear it so Well to our work alive What do you think Of marching to Philippi presently I do not think it good Your reason This it is ' Tis better that the enemy seek us So shall he waste his means weary his soldiers Doing himself offense whilst we lying still Are full of rest defense and nimbleness Good reasons must of force give place to better The people ' twixt Philippi and this ground Do stand but in a forced affection For they have grudged us contribution The enemy marching along by them By them shall make a fuller number up Come on refresh'd new added and encouraged From which advantage shall we cut him off If at Philippi we do face him there These people at our back Hear me good brother Under your pardon You must note beside That we have tried the utmost of our friends Our legions are brim full our cause is ripe The enemy increaseth every day We at the height are ready to decline There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune Omitted all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries On such a full sea are we now afloat And we must take the current when it serves Or lose our ventures Then with your will go on We 'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi The deep of night is crept upon our talk And nature must obey necessity Which we will niggard with a little rest There is no more to say No more Good night Early tomorrow will we rise and hence Lucius O my dear brother This was an ill beginning of the night Never come such division ' tween our souls Let it not Brutus Everything is well Good night my lord Good night good brother MESSALA Good night Lord Brutus Farewell everyone Here in the tent What thou speak'st drowsily Poor knave I blame thee not thou art o'erwatch'd Call Claudio and some other of my men I 'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent Varro and Claudio Calls my lord I pray you sirs lie in my tent and sleep It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my brother Cassius So please you we will stand and watch your pleasure I would not have it so Lie down good sirs It may be I shall otherwise bethink me Look Lucius here 's the book I sought for so I put it in the pocket of my gown I was sure your lordship did not give it me Bear with me good boy I am much forgetful Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile And touch thy instrument a strain or two Ay my lord an't please you It does my boy I trouble thee too much but thou art willing It is my duty sir I should not urge thy duty past thy might I know young bloods look for a time of rest I have slept my lord already It was well done and thou shalt sleep again I will not hold thee long If I do live I will be good to thee Music and a song This is a sleepy tune O murtherous slumber Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy That plays thee music Gentle knave good night I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee If thou dost nod thou break'st thy instrument I 'll take it from thee and good boy good night Let me see let me see is not the leaf turn'd down Where I left reading Here it is I think Sits down Thy evil spirit Brutus Why comest thou To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi Well then I shall see thee again Ay at Philippi Why I will see thee at Philippi then Exit Ghost Now I have taken heart thou vanishest Ill spirit I would hold more talk with thee Boy Lucius Varro Claudio Sirs awake Claudio The strings my lord are false He thinks he still is at his instrument Lucius awake My lord Didst thou dream Lucius that thou so criedst out My lord I do not know that I did cry Yes that thou didst Didst thou see anything Nothing my lord Sleep again Lucius Sirrah Claudio To Varro Fellow thou awake My lord My lord Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep CLAUDIO Did we my lord Ay saw you anything No my lord I saw nothing Nor I my lord Go and commend me to my brother Cassius Bid him set on his powers betimes before And we will follow CLAUDIO It shall be done my lord Exeunt Now Antony our hopes are answered You said the enemy would not come down But keep the hills and upper regions It proves not so Their battles are at hand They mean to warn us at Philippi here Answering before we do demand of them Tut I am in their bosoms and I know Wherefore they do it They could be content To visit other places and come down With fearful bravery thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage But ' tis not so Prepare you generals The enemy comes on in gallant show Their bloody sign of battle is hung out And something to be done immediately Octavius lead your battle softly on Upon the left hand of the even field Upon the right hand I keep thou the left Why do you cross me in this exigent I do not cross you but I will do so They stand and would have parley Stand fast Titinius we must out and talk Mark Antony shall we give sign of battle No Caesar we will answer on their charge Make forth the generals would have some words Stir not until the signal not until the signal Words before blows Is it so countrymen Not that we love words better as you do Good words are better than bad strokes Octavius In your bad strokes Brutus you give good words Witness the hole you made in Caesar 's heart Crying Long live Hail Caesar Antony The posture of your blows are yet unknown But for your words they rob the Hybla bees And leave them honeyless Not stingless too O yes and soundless too For you have stol'n their buzzing Antony And very wisely threat before you sting Villains You did not so when your vile daggers Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar You show'd your teeth like apes and fawn'd like hounds And bow'd like bondmen kissing Caesar 's feet Whilst damned Casca like a cur behind Strooke Caesar on the neck O you flatterers Flatterers Now Brutus thank yourself This tongue had not offended so today If Cassius might have ruled Come come the cause If arguing make us sweat The proof of it will turn to redder drops Look I draw a sword against conspirators When think you that the sword goes up again Never till Caesar 's three and thirty wounds Be well avenged or till another Caesar Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors Caesar thou canst not die by traitors ' hands Unless thou bring'st them with thee So I hope I was not born to die on Brutus ' sword O if thou wert the noblest of thy strain Young man thou couldst not die more honorable A peevish school boy worthless of such honor Join'd with a masker and a reveler Old Cassius still Come Antony away Defiance traitors hurl we in your teeth If you dare fight today come to the field If not when you have stomachs Why now blow and swell billow and swim bark The storm is up and all is on the hazard Ho Lucilius Hark a word with you Stands forth My lord Messala Stands forth What says my general Messala This is my birthday as this very day Was Cassius born Give me thy hand Messala Be thou my witness that against my will As Pompey was am I compell'd to set Upon one battle all our liberties You know that I held Epicurus strong And his opinion Now I change my mind And partly credit things that do presage Coming from Sardis on our former ensign Two mighty eagles fell and there they perch'd Gorging and feeding from our soldiers ' hands Who to Philippi here consorted us This morning are they fled away and gone And in their steads do ravens crows and kites Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us As we were sickly prey Their shadows seem A canopy most fatal under which Our army lies ready to give up the ghost Believe not so I but believe it partly For I am fresh of spirit and resolved To meet all perils very constantly Even so Lucilius Now most noble Brutus The gods today stand friendly that we may Lovers in peace lead on our days to age But since the affairs of men rest still incertain Let 's reason with the worst that may befall If we do lose this battle then is this The very last time we shall speak together What are you then determined to do Even by the rule of that philosophy By which I did blame Cato for the death Which he did give himself- I know not how But I do find it cowardly and vile For fear of what might fall so to prevent The time of life- arming myself with patience To stay the providence of some high powers That govern us below Then if we lose this battle You are contented to be led in triumph Thorough the streets of Rome No Cassius no Think not thou noble Roman That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome He bears too great a mind But this same day Must end that work the ides of March begun And whether we shall meet again I know not Therefore our everlasting farewell take Forever and forever farewell Cassius If we do meet again why we shall smile If not why then this parting was well made Forever and forever farewell Brutus If we do meet again we 'll smile indeed If not ' tis true this parting was well made Why then lead on O that a man might know The end of this day 's business ere it come But it sufficeth that the day will end And then the end is known Come ho Away Exeunt Ride ride Messala ride and give these bills Unto the legions on the other side Loud alarum Let them set on at once for I perceive But cold demeanor in Octavia 's wing And sudden push gives them the overthrow Ride ride Messala Let them all come down Exeunt O look Titinius look the villains fly Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy This ensign here of mine was turning back I slew the coward and did take it from him O Cassius Brutus gave the word too early Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly His soldiers fell to spoil Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed Fly further off my lord fly further off Mark Antony is in your tents my lord Fly therefore noble Cassius fly far off This hill is far enough Look look Titinius Are those my tents where I perceive the fire They are my lord Titinius if thou lovest me Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops And here again that I may rest assured Whether yond troops are friend or enemy I will be here again even with a thought Exit Go Pindarus get higher on that hill My sight was ever thick regard Titinius And tell me what thou notest about the field Above O my lord What news Above Titinius is enclosed round about With horsemen that make to him on the spur Yet he spurs on Now they are almost on him Now Titinius Now some light O he lights too He 's ta'en Shout And hark They shout for joy Come down behold no more O coward that I am to live so long To see my best friend ta'en before my face So I am free yet would not so have been Durst I have done my will O Cassius Far from this country Pindarus shall run Where never Roman shall take note of him Exit It is but change Titinius for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus ' power As Cassius ' legions are by Antony These tidings would well comfort Cassius Where did you leave him All disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hill Is not that he that lies upon the ground He lies not like the living O my heart Is not that he No this was he Messala But Cassius is no more O setting sun As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night So in his red blood Cassius ' day is set The sun of Rome is set Our day is gone Clouds dews and dangers come our deeds are done Mistrust of my success hath done this deed Mistrust of good success hath done this deed O hateful error melancholy 's child Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not O error soon conceived Thou never comest unto a happy birth But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee What Pindarus Where art thou Pindarus Seek him Titinius whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his ears I may say thrusting it For piercing steel and darts envenomed Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus As tidings of this sight Hie you Messala And I will seek for Pindarus the while Exit Messala Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius Did I not meet thy friends And did not they Put on my brows this wreath of victory And bid me give it thee Didst thou not hear their shouts Alas thou hast misconstrued everything But hold thee take this garland on thy brow Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding Brutus come apace And see how I regarded Caius Cassius By your leave gods this is a Roman 's part Come Cassius ' sword and find Titinius ' heart Where where Messala doth his body lie Lo yonder and Titinius mourning it Titinius ' face is upward He is slain O Julius Caesar thou art mighty yet Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords In our own proper entrails Low alarums Brave Titinius Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius Are yet two Romans living such as these The last of all the Romans fare thee well It is impossible that ever Rome Should breed thy fellow Friends I owe moe tears To this dead man than you shall see me pay I shall find time Cassius I shall find time Come therefore and to Thasos send his body His funerals shall not be in our camp Lest it discomfort us Lucilius come And come young Cato let us to the field Labio and Flavio set our battles on ' Tis three o'clock and Romans yet ere night We shall try fortune in a second fight Exeunt Yet countrymen O yet hold up your heads What bastard doth not Who will go with me I will proclaim my name about the field I am the son of Marcus Cato ho A foe to tyrants and my country 's friend I am the son of Marcus Cato ho And I am Brutus Marcus Brutus I Brutus my country 's friend know me for Brutus Exit O young and noble Cato art thou down Why now thou diest as bravely as Titinius And mayst be honor'd being Cato 's son Yield or thou diest Only I yield to die Offers money There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight Kill Brutus and be honor'd in his death We must not A noble prisoner Room ho Tell Antony Brutus is ta'en I 'll tell the news Here comes the general Where is he Safe Antony Brutus is safe enough I dare assure thee that no enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus The gods defend him from so great a shame When you do find him or alive or dead He will be found like Brutus like himself This is not Brutus friend but I assure you A prize no less in worth Keep this man safe Give him all kindness I had rather have Such men my friends than enemies Go on And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead And bring us word unto Octavius ' tent How everything is chanced Exeunt Come poor remains of friends rest on this rock Statilius show'd the torchlight but my lord He came not back He is or ta'en or slain Sit thee down Clitus Slaying is the word It is a deed in fashion Hark thee Clitus Whispers What I my lord No not for all the world Peace then no words I 'll rather kill myself Hark thee Dardanius Whispers Shall I do such a deed O Dardanius O Clitus What ill request did Brutus make to thee To kill him Clitus Look he meditates Now is that noble vessel full of grief That it runs over even at his eyes Come hither good Volumnius list a word What says my lord Why this Volumnius The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me Two several times by night at Sardis once And this last night here in Philippi fields I know my hour is come Not so my lord Nay I am sure it is Volumnius Thou seest the world Volumnius how it goes Our enemies have beat us to the pit Low alarums It is more worthy to leap in ourselves Than tarry till they push us Good Volumnius Thou know'st that we two went to school together Even for that our love of old I prithee Hold thou my sword hilts whilst I run on it That 's not an office for a friend my lord Fly fly my lord there is no tarrying here Farewell to you and you and you Volumnius Strato thou hast been all this while asleep Farewell to thee too Strato Countrymen My heart doth joy that yet in all my life I found no man but he was true to me I shall have glory by this losing day More than Octavius and Mark Antony By this vile conquest shall attain unto So fare you well at once for Brutus ' tongue Hath almost ended his life 's history Night hangs upon mine eyes my bones would rest That have but labor'd to attain this hour Fly my lord fly Hence I will follow Give me your hand first Fare you well my lord Farewell good Strato Runs on his sword Caesar now be still I kill'd not thee with half so good a will Dies What man is that My master 's man Strato where is thy master Free from the bondage you are in Messala The conquerors can but make a fire of him For Brutus only overcame himself And no man else hath honor by his death So Brutus should be found I thank thee Brutus That thou hast proved Lucilius ' saying true All that served Brutus I will entertain them Fellow wilt thou bestow thy time with me Ay if Messala will prefer me to you Do so good Messala How died my master Strato I held the sword and he did run on it Octavius then take him to follow thee That did the latest service to my master This was the noblest Roman of them all All the conspirators save only he Did that they did in envy of great Caesar He only in a general honest thought And common good to all made one of them His life was gentle and the elements So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up And say to all the world This was a man According to his virtue let us use him With all respect and rites of burial Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie Most like a soldier ordered honorably So call the field to rest and let 's away To part the glories of this happy day Exeunt Let fame that all hunt after in their lives Live regist'red upon our brazen tombs And then grace us in the disgrace of death When spite of cormorant devouring Time Th ' endeavour of this present breath may buy That honour which shall bate his scythe 's keen edge And make us heirs of all eternity Therefore brave conquerors- for so you are That war against your own affections And the huge army of the world 's desires- Our late edict shall strongly stand in force Navarre shall be the wonder of the world Our court shall be a little Academe Still and contemplative in living art You three Berowne Dumain and Longaville Have sworn for three years ' term to live with me My fellow scholars and to keep those statutes That are recorded in this schedule here Your oaths are pass'd and now subscribe your names That his own hand may strike his honour down That violates the smallest branch herein If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do Subscribe to your deep oaths and keep it too I am resolv'd ' tis but a three years ' fast The mind shall banquet though the body pine Fat paunches have lean pates and dainty bits Make rich the ribs but bankrupt quite the wits My loving lord Dumain is mortified The grosser manner of these world 's delights He throws upon the gross world 's baser slaves To love to wealth to pomp I pine and die With all these living in philosophy I can but say their protestation over So much dear liege I have already sworn That is to live and study here three years But there are other strict observances As not to see a woman in that term Which I hope well is not enrolled there And one day in a week to touch no food And but one meal on every day beside The which I hope is not enrolled there And then to sleep but three hours in the night And not be seen to wink of all the day- When I was wo nt to think no harm all night And make a dark night too of half the day- Which I hope well is not enrolled there O these are barren tasks too hard to keep Not to see ladies study fast not sleep Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these Let me say no my liege an if you please I only swore to study with your Grace And stay here in your court for three years ' space You swore to that Berowne and to the rest By yea and nay sir then I swore in jest What is the end of study let me know Why that to know which else we should not know Things hid and barr'd you mean from common sense Ay that is study 's god like recompense Come on then I will swear to study so To know the thing I am forbid to know As thus to study where I well may dine When I to feast expressly am forbid Or study where to meet some mistress fine When mistresses from common sense are hid Or having sworn too hard a keeping oath Study to break it and not break my troth If study 's gain be thus and this be so Study knows that which yet it doth not know Swear me to this and I will ne'er say no These be the stops that hinder study quite And train our intellects to vain delight Why all delights are vain but that most vain Which with pain purchas'd doth inherit pain As painfully to pore upon a book To seek the light of truth while truth the while Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look Light seeking light doth light of light beguile So ere you find where light in darkness lies Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes Study me how to please the eye indeed By fixing it upon a fairer eye Who dazzling so that eye shall be his heed And give him light that it was blinded by Study is like the heaven 's glorious sun That will not be deep search'd with saucy looks Small have continual plodders ever won Save base authority from others ' books These earthly godfathers of heaven 's lights That give a name to every fixed star Have no more profit of their shining nights Than those that walk and wot not what they are Too much to know is to know nought but fame And every godfather can give a name How well he 's read to reason against reading Proceeded well to stop all good proceeding He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding The spring is near when green geese are a breeding How follows that Fit in his place and time In reason nothing Something then in rhyme Berowne is like an envious sneaping frost That bites the first born infants of the spring Well say I am why should proud summer boast Before the birds have any cause to sing Why should I joy in any abortive birth At Christmas I no more desire a rose Than wish a snow in May 's new fangled shows But like of each thing that in season grows So you to study now it is too late Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate Well sit out go home Berowne adieu No my good lord I have sworn to stay with you And though I have for barbarism spoke more Than for that angel knowledge you can say Yet confident I 'll keep what I have swore And bide the penance of each three years ' day Give me the paper let me read the same And to the strictest decrees I 'll write my name How well this yielding rescues thee from shame Reads ' Item That no woman shall come within a mile of my court'- Hath this been proclaimed Four days ago Let 's see the penalty Reads ' -on pain of losing her tongue ' Who devis'd this penalty Marry that did I. Sweet lord and why To fright them hence with that dread penalty A dangerous law against gentility Reads ' Item If any man be seen to talk with a woman within the term of three years he shall endure such public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise ' This article my liege yourself must break For well you know here comes in embassy The French king 's daughter with yourself to speak- A mild of grace and complete majesty- About surrender up of Aquitaine To her decrepit sick and bedrid father Therefore this article is made in vain Or vainly comes th ' admired princess hither What say you lords Why this was quite forgot So study evermore is over shot While it doth study to have what it would It doth forget to do the thing it should And when it hath the thing it hunteth most ' Tis won as towns with fire- so won so lost We must of force dispense with this decree She must lie here on mere necessity Necessity will make us all forsworn Three thousand times within this three years ' space For every man with his affects is born Not by might mast'red but by special grace If I break faith this word shall speak for me I am forsworn on mere necessity So to the laws at large I write my name Subscribes And he that breaks them in the least degree Stands in attainder of eternal shame Suggestions are to other as to me But I believe although I seem so loath I am the last that will last keep his oath But is there no quick recreation granted Ay that there is Our court you know is haunted With a refined traveller of Spain A man in all the world 's new fashion planted That hath a mint of phrases in his brain One who the music of his own vain tongue Doth ravish like enchanting harmony A man of complements whom right and wrong Have chose as umpire of their mutiny This child of fancy that Armado hight For interim to our studies shall relate In high born words the worth of many a knight From tawny Spain lost in the world 's debate How you delight my lords I know not I But I protest I love to hear him lie And I will use him for my minstrelsy Armado is a most illustrious wight A man of fire new words fashion 's own knight Costard the swain and he shall be our sport And so to study three years is but short Which is the Duke 's own person This fellow What wouldst I myself reprehend his own person for I am his Grace 's farborough but I would see his own person in flesh and blood This is he Signior Arme- Arme- commends you There 's villainy abroad this letter will tell you more Sir the contempts thereof are as touching me A letter from the magnificent Armado How low soever the matter I hope in God for high words A high hope for a low heaven God grant us patience To hear or forbear hearing To hear meekly sir and to laugh moderately or to forbear both Well sir be it as the style shall give us cause to climb in the merriness The matter is to me sir as concerning Jaquenetta The manner of it is I was taken with the manner In what manner In manner and form following sir all those three I was seen with her in the manor house sitting with her upon the form and taken following her into the park which put together is in manner and form following Now sir for the manner- it is the manner of a man to speak to a woman For the form- in some form For the following sir As it shall follow in my correction and God defend the right Will you hear this letter with attention As we would hear an oracle Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh Reads ' Great deputy the welkin 's vicegerent and sole dominator of Navarre my soul 's earth 's god and body 's fost'ring patron'- Not a word of Costard yet Reads ' So it is'- It may be so but if he say it is so he is in telling true but so Peace Be to me and every man that dares not fight No words Of other men 's

Which which I mean I upon it is ycleped thy park Then for the place Where where I mean I did encounter that obscene and most prepost'rous event that draweth from my snow white pen the ebon coloured

year 's imprisonment to be taken with a wench I was taken with none sir I was taken with a damsel Well it was proclaimed damsel This was no damsel neither sir she was a virgin It is so varied too for it was proclaimed virgin If it were I deny her virginity I was taken with a maid This ' maid ' not serve your turn sir This maid will serve my turn sir Sir I will pronounce your sentence you shall

demand to have repaid A hundred thousand crowns and not demands On payment of a hundred thousand crowns To have his title live in Aquitaine Which we much rather had depart withal And have the money by

with obedient breast What peremptory eagle sighted eye Dares look upon the heaven of her brow That is not blinded by her majesty What zeal what fury hath inspir'd thee now My love her mistress is a gracious moon She an attending star scarce seen a light My eyes are then no eyes nor I Berowne O but for my love day would turn to night Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty Do meet as at a fair in her fair cheek Where several worthies make one dignity Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues- Fie painted rhetoric O she needs it not To things of sale a seller 's praise belongs She passes praise then praise too short doth blot A wither'd hermit five score winters worn Might shake off fifty looking in her eye Beauty doth varnish age as if new born And gives the crutch the cradle 's infancy O ' tis the sun that maketh all things shine By heaven thy love is black as ebony Is ebony like her O wood divine A wife of such wood were felicity O who can give an oath Where is a book That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack If that she learn not of her eye to look No face is fair that is not full so black O paradox Black is the badge of hell The hue of dungeons and the school of night And beauty 's crest becomes the heavens well Devils soonest tempt resembling spirits of light O if in black my lady 's brows be deckt It mourns that painting and usurping hair Should ravish doters with a false aspect And therefore is she born to make black fair Her favour turns the fashion of the days For native blood is counted painting now And therefore red that would avoid dispraise Paints itself black to imitate her brow To look like her are chimney sweepers black And since her time are colliers counted bright And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack Dark needs no candles now for dark is light Your mistresses dare never come in rain For fear their colours should be wash'd away ' Twere good yours did for sir to tell you plain I 'll find a fairer face not wash'd to day I 'll prove her fair or talk till doomsday here No devil will fright thee then so much as she I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear Look here 's thy love my foot and her face see O if the streets were paved with thine eyes Her feet were much too dainty for such tread O vile Then as she goes what upward lies The street should see as she walk'd overhead But what of this Are we not all in love Nothing so sure and thereby all forsworn Then leave this chat and good Berowne now prove Our loving lawful and our faith not torn Ay marry there some flattery for this evil O some authority how to proceed Some tricks some quillets how to cheat the devil Some salve for perjury ' Tis more than need Have at you then affection 's men at arms Consider what you first did swear unto To fast to study and to see no woman- Flat treason ' gainst the kingly state of youth Say can you fast Your stomachs are too young And abstinence engenders maladies And where that you you have vow'd to study lords In that each of you have forsworn his book Can you still dream and pore and thereon look For when would you my lord or you or you Have found the ground of study 's excellence Without the beauty of a woman 's face From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive They are the ground the books the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire Why universal plodding poisons up The nimble spirits in the arteries As motion and long during action tires The sinewy vigour of the traveller Now for not looking on a woman 's face You have in that forsworn the use of eyes And study too the causer of your vow For where is author in the world Teaches such beauty as a woman 's eye Learning is but an adjunct to ourself And where we are our learning likewise is Then when ourselves we see in ladies ' eyes With ourselves Do we not likewise see our learning there O we have made a vow to study lords And in that vow we have forsworn our books For when would you my liege or you or you In leaden contemplation have found out Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes Of beauty 's tutors have enrich'd you with Other slow arts entirely keep the brain And therefore finding barren practisers Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil But love first learned in a lady 's eyes Lives not alone immured in the brain But with the motion of all elements Courses as swift as thought in every power And gives to every power a double power Above their functions and their offices It adds a precious seeing to the eye A lover 's eyes will gaze an eagle blind A lover 's ear will hear the lowest sound When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd Love 's feeling is more soft and sensible Than are the tender horns of cockled snails Love 's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste For valour is not Love a Hercules Still climbing trees in the Hesperides Subtle as Sphinx as sweet and musical As bright Apollo 's lute strung with his hair And when Love speaks the voice of all the gods Make heaven drowsy with the harmony Never durst poet touch a pen to write Until his ink were temp'red with Love 's sighs O then his lines would ravish savage ears And plant in tyrants mild humility From women 's eyes this doctrine I derive They sparkle still the right Promethean fire They are the books the arts the academes That show contain and nourish all the world Else none at all in aught proves excellent Then fools you were these women to forswear Or keeping what is sworn you will prove fools For wisdom 's sake a word that all men love Or for Love 's sake a word that loves all men Or for men 's sake the authors of these women Or women 's sake by whom we men are men- Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths It is religion to be thus forsworn For charity itself fulfils the law And who can sever love from charity Saint Cupid then and soldiers to the field Advance your standards and upon them lords Pell mell down with them be first advis'd In conflict that you get the sun of them Now to plain dealing lay these glozes by Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France And win them too therefore let us devise Some entertainment for them in their tents First from the park let us conduct them thither Then homeward every man attach the hand Of his fair mistress In the afternoon We will with some strange pastime solace them Such as the shortness of the time can shape For revels dances masks and merry hours Forerun fair Love strewing her way with flowers Away away No time shall be omitted That will betime and

neighbour thicket by And overheard what you shall overhear- That by and by disguis'd they will be here Their herald is a pretty knavish page That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage Action and accent did they teach him there ' Thus must thou speak ' and ' thus thy body bear ' And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put him out ' For ' quoth the King ' an angel shalt thou see Yet fear not thou but speak audaciously ' The boy replied ' An angel is not evil I should have fear'd her had she been a devil ' With that all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder Making the bold wag by their praises bolder One rubb'd his elbow thus and fleer'd and swore A better speech was never spoke before Another with his finger and his thumb Cried ' Via we will do't come what will come ' The third he caper'd and cried ' All goes well ' The fourth turn'd on the toe and down he fell With that they all did tumble on the ground With such a zealous laughter so profound That in this spleen ridiculous appears To check their folly passion 's solemn tears But what but what come they to visit us They do they do and are apparell'd thus Like Muscovites or Russians as I guess Their purpose is to parley court and dance And every one his love feat will advance Unto his several mistress which they 'll know By favours several which they did bestow And will they so The gallants shall be task'd For ladies we will every one be mask'd And not a man of them shall have the grace Despite of suit to see a lady 's face Hold Rosaline this favour thou shalt wear And then the King will court thee for his dear Hold take thou this my sweet and give me thine So shall Berowne take me for Rosaline And change you favours too so shall your loves Woo contrary deceiv'd by these removes Come on then wear the favours most in sight But in this changing what is your intent The effect of my intent is to cross theirs They do it but in mocking merriment And mock for mock is only my intent Their several counsels they unbosom shall To loves mistook and so be mock'd withal Upon the next occasion that we meet With visages display'd to talk and greet But shall we dance if they desire us to't No to the death we will not move a foot Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace But while ' tis spoke each turn away her face Why that contempt will kill the speaker 's heart And quite divorce his memory from his part Therefore I do it and I make no doubt The rest will ne'er come in if he be out There 's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown To make theirs ours and ours none but our own So shall we stay mocking intended game And they well mock'd depart away with shame The trumpet sounds be mask'd the maskers come All hail the richest heauties on the earth Beauties no richer than rich taffeta A holy parcel of the fairest dames Their eyes villain their eyes That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views Out- True out indeed Out of your favours heavenly spirits vouchsafe Not to behold- Once to behold rogue Once to behold with your sun beamed eyes- with your sun beamed eyes- They will not answer to that epithet You were best call it ' daughter beamed eyes ' They do not mark me and that brings me out Is this your perfectness Be gone you rogue What would these strangers Know their minds Boyet If they do speak our language ' tis our will That some plain man recount their purposes Know what they would What would you with the Princess Nothing but peace and gentle visitation What would they say they Nothing but peace and gentle visitation Why that they have and bid them so be gone She says you have it and you may be gone Say to her we have measur'd many miles To tread a measure with her on this grass They say that they have measur'd many a mile To tread a measure with you on this grass It is not so Ask them how many inches Is in one mile If they have measured many The measure then of one is eas'ly told If to come hither you have measur'd miles And many miles the Princess bids you tell How many inches doth fill up one mile Tell her we measure them by weary steps She hears herself How many weary steps Of many weary miles you have o'ergone Are numb'red in the travel of one mile We number nothing that we spend for you Our duty is so rich so infinite That we may do it still without accompt Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face That we like savages may worship it My face is but a moon and clouded too Blessed are clouds to do as such clouds do Vouchsafe bright moon and these thy stars to shine Those clouds removed upon our watery eyne O vain petitioner beg a greater matter Thou now requests but moonshine in the water Then in our measure do but vouchsafe one change Thou bid'st me beg this begging is not strange Play music then Nay you must do it soon Not yet No dance Thus change I like the moon Will you not dance How come you thus estranged You took the moon at full but now she 's changed Yet still she is the Moon and I the Man The music plays vouchsafe some motion to it Our ears vouchsafe it But your legs should do it Since you are strangers and come here by chance We 'll not be nice take hands We will not dance Why take we hands then Only to part friends Curtsy sweet hearts and so the measure ends More measure of this measure be not nice We can afford no more at such a price Price you yourselves What buys your company Your absence only That can never be Then can not we be bought and so adieu- Twice to your visor and half once to you If you deny to dance let 's hold more chat In private then I am best pleas'd with that They converse apart White handed mistress one sweet word with thee Honey and milk and sugar there is three Nay then two treys an if you grow so nice Metheglin wort and malmsey well run dice There 's half a dozen sweets Seventh sweet adieu Since you can cog I 'll play no more with you One word in secret Let it not be sweet Thou grievest my gall Gall bitter Therefore meet They converse apart Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word Name it Fair lady- Say you so Fair lord- Take that for your fair lady Please it you As much in private and I 'll bid adieu What was your vizard made without a tongue I know the reason lady why you ask O for your reason Quickly sir I long You have a double tongue within your mask And would afford my speechless vizard half ' Veal ' quoth the Dutchman Is not ' veal ' a calf A calf fair lady No a fair lord calf Let 's part the word No I 'll not be your half Take all and wean it it may prove an ox Look how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks Will you give horns chaste lady Do not so Then die a calf before your horns do grow One word in private with you ere I die Bleat softly then the butcher hears you cry The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen As is the razor 's edge invisible Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen Above the sense of sense so sensible Seemeth their conference their conceits have wings Fleeter than arrows bullets wind thought swifter things Not one word more my maids break off break off By heaven all dry beaten with pure scoff Farewell mad wenches you have simple wits Twenty adieus my frozen Muscovits Are these the breed of wits so wondered at Tapers they are with your sweet breaths puff'd out Well liking wits they have gross gross fat fat O poverty in wit kingly poor flout Will they not think you hang themselves to night Or ever but in vizards show their faces This pert Berowne was out of count'nance quite They were all in lamentable cases The King was weeping ripe for a good word Berowne did swear himself out of all suit Dumain was at my service and his sword ' No point ' quoth I my servant straight was mute Lord Longaville said I came o'er his heart And trow you what he call'd me Qualm perhaps Yes in good faith Go sickness as thou art Well better wits have worn plain statute caps But will you hear The King is my love sworn And quick Berowne hath plighted faith to me And Longaville was for my service born Dumain is mine as sure as bark on tree Madam and pretty mistresses give ear Immediately they will again be here In their own shapes for it can never be They will digest this harsh indignity Will they return They will they will God knows And leap for joy though they are lame with blows Therefore change favours and when they repair Blow like sweet roses in this summer air How blow how blow Speak to be understood Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud Dismask'd their damask sweet commixture shown Are angels vailing clouds or roses blown Avaunt perplexity What shall we do If they return in their own shapes to woo Good madam if by me you 'll be advis'd Let 's mock them still as well known as disguis'd Let us complain to them what fools were here Disguis'd like Muscovites in shapeless gear And wonder what they were and to what end Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd And their rough carriage so ridiculous Should be presented at our tent to us Ladies withdraw the gallants are at hand Whip to our tents as roes run o'er land Fair sir God save you Where 's the Princess Gone to her tent Please it your Majesty Command me any service to her thither That she vouchsafe me audience for one word I will and so will she I know my lord Exit This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease And utters it again when God doth please He is wit 's pedlar and retails his wares At wakes and wassails meetings markets fairs And we that sell by gross the Lord doth know Have not the grace to grace it with such show This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve Had he been Adam he had tempted Eve ' A can carve too and lisp why this is he That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy This is the ape of form Monsieur the Nice That when he plays at tables chides the dice In honourable terms nay he can sing A mean most meanly and in ushering Mend him who can The ladies call him sweet The stairs as he treads on them kiss his feet This is the flow'r that smiles on every one To show his teeth as white as whales bone And consciences that will not die in debt Pay him the due of ' honey tongued Boyet ' A blister on his sweet tongue with my heart That put Armado 's page out of his part See where it comes Behaviour what wert thou Till this man show'd thee And what art thou now All hail sweet madam and fair time of day ' Fair ' in ' all hail ' is foul as I conceive Construe my speeches better if you may Then wish me better I will give you leave We came to visit you and purpose now To lead you to our court vouchsafe it then This field shall hold me and so hold your vow Nor God nor I delights in perjur'd men Rebuke me not for that which you provoke The virtue of your eye must break my oath You nickname virtue vice you should have O you have liv'd in desolation here Unseen unvisited much to our shame Not so my lord it is not so I swear We have had pastimes here and pleasant game A mess of Russians left us but of late How madam Russians Ay in truth my lord Trim gallants full of courtship and of state Madam speak true It is not so my lord My lady to the manner of the days In courtesy gives undeserving praise We four indeed confronted were with four In Russian habit here they stayed an hour And talk'd apace and in that hour my lord They did not bless us with one happy word I dare not call them fools but this I think When they are thirsty fools would fain have drink This jest is dry to me Fair gentle sweet Your wit makes wise things foolish when we greet With eyes best seeing heaven 's fiery eye By light we lose light your capacity Is of that nature that to your huge store Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor This proves you wise and rich for in my eye- I am a fool and full of poverty But that you take what doth to you belong It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue O I am yours and all that I possess All the fool mine I can not give you less Which of the vizards was it that you wore Where when what vizard Why demand you this There then that vizard that superfluous case That hid the worse and show'd the better face We were descried they 'll mock us now downright Let us confess and turn it to a jest Amaz'd my lord Why looks your Highness sad Help hold his brows he 'll swoon Why look you pale Sea sick I think coming from Muscovy Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury Can any face of brass hold longer out Here stand I lady- dart thy skill at me Bruise me with scorn confound me with a flout Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit And I will wish thee never more to dance Nor never more in Russian habit wait O never will I trust to speeches penn'd Nor to the motion of a school boy 's tongue Nor never come in vizard to my friend Nor woo in rhyme like a blind harper 's song Taffeta phrases silken terms precise Three pil'd hyperboles spruce affectation Figures pedantical- these summer flies Have blown me full of maggot ostentation I do forswear them and I here protest By this white glove- how white the hand God knows!- Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd In russet yeas and honest kersey noes And to begin wench- so God help me law!- My love to thee is sound sans crack or flaw Sans ' sans ' I pray you Yet I have a trick Of the old rage bear with me I am sick I 'll leave it by degrees Soft let us see- Write ' Lord have mercy on us ' on those three They are infected in their hearts it lies They have the plague and caught it of your eyes These lords are visited you are not free For the Lord 's tokens on you do I see No they are free that gave these tokens to us Our states are forfeit seek not to undo us It is not so for how can this be true That you stand forfeit being those that sue Peace for I will not have to do with you Nor shall not if I do as I intend Speak for yourselves my wit is at an end Teach us sweet madam for our rude transgression Some fair excuse The fairest is confession Were not you here but even now disguis'd Madam I was And were you well advis'd I was fair madam When you then were here What did you whisper in your lady 's ear That more than all the world I did respect her When she shall challenge this you will reject her Upon mine honour no Peace peace forbear Your oath once broke you force not to forswear Despise me when I break this oath of mine I will and therefore keep it Rosaline What did the Russian whisper in your ear Madam he swore that he did hold me dear As precious eyesight and did value me Above this world adding thereto moreover That he would we d me or else die my lover God give thee joy of him The noble lord What mean you madam By my life my troth I never swore this lady such an oath By heaven you did and to confirm it plain You gave me this but take it sir again My faith and this the Princess I did give I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve Pardon me sir this jewel did she wear And Lord Berowne I thank him is my dear What will you have me or your

shame us let them not approach We are shame proof my lord and ' tis some policy To have one show worse than the King 's and his company I say they shall not come Nay my good lord let me o'errule you now That sport best pleases that doth least know how Where zeal strives to content and the contents Dies in the zeal of that which it presents Their form confounded makes most form in mirth When great things labouring perish in their birth A right description of our sport my lord Anointed I implore so much expense of thy royal sweet breath as will utter a brace of words Doth this man serve God Why ask you ' A speaks not like a man of God his making That is all one my fair sweet honey monarch for I protest the schoolmaster is exceeding fantastical too too vain too too vain but we will put it as they say to fortuna de la guerra I wish you the peace of mind most royal couplement Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies He presents Hector of Troy the swain Pompey the Great the parish curate Alexander Arinado 's page Hercules the pedant Judas Maccabaeus And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive These four will change habits and present the other five There is five in

Proceed good Alexander When in the world I liv'd I was the world 's commander- Most true ' tis right you were so Alisander Pompey the Great Your servant and Costard Take away the conqueror take away Alisander To Sir Nathaniel O Sir you have overthrown Alisander the conqueror You will be scrap'd out of the painted cloth for this Your lion that holds his poleaxe sitting on a close stool will be given to Ajax He will be the ninth Worthy A conqueror and afeard to speak Run away for shame Alisander Sir Nathaniel retires There an't shall please you a foolish mild man an honest man look you and soon dash'd He is a marvellous good neighbour faith and a very good bowler but for Alisander- alas you see how ' tis- a little o'erparted But there are Worthies a coming will speak their mind in some other sort Stand aside good Pompey Great Hercules is presented by this imp Whose club kill'd Cerberus that three headed canus And when be was a babe a child a shrimp Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus Quoniam he seemeth in minority Ergo I come with this apology Keep some state in thy exit and vanish MOTH retires Judas I am- A Judas Not Iscariot sir Judas I am ycliped Maccabaeus Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas A kissing traitor How art thou prov'd Judas Judas I am- The more shame for you Judas What mean you sir To make Judas hang himself Begin sir you are my elder Well followed Judas was hanged on an elder I will not be put out of countenance Because thou hast no face What is this A cittern head The head of a bodkin A death 's face in a ring The face of an old Roman coin scarce seen The pommel of Coesar 's falchion The carv'd bone face on a flask Saint George 's half cheek in a brooch Ay and in a brooch of lead Ay and worn in the cap of a tooth drawer And now forward for we have put thee in countenance You have put me out of countenance False we have given thee faces But you have outfac'd them all An thou wert a lion we would do so Therefore as he is an ass let him go And so adieu sweet Jude Nay why dost thou stay For the latter end of his name For the ass to the Jude give it him- Jud as away This is not generous not gentle not humble A light for Monsieur Judas It grows dark he may stumble Alas poor Maccabaeus how hath he been baited Hide thy head Achilles here comes Hector in arms Though my mocks come home by me I will now be merry Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this But is this Hector I think Hector was not so clean timber'd His leg is too big for Hector 's More calf certain No he is best indued in the small This can not be Hector He 's a god or a painter for he makes faces The armipotent Mars of lances the almighty Gave Hector a gift- A gilt nutmeg A lemon Stuck with cloves No cloven Peace The armipotent Mars of lances the almighty Gave Hector a gift the heir of Ilion A man so breathed that certain he would fight ye From morn till night out of his pavilion I am that flower- That mint That columbine Sweet Lord Longaville rein thy tongue I must rather give it the rein for it runs against Hector Ay and Hector 's a greyhound The sweet war man is dead and rotten sweet chucks beat not the bones of the buried when he breathed he was a man But I will forward with my device To the PRINCESS Sweet royalty bestow on me the sense of hearing Speak brave Hector we are much delighted I do adore thy sweet Grace 's slipper Aside to DUMAIN Loves her by the foot Aside to BOYET He may not by the yard This Hector far surmounted Hannibal- The party is gone fellow Hector she is gone she is two months on her way What meanest thou Faith unless you play the honest Troyan the poor wench is cast away She 's quick the child brags in her belly already ' tis yours Dost thou infamonize me among potentates Thou shalt die Then shall Hector be whipt for Jaquenetta that is quick by him and hang'd for Pompey that is dead by him Most rare Pompey Renowned Pompey Greater than Great Great great great Pompey Pompey the Huge Hector trembles Pompey is moved More Ates more Ates Stir them on stir them on Hector will challenge him Ay if ' a have no more man 's blood in his belly than will sup a flea By the North Pole I do challenge thee I will not fight with a pole like a Northern man I 'll slash I 'll do it by the sword I bepray you let me borrow my arms again Room for the incensed Worthies I 'll do it in my shirt Most resolute Pompey Master let me take you a buttonhole lower Do you not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat What mean you You will lose your reputation Gentlemen and soldiers pardon me I will not combat in my shirt You may not deny it Pompey hath made the challenge Sweet bloods I both may and will What reason have you for ' t The naked truth of it is I have no shirt I go woolward for penance True and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of linen since when I 'll be sworn he wore none but a dishclout of Jaquenetta 's and that ' a wears next his heart for a favour God save you madam Welcome Marcade But that thou interruptest our merriment I am sorry madam for the news I bring Is heavy in my tongue The King your father- Dead for my life Even so my tale is told WOrthies away the scene begins to cloud For mine own part I breathe free breath I have seen the day of wrong through the little hole of discretion and I will right myself like a soldier Exeunt WORTHIES How fares your Majesty Boyet prepare I will away to night Madam not so I do beseech you stay Prepare I say I thank you gracious lords For all your fair endeavours and entreat Out of a new sad soul that you vouchsafe In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide The liberal opposition of our spirits If over boldly we have borne ourselves In the converse of breath- your gentleness Was guilty of it Farewell worthy lord A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue Excuse me so coming too short of thanks For my great suit so easily obtain'd The extreme parts of time extremely forms All causes to the purpose of his speed And often at his very loose decides That which long process could not arbitrate And though the mourning brow of progeny Forbid the smiling courtesy of love The holy suit which fain it would convince Yet since love 's argument was first on foot Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it From what it purpos'd since to wail friends lost Is not by much so wholesome profitable As to rejoice at friends but newly found I understand you not my griefs are double Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief And by these badges understand the King For your fair sakes have we neglected time Play'd foul play with our oaths your beauty ladies Hath much deformed us fashioning our humours Even to the opposed end of our intents And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous As love is full of unbefitting strains All wanton as a child skipping and vain Form'd by the eye and therefore like the eye Full of strange shapes of habits and of forms Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll To every varied object in his glance Which parti coated presence of loose love Put on by us if in your heavenly eyes Have misbecom'd our oaths and gravities Those heavenly eyes that look into these faults Suggested us to make Therefore ladies Our love being yours the error that love makes Is likewise yours We to ourselves prove false By being once false for ever to be true To those that make us both- fair ladies you And even that falsehood in itself a sin Thus purifies itself and turns to grace We have receiv'd your letters full of love Your favours the ambassadors of love And in our maiden council rated them At courtship pleasant jest and courtesy As bombast and as lining to the time But more devout than this in our respects Have we not been and therefore met your loves In their own fashion like a merriment Our letters madam show'd much more than jest So did our looks We did not quote them so Now at the latest minute of the hour Grant us your loves A time methinks too short To make a world without end bargain in No no my lord your Grace is perjur'd much Full of dear guiltiness and therefore this If for my love as there is no such cause You will do aught- this shall you do for me Your oath I will not trust but go with speed To some forlorn and naked hermitage Remote from all the pleasures of the world There stay until the twelve celestial signs Have brought about the annual reckoning If this austere insociable life Change not your offer made in heat of blood If frosts and fasts hard lodging and thin weeds Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love But that it bear this trial and last love Then at the expiration of the year Come challenge me challenge me by these deserts And by this virgin palm now kissing thine I will be thine and till that instant shut My woeful self up in a mournful house Raining the tears of lamentation For the remembrance of my father 's death If this thou do deny let our hands part Neither intitled in the other 's heart If this or more than this I would deny To flatter up these powers of mine with rest The sudden hand of death close up mine eye Hence hermit then my heart is in thy breast And what to me my love and what to me You must he purged too your sins are rack'd You are attaint with faults and perjury Therefore if you my favour mean to get A twelvemonth shall you spend and never rest But seek the weary beds of people sick But what to me my love but what to me A wife A beard fair health and honesty With threefold love I wish you all these three O shall I say I thank you gentle wife No so my lord a twelvemonth and a day I 'll mark no words that smooth fac'd wooers say Come when the King doth to my lady come Then if I have much love I 'll give you some I 'll serve thee true and faithfully till then Yet swear not lest ye be forsworn again What says Maria At the twelvemonth 's end I 'll change my black gown for a faithful friend I 'll stay with patience but the time is long The liker you few taller are so young Studies my lady Mistress look on me Behold the window of my heart mine eye What humble suit attends thy answer there Impose some service on me for thy love Oft have I heard of you my Lord Berowne Before I saw you and the world 's large tongue Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks Full of comparisons and wounding flouts Which you on all estates will execute That lie within the mercy of your wit To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain And therewithal to win me if you please Without the which I am not to be won You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day Visit the speechless sick and still converse With groaning wretches and your task shall be With all the fierce endeavour of your wit To enforce the pained impotent to smile To move wild laughter in the throat of death It can not be it is impossible Mirth can not move a soul in agony Why that 's the way to choke a gibing spirit Whose influence is begot of that loose grace Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools A jest 's prosperity lies in the ear Of him that hears it never in the tongue Of him that makes it then if sickly ears Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans Will hear your idle scorns continue then And I will have you and that fault withal But if they will not throw away that spirit And I shall find you empty of that fault Right joyful of your reformation A twelvemonth Well befall what will befall I 'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital To the King Ay sweet my lord and so I take my leave No madam we will bring you on your way Our wooing doth not end like an old play Jack hath not Jill These ladies ' courtesy Might well have made our sport a comedy Come sir it wants a twelvemonth an ' a day And then ' twill end That 's too long for a play Sweet Majesty vouchsafe me- Was not that not Hector The worthy knight of Troy I will kiss thy royal finger and take leave I am a votary I have vow'd to Jaquenetta to hold the plough for her sweet love three year But most esteemed greatness will you hear the dialogue that the two learned men have compiled in praise of the Owl and the Cuckoo It should have followed in the end of our show Call them forth quickly we will do so Holla approach The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo You that way we this way Exeunt When shall we three meet again In thunder lightning or in rain When the hurlyburly 's done When the battle 's lost and won That will be ere the set of sun Where the place Upon the heath There to meet with Macbeth I come Graymalkin Paddock calls Anon Fair is foul and foul is fair Hover through the fog and filthy air Exeunt What bloody man is that He can report As seemeth by his plight of the revolt The newest state This is the sergeant Who like a good and hardy soldier fought ' Gainst my captivity Hail brave friend Say to the King the knowledge of the broil As thou didst leave it Doubtful it stood As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art The merciless Macdonwald- Worthy to be a rebel for to that The multiplying villainies of nature Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied And Fortune on his damned quarrel smiling Show'd like a rebel 's whore But all 's too weak For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name- Disdaining Fortune with his brandish'd steel Which smoked with bloody execution Like Valor 's minion carved out his passage Till he faced the slave Which ne'er shook hands nor bade farewell to him Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps And fix'd his head upon our battlements O valiant cousin Worthy gentleman As whence the sun ' gins his reflection Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come Discomfort swells Mark King of Scotland mark No sooner justice had with valor arm'd Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men Began a fresh assault Dismay'd not this Our captains Macbeth and Banquo Yes As sparrows eagles or the hare the lion If I say sooth I must report they were As cannons overcharged with double cracks So they Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds Or memorize another Golgotha I can not tell- But I am faint my gashes cry for help So well thy words become thee as thy wounds They smack of honor both Go get him surgeons What a haste looks through his eyes So should he look That seems to speak things strange God save the King Whence camest thou worthy Thane From Fife great King Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold Norway himself with terrible numbers Assisted by that most disloyal traitor The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict Till that Bellona 's bridegroom lapp'd in proof Confronted him with self comparisons Point against point rebellious arm ' gainst arm Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude The victory fell on us Great happiness That now Sweno the Norways ' king craves composition Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme 's Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest Go pronounce his present death And with his former title greet Macbeth I 'll see it done What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won Where hast thou been sister Killing swine Sister where thou A sailor 's wife had chestnuts in her lap And mounch'd and mounch'd and mounch'd Give me quoth I. Aroint thee witch the rump fed ronyon cries Her husband 's to Aleppo gone master the Tiger But in a sieve I 'll thither sail And like a rat without a tail I 'll do I 'll do and I 'll do I 'll give thee a wind Thou'rt kind And I another I myself have all the other And the very ports they blow All the quarters that they know I ' the shipman 's card I will drain him dry as hay Sleep shall neither night nor day Hang upon his penthouse lid He shall live a man forbid Weary se'nnights nine times nine Shall he dwindle peak and pine Though his bark can not be lost Yet it shall be tempest toss'd Look what I have Show me show me Here I have a pilot 's thumb Wreck'd as homeward he did come Drum within A drum a drum Macbeth doth come The weird sisters hand in hand Posters of the sea and land Thus do go about about Thrice to thine and thrice to mine And thrice again to make up nine Peace The charm 's wound up So foul and fair a day I have not seen How far is't call'd to Forres What are these So wither'd and so wild in their attire That look not like the inhabitants o ' the earth And yet are on't Live you or are you aught That man may question You seem to understand me By each at once her choppy finger laying Upon her skinny lips You should be women And yet your beards forbid me to interpret That you are so Speak if you can What are you All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Glamis All hail Macbeth hail to thee Thane of Cawdor All hail Macbeth that shalt be King hereafter Good sir why do you start and seem to fear Things that do sound so fair I ' the name of truth Are ye fantastical or that indeed Which outwardly ye show My noble partner You greet with present grace and great prediction Of noble having and of royal hope That he seems rapt withal To me you speak not If you can look into the seeds of time And say which grain will grow and which will not Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear Your favors nor your hate Hail Hail Hail Lesser than Macbeth and greater Not so happy yet much happier Thou shalt get kings though thou be none So all hail Macbeth and Banquo Banquo and Macbeth all hail Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more By Sinel 's death I know I am Thane of Glamis But how of Cawdor The Thane of Cawdor lives A prosperous gentleman and to be King Stands not within the prospect of belief No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence You owe this strange intelligence or why Upon this blasted heath you stop our way With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you The earth hath bubbles as the water has And these are of them Whither are they vanish'd Into the air and what seem'd corporal melted As breath into the wind Would they had stay'd Were such things here as we do speak about Or have we eaten on the insane root That takes the reason prisoner Your children shall be kings You shall be King And Thane of Cawdor too Went it not so To the selfsame tune and words Who 's here The King hath happily received Macbeth The news of thy success and when he reads Thy personal venture in the rebels ' fight His wonders and his praises do contend Which should be thine or his Silenced with that In viewing o'er the rest o ' the selfsame day He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make Strange images of death As thick as hail Came post with post and every one did bear Thy praises in his kingdom 's great defense And pour'd them down before him We are sent To give thee from our royal master thanks Only to herald thee into his sight Not pay thee And for an earnest of a greater honor He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor In which addition hail most worthy Thane For it is thine What can the devil speak true The Thane of Cawdor lives Why do you dress me In borrow'd robes Who was the Thane lives yet But under heavy judgement bears that life Which he deserves to lose Whether he was combined With those of Norway or did line the rebel With hidden help and vantage or that with both He labor'd in his country 's wreck I know not But treasons capital confess'd and proved Have overthrown him Aside Glamis and Thane of Cawdor The greatest is behind To Ross and Angus Thanks for your Aside to Macbeth That trusted home Might yet enkindle you unto the crown Besides the Thane of Cawdor But ' tis strange And oftentimes to win us to our harm The instruments of darkness tell us truths Win us with honest trifles to betray 's In deepest consequence- Cousins a word I pray you Aside Two truths are told As happy prologues to the swelling act Of the imperial theme I thank you gentlemen Aside This supernatural soliciting Can not be ill can not be good If ill Why hath it given me earnest of success Commencing in a truth I am Thane of Cawdor If good why do I yield to that suggestion Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair And make my seated heart knock at my ribs Against the use of nature Present fears Are less than horrible imaginings My thought whose murther yet is but fantastical Shakes so my single state of man that function Is smother'd in surmise and nothing is But what is not Look how our partner 's rapt Aside If chance will have me King why chance may New honors come upon him Like our strange garments cleave not to their mould But with the aid of use Aside Come what come may Time and the hour runs through the roughest day Worthy Macbeth we stay upon your leisure Give me your favor my dull brain was wrought With things forgotten Kind gentlemen your pains Are register'd where every day I turn The leaf to read them Let us toward the King Think upon what hath chanced and at more time The interim having weigh'd it let us speak Our free hearts each to other Very gladly Till then enough Come friends Exeunt Is execution done on Cawdor Are not Those in commission yet return'd My liege They are not yet come back But I have spoke With one that saw him die who did report That very frankly he confess'd his treasons Implored your Highness ' pardon and set forth A deep repentance Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it he died As one that had been studied in his death To throw away the dearest thing he owed As ' twere a careless trifle There 's no art To find the mind 's construction in the face He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust The service and the loyalty lowe In doing it pays itself Your Highness ' part Is to receive our duties and our duties Are to your throne and state children and servants Which do but what they should by doing everything Safe toward your love and honor Welcome hither I have begun to plant thee and will labor To make thee full of growing Noble Banquo That hast no less deserved nor must be known No less to have done so let me infold thee And hold thee to my heart There if I grow The harvest is your own My plenteous joys Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves In drops of sorrow Sons kinsmen thanes And you whose places are the nearest know We will establish our estate upon Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter The Prince of Cumberland which honor must Not unaccompanied invest him only But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine On all deservers From hence to Inverness And bind us further to you The rest is labor which is not used for you I 'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful The hearing of my wife with your approach So humbly take my leave My worthy Cawdor Aside The Prince of Cumberland That is a step On which I must fall down or else o'erleap For in my way it lies Stars hide your fires Let not light see my black and deep desires The eye wink at the hand yet let that be Which the eye fears when it is done to see Exit True worthy Banquo He is full so valiant And in his commendations I am fed It is a banquet to me Let 's after him Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome It is a peerless kinsman Flourish Exeunt They met me in the day of success and I have learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than mortal knowledge When I burned in desire to question them further they made themselves air into which they vanished Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the King who all hailed me ' Thane of Cawdor ' by which title before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the coming on of time with ' Hail King that shalt be ' This have I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of greatness that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee Lay it to thy heart and farewell The King comes here tonight Thou'rt mad to say it Is not thy master with him who were't so Would have inform'd for preparation So please you it is true our Thane is coming One of my fellows had the speed of him Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more Than would make up his message Give him tending He brings great news Exit Messenger The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements Come you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here And fill me from the crown to the toe top full Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood Stop up the access and passage to remorse That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between The effect and it Come to my woman 's breasts And take my milk for gall your murthering ministers Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature 's mischief Come thick night And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell That my keen knife see not the wound it makes Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry Hold hold My dearest love Duncan comes here tonight And when goes hence Tomorrow as he purposes O never Shall sun that morrow see Your face my Thane is as a book where men May read strange matters To beguile the time Look like the time bear welcome in your eye Your hand your tongue look like the innocent flower But be the serpent under it He that 's coming Must be provided for and you shall put This night 's great business into my dispatch Which shall to all our nights and days to come Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom We will speak further Only look up clear To alter favor ever is to fear Leave all the rest to me Exeunt This castle hath a pleasant seat the air Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself Unto our gentle senses This guest of summer The temple haunting martlet does approve By his loved mansionry that the heaven 's breath Smells wooingly here No jutty frieze Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle Where they most breed and haunt I have observed The air is delicate See see our honor'd hostess The love that follows us sometime is our trouble Which still we thank as love Herein I teach you How you shall bid God ' ield us for your pains And thank us for your trouble All our service In every point twice done and then done double Were poor and single business to contend Against those honors deep and broad wherewith Your Majesty loads our house For those of old And the late dignities heap'd up to them We rest your hermits Where 's the Thane of Cawdor We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose To be his purveyor but he rides well And his great love sharp as his spur hath holp him To his home before us Fair and noble hostess We are your guest tonight Your servants ever Have theirs themselves and what is theirs in compt To make their audit at your Highness ' pleasure Still to return your own Give me your hand Conduct me to mine host We love him highly And shall continue our graces towards him By your leave hostess Exeunt If it were done when ' tis done then ' twere well It were done quickly If the assassination Could trammel up the consequence and catch With his surcease success that but this blow Might be the be all and the end all -here But here upon this bank and shoal of time We'ld jump the life to come But in these cases We still have judgement here that we but teach Bloody instructions which being taught return To plague the inventor This even handed justice Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice To our own lips He 's here in double trust First as I am his kinsman and his subject Strong both against the deed then as his host Who should against his murtherer shut the door Not bear the knife myself Besides this Duncan Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been So clear in his great office that his virtues Will plead like angels trumpet tongued against The deep damnation of his taking off And pity like a naked new born babe Striding the blast or heaven 's cherubin horsed Upon the sightless couriers of the air Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye That tears shall drown the wind I have no spur To prick the sides of my intent but only Vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself And falls on the other He has almost supp'd Why have you left the chamber Hath he ask'd for me Know you not he has We will proceed no further in this business He hath honor'd me of late and I have bought Golden opinions from all sorts of people Which would be worn now in their newest gloss Not cast aside so soon Was the hope drunk Wherein you dress'd yourself Hath it slept since And wakes it now to look so green and pale At what it did so freely From this time Such I account thy love Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valor As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life And live a coward in thine own esteem Letting I dare not wait upon I would Like the poor cat i ' the adage Prithee peace I dare do all that may become a man Who dares do more is none What beast wast then That made you break this enterprise to me When you durst do it then you were a man And to be more than what you were you would Be so much more the man Nor time nor place Did then adhere and yet you would make both They have made themselves and that their fitness now Does unmake you I have given suck and know How tender ' tis to love the babe that milks me- I would while it was smiling in my face Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums And dash'd the brains out had I so sworn as you Have done to this If we should fail We fail But screw your courage to the sticking place And we 'll not fail When Duncan is asleep- Whereto the rather shall his day 's hard journey Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains Will I with wine and wassail so convince That memory the warder of the brain Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason A limbeck only When in swinish sleep Their drenched natures lie as in a death What can not you and I perform upon The unguarded Duncan What not put upon His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt Of our great quell Bring forth men children only For thy undaunted mettle should compose Nothing but males Will it not be received When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two Of his own chamber and used their very daggers That they have done't Who dares receive it other As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar Upon his death I am settled and bend up Each corporal agent to this terrible feat Away and mock the time with fairest show False face must hide what the false heart doth know How goes the night boy The moon is down I have not heard the clock And she goes down at twelve I take't ' tis later sir Hold take my sword There 's husbandry in heaven Their candles are all out Take thee that too A heavy summons lies like lead upon me And yet I would not sleep Merciful powers Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature Gives way to in repose A friend What sir not yet at rest The King 's abed He hath been in unusual pleasure and Sent forth great largess to your offices This diamond he greets your wife withal By the name of most kind hostess and shut up In measureless content Being unprepared Our will became the servant to defect Which else should free have wrought All 's well I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters To you they have show'd some truth I think not of them Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve We would spend it in some words upon that business If you would grant the time At your kind'st leisure If you shall cleave to my consent when ' tis It shall make honor for you So I lose none In seeking to augment it but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear I shall be counsel'd Good repose the while Thanks sir the like to you Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed Exit Servant Is this a dagger which I see before me The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee I have thee not and yet I see thee still Art thou not fatal vision sensible To feeling as to sight Or art thou but A dagger of the mind a false creation Proceeding from the heat oppressed brain I see thee yet in form as palpable As this which now I draw Thou marshal'st me the way that I was going And such an instrument I was to use Mine eyes are made the fools o ' the other senses Or else worth all the rest I see thee still And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood Which was not so before There 's no such thing It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes Now o'er the one half world Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse The curtain'd sleep witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate 's offerings and wither'd Murther Alarum'd by his sentinel the wolf Whose howl 's his watch thus with his stealthy pace With Tarquin 's ravishing strides towards his design Moves like a ghost Thou sure and firm set earth Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout And take the present horror from the time Which now suits with it Whiles I threat he lives Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold What hath quench'd them hath given me fire Hark Peace It was the owl that shriek'd the fatal bellman Which gives the stern'st good night He is about it The doors are open and the surfeited grooms Do mock their charge with snores I have drugg'd their possets That death and nature do contend about them Whether they live or die Within Who 's there ' what ho Alack I am afraid they have awaked And ' tis not done The attempt and not the deed Confounds us Hark I laid their daggers ready He could not miss 'em Had he not resembled My father as he slept I had done't I have done the deed Didst thou not hear a noise I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry Did not you speak When Now As I descended Ay Hark Who lies i ' the second chamber Donalbain This is a sorry sight Looks on his hands A foolish thought to say a sorry sight There 's one did laugh in 's sleep and one cried There are two lodged together One cried God bless us and Amen the other As they had seen me with these hangman 's hands Listening their fear I could not say Amen When they did say God bless us Consider it not so deeply But wherefore could not I pronounce Amen I had most need of blessing and Amen Stuck in my throat These deeds must not be thought After these ways so it will make us mad I heard a voice cry Sleep no more Macbeth does murther sleep -the innocent sleep Sleep that knits up the ravel'd sleave of care The death of each day 's life sore labor 's bath Balm of hurt minds great nature 's second course Chief nourisher in life 's feast- What do you mean Still it cried Sleep no more to all the house Glamis hath murther'd sleep and therefore Cawdor Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more Who was it that thus cried Why worthy Thane You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things Go get some water And wash this filthy witness from your hand Why did you bring these daggers from the place They must lie there Go carry them and smear The sleepy grooms with blood I 'll go no more I am afraid to think what I have done Look on't again I dare not Infirm of purpose Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures ' tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil If he do bleed I 'll gild the faces of the grooms withal For it must seem their guilt Exit Knocking within Whence is that knocking How is't with me when every noise appals me What hands are here Ha they pluck out mine eyes Will all great Neptune 's ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine Making the green one red My hands are of your color but I shame To wear a heart so white Knocking within I hear knocking At the south entry Retire we to our chamber A little water clears us of this deed How easy is it then Your constancy Hath left you unattended Knocking within Hark more knocking Get on your nightgown lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts To know my deed ' twere best not know myself Here 's a knocking indeed If a man were porter of Hell Gate he should have old turning the key Knocking within Knock knock knock Who 's there i ' the name of Belzebub Here 's a farmer that hanged himself on th ' expectation of plenty Come in time Have napkins enow about you here you 'll sweat fort Knocking within Knock knock Who 's there in th ' other devil 's name Faith here 's an equivocator that could swear in both the scales against either scale who committed treason enough for God 's sake yet could not equivocate to heaven O come in equivocator Knocking within Knock knock knock Who 's there Faith here 's an English tailor come hither for stealing out of a French hose Come in tailor here you may roast your goose Knocking within Knock knock Never at quiet What are you But this place is too cold for hell I 'll devil porter it no further I had thought to have let in some of all professions that go the primrose way to the everlasting bonfire Knocking within Anon anon I pray you remember the porter Was it so late friend ere you went to bed That you do lie so late Faith sir we were carousing till the second cock and drink sir is a great provoker of three things What three things does drink especially provoke Marry sir nose painting sleep and urine Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the desire but it takes away the performance Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him stand to and not stand to in conclusion equivocates him in a sleep and giving him the lie leaves him I believe drink gave thee the lie last night That it did sir i ' the very throat on me but requited him for his lie and I think being too strong for him though he took up my legs sometime yet I made shift to cast him Is thy master stirring Good morrow noble sir morrow both Is the King stirring worthy Thane Not yet He did command me to call timely on him I have almost slipp'd the hour I 'll bring you to him I know this is a joyful trouble to you But yet ' tis one The labor we delight in physics pain This is the door Goes the King hence today He does he did appoint so The night has been unruly Where we lay Our chimneys were blown down and as they say Lamentings heard i ' the air strange screams of death And prophesying with accents terrible Of dire combustion and confused events New hatch'd to the woeful time The obscure bird Clamor'd the livelong night Some say the earth Was feverous and did shake ' Twas a rough fight My young remembrance can not parallel A fellow to it O horror horror horror Tongue nor heart Can not conceive nor name thee LENNOX What 's the matter Confusion now hath made his masterpiece Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope The Lord 's anointed temple and stole thence The life o ' the building What is't you say the life Mean you his Majesty Approach the chamber and destroy your sight With a new Gorgon Do not bid me speak See and then speak yourselves What 's the business That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley The sleepers of the house Speak speak O gentle lady ' Tis not for you to hear what I can speak The repetition in a woman 's ear Would murther as it fell Woe alas What in our house Too cruel anywhere Dear Duff I prithee contradict thyself And say it is not so Had I but died an hour before this chance I had lived a blessed time for from this instant There 's nothing serious in mortality All is but toys renown and grace is dead The wine of life is drawn and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of What is amiss You are and do not know't The spring the head the fountain of your blood Is stopped the very source of it is stopp'd Your royal father 's murther'd Those of his chamber as it seem'd had done't Their hands and faces were all badged with blood So were their daggers which unwiped we found Upon their pillows They stared and were distracted no man 's life Was to be trusted with them O yet I do repent me of my fury That I did kill them Wherefore did you so Who can be wise amazed temperate and furious Loyal and neutral in a moment No man The expedition of my violent love Outrun the pauser reason Here lay Duncan His silver skin laced with his golden blood And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature For ruin 's wasteful entrance there the murtherers Steep'd in the colors of their trade their daggers Unmannerly breech'd with gore Who could refrain That had a heart to love and in that heart Courage to make 's love known Help me hence ho Look to the lady Aside to Donalbain Why do we hold our tongues That most may claim this argument for ours Aside to Malcolm What should be spoken here where Aside to Donalbain Nor our strong sorrow Upon the foot of motion Look to the lady And so do I. So all Let 's briefly put on manly readiness And meet i ' the hall together Well contented What will you do Let 's not consort with them To show an unfelt sorrow is an office Which the false man does easy I 'll to England To Ireland I our separated fortune Shall keep us both the safer Where we are There 's daggers in men 's smiles the near in blood The nearer bloody This murtherous shaft that 's shot Hath not yet lighted and our safest way Is to avoid the aim Therefore to horse And let us not be dainty of leave taking But shift away There 's warrant in that theft Which steals itself when there 's no mercy left Threescore and ten I can remember well Within the volume of which time I have seen Hours dreadful and things strange but this sore night Hath trifled former knowings Ah good father Thou seest the heavens as troubled with man 's act Threaten his bloody stage By the clock ' tis day And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp Is't night 's predominance or the day 's shame That darkness does the face of earth entomb When living light should kiss it ' Tis unnatural Even like the deed that 's done On Tuesday last A falcon towering in her pride of place Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd And Duncan 's horses a thing most strange and certain- Beauteous and swift the minions of their race Turn'd wild in nature broke their stalls flung out Contending ' gainst obedience as they would make War with mankind ' Tis said they eat each other They did so to the amazement of mine eyes That look'd upon't Why see you not Is't known who did this more than bloody deed Those that Macbeth hath slain Alas the day What good could they pretend They were suborn'd Malcolm and Donalbain the King 's two sons Are stol'n away and fled which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed ' Gainst nature still Thriftless ambition that wilt ravin up Thine own life 's means Then ' tis most like The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth He is already named and gone to Scone To be invested Where is Duncan 's body Carried to Colmekill The sacred storehouse of his predecessors And guardian of their bones Will you to Scone No cousin I 'll to Fife Well I will thither Well may you see things well done there Adieu Lest our old robes sit easier than our new Farewell father God 's benison go with you and with those That would make good of bad and friends of foes Thou hast it now King Cawdor Glamis all As the weird women promised and I fear Thou play'dst most foully for't yet it was said It should not stand in thy posterity But that myself should be the root and father Of many kings If there come truth from them As upon thee Macbeth their speeches shine Why by the verities on thee made good May they not be my oracles as well And set me up in hope But hush no more Here 's our chief guest If he had been forgotten It had been as a gap in our great feast And all thing unbecoming Tonight we hold a solemn supper sir And I 'll request your presence Let your Highness Command upon me to the which my duties Are with a most indissoluble tie Forever knit Ride you this afternoon Ay my good lord We should have else desired your good advice Which still hath been both grave and prosperous In this day 's council but we 'll take tomorrow Is't far you ride ' As far my lord as will fill up the time ' Twixt this and supper Go not my horse the better I must become a borrower of the night For a dark hour or twain Fail not our feast My lord I will not We hear our bloody cousins are bestow'd In England and in Ireland not confessing Their cruel parricide filling their hearers With strange invention But of that tomorrow When therewithal we shall have cause of state Craving us jointly Hie you to horse adieu Till you return at night Goes Fleance with you Ay my good lord Our time does call upon ' s. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot And so I do commend you to their backs Farewell Exit Banquo Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night to make society The sweeter welcome we will keep ourself Till supper time alone While then God be with you They are my lord without the palace gate Bring them before us Exit Attendant To be thus is nothing But to be safely thus Our fears in Banquo Stick deep and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear'd ' Tis much he dares And to that dauntless temper of his mind He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor To act in safety There is none but he Whose being I do fear and under him My genius is rebuked as it is said Mark Antony 's was by Caesar He chid the sisters When first they put the name of King upon me And bade them speak to him then prophet like They hail'd him father to a line of kings Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown And put a barren sceptre in my gripe Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand No son of mine succeeding If't be so For Banquo 's issue have I filed my mind For them the gracious Duncan have I murther'd Put rancors in the vessel of my peace Only for them and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings Rather than so come Fate into the list And champion me to the utterance Who 's there It was so please your Highness Well then now Have you consider'd of my speeches Know That it was he in the times past which held you So under fortune which you thought had been Our innocent self This I made good to you In our last conference pass'd in probation with you How you were borne in hand how cross'd the instruments Who wrought with them and all things else that might To half a soul and to a notion crazed Say Thus did Banquo You made it known to us I did so and went further which is now Our point of second meeting Do you find Your patience so predominant in your nature That you can let this go Are you so gospel'd To pray for this good man and for his issue Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave And beggar'd yours forever We are men my liege Ay in the catalogue ye go for men As hounds and greyhounds mongrels spaniels curs Shoughs waterrugs and demi wolves are clept All by the name of dogs The valued file Distinguishes the swift the slow the subtle The housekeeper the hunter every one According to the gift which bounteous nature Hath in him closed whereby he does receive Particular addition from the bill That writes them all alike and so of men Now if you have a station in the file Not i ' the worst rank of manhood say it And I will put that business in your bosoms Whose execution takes your enemy off Grapples you to the heart and love of us Who wear our health but sickly in his life Which in his death were perfect I am one my liege Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world Have so incensed that I am reckless what I do to spite the world And I another So weary with disasters tugg'd with fortune That I would set my life on any chance To mend it or be rid on't Both of you Know Banquo was your enemy True my lord So is he mine and in such bloody distance That every minute of his being thrusts Against my near'st of life and though I could With barefaced power sweep him from my sight And bid my will avouch it yet I must not For certain friends that are both his and mine Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall Who I myself struck down And thence it is That I to your assistance do make love Masking the business from the common eye For sundry weighty reasons We shall my lord Perform what you command us Though our lives- Your spirits shine through you Within this hour at most I will advise you where to plant yourselves Acquaint you with the perfect spy o ' the time The moment on't fort must be done tonight And something from the palace always thought That I require a clearness and with him- To leave no rubs nor botches in the work- Fleance his son that keeps him company Whose absence is no less material to me Than is his father 's must embrace the fate Of that dark hour Resolve yourselves apart I 'll come to you anon We are resolved my lord I 'll call upon you straight Abide within Is Banquo gone from court Ay madam but returns again tonight Say to the King I would attend his leisure For a few words Madam I will Exit Nought 's had all 's spent Where our desire is got without content ' Tis safer to be that which we destroy Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy We have scotch'd the snake not kill'd it She 'll close and be herself whilst our poor malice Remains in danger of her former tooth But let the frame of things disjoint both the worlds suffer Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep In the affliction of these terrible dreams That shake us nightly Better be with the dead Whom we to gain our peace have sent to peace Than on the torture of the mind to lie In restless ecstasy Duncan is in his grave After life 's fitful fever he sleeps well Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison Malice domestic foreign levy nothing Can touch him further Come on Gentle my lord sleek o'er your rugged looks Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight So shall I love and so I pray be you Let your remembrance apply to Banquo Present him eminence both with eye and tongue Unsafe the while that we Must lave our honors in these flattering streams And make our faces vizards to our hearts Disguising what they are You must leave this O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife Thou know'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives But in them nature 's copy 's not eterne There 's comfort yet they are assailable Then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown His cloister'd flight ere to black Hecate 's summons The shard borne beetle with his drowsy hums Hath rung night 's yawning peal there shall be done A deed of dreadful note What 's to be done Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck Till thou applaud the deed Come seeling night Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale Light thickens and the crow Makes wing to the rooky wood Good things of day begin to droop and drowse Whiles night 's black agents to their preys do rouse Thou marvel'st at my words but hold thee still Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill So prithee go with me Exeunt But who did bid thee join with us Macbeth He needs not our mistrust since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just Then stand with us The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day Now spurs the lated traveler apace To gain the timely inn and near approaches The subject of our watch Hark I hear horses Within Give us a light there ho Then ' tis he the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i ' the court His horses go about Almost a mile but he does usually- So all men do -from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk A light a light ' Tis he Stand to't It will be rain tonight Let it come down O treachery Fly good Fleance fly fly fly Thou mayst revenge O slave Dies Fleance escapes Who did strike out the light Wast not the way There 's but one down the son is fled We have lost Best half of our affair Well let 's away and say how much is done You know your own degrees sit down At first And last the hearty welcome Thanks to your Majesty Ourself will mingle with society And play the humble host Our hostess keeps her state but in best time We will require her welcome Pronounce it for me sir to all our friends For my heart speaks they are welcome See they encounter thee with their hearts ' thanks Both sides are even here I 'll sit i ' the midst Be large in mirth anon we 'll drink a measure The table round Approaches the door There 's blood upon thy ' Tis Banquo 's then ' Tis better thee without than he within Is he dispatch'd My lord his throat is cut that I did for him Thou art the best o ' the cut throats Yet he 's good That did the like for Fleance If thou didst it Thou art the nonpareil Most royal sir Fleance is ' scaped Aside Then comes my fit again I had else been perfect Whole as the marble founded as the rock As broad and general as the casing air But now I am cabin'd cribb'd confin'd bound in To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo 's safe Ay my good lord Safe in a ditch he bides With twenty trenched gashes on his head The least a death to nature Thanks for that There the grown serpent lies the worm that 's fled Hath nature that in time will venom breed No teeth for the present Get thee gone Tomorrow We 'll hear ourselves again My royal lord You do not give the cheer The feast is sold That is not often vouch'd while ' tis amaking ' Tis given with welcome To feed were best at home From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony Meeting were bare without it Sweet remembrancer Now good digestion wait on appetite And health on both May't please your Highness sit Here had we now our country 's honor roof'd Were the graced person of our Banquo present Who may I rather challenge for unkindness Than pity for mischance His absence sir Lays blame upon his promise Please't your Highness To grace us with your royal company The table 's full Here is a place reserved sir Where Here my good lord What is't that moves your Highness Which of you have done this What my good lord Thou canst not say I did it never shake Thy gory locks at me Gentlemen rise his Highness is well Sit worthy friends my lord is often thus And hath been from his youth Pray you keep seat The fit is momentary upon a thought He will again be well If much you note him You shall offend him and extend his passion Feed and regard him not Are you a man Ay and a bold one that dare look on that Which might appal the devil O proper stuff This is the very painting of your fear This is the air drawn dagger which you said Led you to Duncan O these flaws and starts Impostors to true fear would well become A woman 's story at a winter 's fire Authorized by her grandam Shame itself Why do you make such faces When all 's done You look but on a stool Prithee see there Behold Look Lo How say you Why what care I If thou canst nod speak too If charnel houses and our graves must send Those that we bury back our monuments Shall be the maws of kites Exit Ghost What quite unmann'd in folly If I stand here I saw him Fie for shame Blood hath been shed ere now i ' the olden time Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal Ay and since too murthers have been perform'd Too terrible for the ear The time has been That when the brains were out the man would die And there an end but now they rise again With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns And push us from our stools This is more strange Than such a murther is My worthy lord Your noble friends do lack you I do forget Do not muse at me my most worthy friends I have a strange infirmity which is nothing To those that know me Come love and health to all Then I 'll sit down Give me some wine fill full I drink to the general joy o ' the whole table And to our dear friend Banquo whom we miss Would he were here To all and him we thirst And all to all Our duties and the pledge Avaunt and quit my sight Let the earth hide thee Thy bones are marrowless thy blood is cold Thou hast no speculation in those eyes Which thou dost glare with Think of this good peers But as a thing of custom ' Tis no other Only it spoils the pleasure of the time What man dare I dare Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear The arm'd rhinoceros or the Hyrcan tiger Take any shape but that and my firm nerves Shall never tremble Or be alive again And dare me to the desert with thy sword If trembling I inhabit then protest me The baby of a girl Hence horrible shadow Unreal mockery hence Exit Ghost Why so being gone I am a man again Pray you sit still You have displaced the mirth broke the good meeting With most admired disorder Can such things be And overcome us like a summer 's cloud Without our special wonder You make me strange Even to the disposition that I owe When now I think you can behold such sights And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks When mine is blanch'd with fear What sights my lord I pray you speak not he grows worse and worse Question enrages him At once good night Stand not upon the order of your going But go at once Good night and better health Attend his Majesty A kind good night to all will have blood they say blood will have blood Stones have been known to move and trees to speak Augures and understood relations have By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth The secret'st man of blood What is the night Almost at odds with morning which is which How say'st thou that Macduff denies his person At our great bidding Did you send to him sir I hear it by the way but I will send There 's not a one of them but in his house I keep a servant feed I will tomorrow And betimes I will to the weird sisters More shall they speak for now I am bent to know By the worst means the worst For mine own good All causes shall give way I am in blood Stepp'd in so far that should I wade no more Returning were as tedious as go o'er Strange things I have in head that will to hand Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd You lack the season of all natures sleep Come we 'll to sleep My strange and self abuse Is the initiate fear that wants hard use We are yet but young in deed Exeunt Why how now Hecate You look angerly Have I not reason beldams as you are Saucy and overbold How did you dare To trade and traffic with Macbeth In riddles and affairs of death And I the mistress of your charms The close contriver of all harms Was never call'd to bear my part Or show the glory of our art And which is worse all you have done Hath been but for a wayward son Spiteful and wrathful who as others do Loves for his own ends not for you But make amends now Get you gone And at the pit of Acheron Meet me i ' the morning Thither he Will come to know his destiny Your vessels and your spells provide Your charms and everything beside I am for the air this night I 'll spend Unto a dismal and a fatal end Great business must be wrought ere noon Upon the corner of the moon There hangs a vaporous drop profound I 'll catch it ere it come to ground And that distill'd by magic sleights Shall raise such artificial sprites As by the strength of their illusion Shall draw him on to his confusion He shall spurn fate scorn death and bear His hopes ' bove wisdom grace and fear And you all know security Is mortals ' chiefest enemy Come let 's make haste she 'll soon be back again My former speeches have but hit your thoughts Which can interpret farther only I say Thing 's have been strangely borne The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth marry he was dead And the right valiant Banquo walk'd too late Whom you may say if't please you Fleance kill'd For Fleance fled Men must not walk too late Who can not want the thought how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father Damned fact How it did grieve Macbeth Did he not straight In pious rage the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep Was not that nobly done Ay and wisely too For ' twould have anger'd any heart alive To hear the men deny't So that I say He has borne all things well and I do think That had he Duncan 's sons under his key- As an't please heaven he shall not -they should find What ' twere to kill a father so should Fleance But peace For from broad words and 'cause he fail'd His presence at the tyrant 's feast I hear Macduff lives in disgrace Sir can you tell Where he bestows himself The son of Duncan From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth Lives in the English court and is received Of the most pious Edward with such grace That the malevolence of fortune nothing Takes from his high respect Thither Macduff Is gone to pray the holy King upon his aid To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward That by the help of these with Him above To ratify the work we may again Give to our tables meat sleep to our nights Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives Do faithful homage and receive free honors- All which we pine for now And this report Hath so exasperate the King that he Prepares for some attempt of war Sent he to Macduff He did and with an absolute Sir not I The cloudy messenger turns me his back And hums as who should say You 'll rue the time That clogs me with this answer And that well might Advise him to a caution to hold what distance His wisdom can provide Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed I 'll send my prayers with him Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd Thrice and once the hedge pig whined Harpier cries ' Tis time ' tis time Round about the cauldron go In the poison'd entrails throw Toad that under cold stone Days and nights has thirty one Swelter'd venom sleeping got Boil thou first i ' the charmed pot Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble Fillet of a fenny snake In the cauldron boil and bake Eye of newt and toe of frog Wool of bat and tongue of dog Adder 's fork and blind worm 's sting Lizard 's leg and howlet 's wing For a charm of powerful trouble Like a hell broth boil and bubble Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble Scale of dragon tooth of wolf Witch 's mummy maw and gulf Of the ravin'd salt sea shark Root of hemlock digg'd i ' the dark Liver of blaspheming Jew Gall of goat and slips of yew Sliver'd in the moon 's eclipse Nose of Turk and Tartar 's lips Finger of birth strangled babe Ditch deliver'd by a drab Make the gruel thick and slab Add thereto a tiger 's chawdron For the ingredients of our cawdron Double double toil and trouble Fire burn and cauldron bubble Cool it with a baboon 's blood Then the charm is firm and good O well done I commend your pains And everyone shall share i ' the gains And now about the cauldron sing Like elves and fairies in a ring Enchanting all that you put in By the pricking of my thumbs Something wicked this way comes Open locks Whoever knocks How now you secret black and midnight hags What is't you do A deed without a name I conjure you by that which you profess Howeer you come to know it answer me Though you untie the winds and let them fight Against the churches though the yesty waves Confound and swallow navigation up Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down Though castles topple on their warders ' heads Though palaces and pyramids do slope Their heads to their foundations though the treasure Of nature 's germaines tumble all together Even till destruction sicken answer me To what I ask you Speak Demand We 'll answer Say if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths Or from our masters ' Call 'em let me see 'em Pour in sow 's blood that hath eaten Her nine farrow grease that 's sweaten From the murtherer 's gibbet throw Into the flame Come high or low Thyself and office deftly show Tell me thou unknown power- He knows thy thought Hear his speech but say thou nought Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth Beware Macduff Beware the Thane of Fife Dismiss me Enough Whate'er thou art for thy good caution thanks Thou hast harp'd my fear aright But one word more- He will not be commanded Here 's another More potent than the first Macbeth Macbeth Macbeth Had I three ears I 'd hear thee Be bloody bold and resolute laugh to scorn The power of man for none of woman born Shall harm Macbeth Descends Then live Macduff What need I fear of thee But yet I 'll make assurance double sure And take a bond of fate thou shalt not live That I may tell pale hearted fear it lies And sleep in spite of thunder Listen but speak not to't Be lion mettled proud and take no care Who chafes who frets or where conspirers are Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill Shall come against him Descends That will never be Who can impress the forest bid the tree Unfix his earth bound root Sweet bodements good Rebellion 's head rise never till the Wood Of Birnam rise and our high placed Macbeth Shall live the lease of nature pay his breath To time and mortal custom Yet my heart Throbs to know one thing tell me if your art Can tell so much shall Banquo 's issue ever Reign in this kingdom Seek to know no more I will be satisfied Deny me this And an eternal curse fall on you Let me know Why sinks that cauldron and what noise is this Show Show WITCH Show Show his eyes and grieve his heart Come like shadows so depart Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs And thy hair Thou other gold bound brow is like the first A third is like the former Filthy hags Why do you show me this A fourth Start eyes What will the line stretch out to the crack of doom Another yet A seventh I 'll see no more And yet the eighth appears who bears a glass Which shows me many more and some I see That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry Horrible sight Now I see ' tis true For the blood bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me And points at them for his What is this so Ay sir all this is so But why Stands Macbeth thus amazedly Come sisters cheer we up his sprites And show the best of our delights I 'll charm the air to give a sound While you perform your antic round That this great King may kindly say Our duties did his welcome pay are they Gone Let this pernicious hour Stand ay accursed in the calendar Come in without there What 's your Grace 's will Saw you the weird sisters No my lord Came they not by you No indeed my lord Infected be the ' air whereon they ride And damn'd all those that trust them I did hear The galloping of horse Who wast came by ' Tis two or three my lord that bring you word Macduff is fled to England Fled to England Ay my good lord Aside Time thou anticipatest my dread exploits The flighty purpose never is o'ertook Unless the deed go with it From this moment The very firstlings of my heart shall be The firstlings of my hand And even now To crown my thoughts with acts be it thought and done The castle of Macduff I will surprise Seize upon Fife give to the edge o ' the sword His wife his babes and all unfortunate souls That trace him in his line No boasting like a fool This deed I 'll do before this purpose cool But no more sights -Where are these gentlemen Come bring me where they are Exeunt What had he done to make him fly the land You must have patience madam He had none His flight was madness When our actions do not Our fears do make us traitors You know not Whether it was his wisdom or his fear Wisdom To leave his wife to leave his babes His mansion and his titles in a place From whence himself does fly He loves us not He wants the natural touch for the poor wren The most diminutive of birds will fight Her young ones in her nest against the owl All is the fear and nothing is the love As little is the wisdom where the flight So runs against all reason My dearest coz I pray you school yourself But for your husband He is noble wise Judicious and best knows The fits o ' the season I dare not speak much further But cruel are the times when we are traitors And do not know ourselves when we hold rumor From what we fear yet know not what we fear But float upon a wild and violent sea Each way and move I take my leave of you Shall not be long but I 'll be here again Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward To what they were before My pretty cousin Blessing upon you Father'd he is and yet he 's fatherless I am so much a fool should I stay longer It would be my disgrace and your discomfort I take my leave at once Exit Sirrah your father 's dead And what will you do now How will you live As birds do Mother What with worms and flies With what I get I mean and so do they Poor bird Thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime The pitfall nor the gin Why should I Mother Poor birds they are not set for My father is not dead for all your saying Yes he is dead How wilt thou do for father Nay how will you do for a husband Why I can buy me twenty at any market Then you 'll buy 'em to sell again Thou speak'st with all thy wit and yet i ' faith With wit enough for thee Was my father a traitor Mother Ay that he was What is a traitor Why one that swears and lies And be all traitors that do so Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be And must they all be hanged that swear and lie Everyone Who must hang them Why the honest men Then the liars and swearers are fools for there are liars and swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them Now God help thee poor monkey But how wilt thou do for a father If he were dead you'ld weep for him if you would not it were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father Poor prattler how thou talk'st Bless you fair dame I am not to you known Though in your state of honor I am perfect I doubt some danger does approach you nearly If you will take a homely man 's advice Be not found here hence with your little ones To fright you thus methinks I am too savage To do worse to you were fell cruelty Which is too nigh your person Heaven preserve you I dare abide no longer Exit Whither should I fly I have done no harm But I remember now I am in this earthly world where to do harm Is often laudable to do good sometime Accounted dangerous folly Why then alas Do I put up that womanly defense To say I have done no harm -What are these faces Where is your husband I hope in no place so unsanctified Where such as thou mayst find him He 's a traitor Thou liest thou shag ear'd villain What you egg He has kill'd me Mother Run away I pray you Dies Let us seek out some desolate shade and there Weep our sad bosoms empty Let us rather Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men Bestride our downfall'n birthdom Each new morn New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows Strike heaven on the face that it resounds As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out Like syllable of dolor What I believe I 'll wall What know believe and what I can redress As I shall find the time to friend I will What you have spoke it may be so perchance This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues Was once thought honest You have loved him well He hath not touch'd you yet I am young but something You may deserve of him through me and wisdom To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb To appease an angry god I am not treacherous But Macbeth is A good and virtuous nature may recoil In an imperial charge But I shall crave your pardon That which you are my thoughts can not transpose Angels are bright still though the brightest fell Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace Yet grace must still look so I have lost my hopes Perchance even there where I did find my doubts Why in that rawness left you wife and child Those precious motives those strong knots of love Without leave taking I pray you Let not my jealousies be your dishonors But mine own safeties You may be rightly just Whatever I shall think Bleed bleed poor country Great tyranny lay thou thy basis sure For goodness dare not check thee Wear thou thy wrongs The title is affeer'd Fare thee well lord I would not be the villain that thou think'st For the whole space that 's in the tyrant 's grasp And the rich East to boot Be not offended I speak not as in absolute fear of you I think our country sinks beneath the yoke It weeps it bleeds and each new day a gash Is added to her wounds I think withal There would be hands uplifted in my right And here from gracious England have I offer Of goodly thousands But for all this When I shall tread upon the tyrant 's head Or wear it on my sword yet my poor country Shall have more vices than it had before More suffer and more sundry ways than ever By him that shall succeed What should he be It is myself I mean in whom I know All the particulars of vice so grafted That when they shall be open'd black Macbeth Will seem as pure as snow and the poor state Esteem him as a lamb being compared With my confineless harms Not in the legions Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd In evils to top Macbeth I grant him bloody Luxurious avaricious false deceitful Sudden malicious smacking of every sin That has a name But there 's no bottom none In my voluptuousness Your wives your daughters Your matrons and your maids could not fill up The cestern of my lust and my desire All continent impediments would o'erbear That did oppose my will Better Macbeth Than such an one to reign Boundless intemperance In nature is a tyranny it hath been The untimely emptying of the happy throne And fall of many kings But fear not yet To take upon you what is yours You may Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty And yet seem cold the time you may so hoodwink We have willing dames enough there can not be That vulture in you to devour so many As will to greatness dedicate themselves Finding it so inclined With this there grows In my most ill composed affection such A stanchless avarice that were I King I should cut off the nobles for their lands Desire his jewels and this other 's house And my more having would be as a sauce To make me hunger more that I should forge Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal Destroying them for wealth This avarice Sticks deeper grows with more pernicious root Than summer seeming lust and it hath been The sword of our slain kings Yet do not fear Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will Of your mere own All these are portable With other graces weigh'd But I have none The king becoming graces As justice verity temperance stableness Bounty perseverance mercy lowliness Devotion patience courage fortitude I have no relish of them but abound In the division of each several crime Acting it many ways Nay had I power I should Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell Uproar the universal peace confound All unity on earth O Scotland Scotland If such a one be fit to govern speak I am as I have spoken Fit to govern No not to live O nation miserable With an untitled tyrant bloody scepter'd When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again Since that the truest issue of thy throne By his own interdiction stands accursed And does blaspheme his breed Thy royal father Was a most sainted king the queen that bore thee Oftener upon her knees than on her feet Died every day she lived Fare thee well These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself Have banish'd me from Scotland O my breast Thy hope ends here Macduff this noble passion Child of integrity hath from my soul Wiped the black scruples reconciled my thoughts To thy good truth and honor Devilish Macbeth By many of these trains hath sought to win me Into his power and modest wisdom plucks me From over credulous haste But God above Deal between thee and me For even now I put myself to thy direction and Unspeak mine own detraction here abjure The taints and blames I laid upon myself For strangers to my nature I am yet Unknown to woman never was forsworn Scarcely have coveted what was mine own At no time broke my faith would not betray The devil to his fellow and delight No less in truth than life My first false speaking Was this upon myself What I am truly Is thine and my poor country 's to command Whither indeed before thy here approach Old Siward with ten thousand warlike men Already at a point was setting forth Now we 'll together and the chance of goodness Be like our warranted quarrel Why are you silent Such welcome and unwelcome things at once ' Tis hard to reconcile Well more anon Comes the King forth I pray you Ay sir there are a crew of wretched souls That stay his cure Their malady convinces The great assay of art but at his touch Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand They presently amend I thank you Doctor Exit Doctor What 's the disease he means ' Tis call'd the evil A most miraculous work in this good King Which often since my here remain in England I have seen him do How he solicits heaven Himself best knows but strangely visited people All swol'n and ulcerous pitiful to the eye The mere despair of surgery he cures Hanging a golden stamp about their necks Put on with holy prayers and ' tis spoken To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction With this strange virtue He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy And sundry blessings hang about his throne That speak him full of grace See who comes here My countryman but yet I know him not My ever gentle cousin welcome hither I know him now Good God betimes remove The means that makes us strangers Sir amen Stands Scotland where it did Alas poor country Almost afraid to know itself It can not Be call'd our mother but our grave Where nothing But who knows nothing is once seen to smile Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air Are made not mark'd where violent sorrow seems A modern ecstasy The dead man 's knell Is there scarce ask'd for who and good men 's lives Expire before the flowers in their caps Dying or ere they sicken O relation Too nice and yet too true What 's the newest grief That of an hour 's age doth hiss the speaker Each minute teems a new one How does my wife Why well And all my children Well too The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace No they were well at peace when I did leave 'em Be not a niggard of your speech How goest When I came hither to transport the tidings Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor Of many worthy fellows that were out Which was to my belief witness'd the rather For that I saw the tyrant 's power afoot Now is the time of help your eye in Scotland Would create soldiers make our women fight To doff their dire distresses Be't their comfort We are coming thither Gracious England hath Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men An older and a better soldier none That Christendom gives out Would I could answer This comfort with the like But I have words That would be howl'd out in the desert air Where hearing should not latch them What concern they The general cause Or is it a fee grief Due to some single breast No mind that 's honest But in it shares some woe though the main part Pertains to you alone If it be mine Keep it not from me quickly let me have it Let not your ears despise my tongue forever Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound That ever yet they heard Humh I guess at it Your castle is surprised your wife and babes Savagely slaughter'd To relate the manner Were on the quarry of these murther'd deer To add the death of you Merciful heaven What man Neer pull your hat upon your brows Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak Whispers the o'erfraught heart and bids it break My children too Wife children servants all That could be found And I must be from thence My wife kill'd too I have said Be comforted Let 's make us medicines of our great revenge To cure this deadly grief He has no children All my pretty ones Did you say all O hell kite All What all my pretty chickens and their dam At one fell swoop Dispute it like a man I shall do so But I must also feel it as a man I can not but remember such things were That were most precious to me Did heaven look on And would not take their part Sinful Macduff They were all struck for thee Naught that I am Not for their own demerits but for mine Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it O I could play the woman with mine eyes And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens Cut short all intermission front to front Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself Within my sword 's length set him if he ' scape Heaven forgive him too This tune goes manly Come go we to the King our power is ready Our lack is nothing but our leave Macbeth Is ripe for shaking and the powers above Put on their instruments Receive what cheer you may The night is long that never finds the day Exeunt I have two nights watched with you but can perceive no truth in your report When was it she last walked Since his Majesty went into the field have seen her rise from her bed throw her nightgown upon her unlock her closet take forth paper fold it write upon't read it afterwards seal it and again return to bed yet all this while in a most fast sleep A great perturbation in nature to receive at once the benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching In this slumbery agitation besides her walking and other actual performances what at any time have you heard her say That sir which I will not report after her You may to me and ' tis most meet you should Neither to you nor anyone having no witness to confirm my speech How came she by that light Why it stood by her She has light by her You see her eyes are open Ay but their sense is shut What is it she does now Look how she rubs her hands It is an accustomed action with her to seem thus washing her hands I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour Yet here 's a spot Hark she speaks I will set down what comes from her to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly Out damned spot Out I say One- two -why then ' tis time to do't Hell is murky Fie my lord fie A soldier and afeard What need we fear who knows it when none can call our power to account Yet who would have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him Do you mark that The Thane of Fife had a wife where is she now What will these hands neer be clean No more o ' that my lord no more o ' that You mar all with this starting Go to go to you have known what you should not She has spoke what she should not I am sure of that Heaven knows what she has known Here 's the smell of the blood still All the perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand Oh oh oh What a sigh is there The heart is sorely charged I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body Well well well- Pray God it be sir This disease is beyond my practice Yet I have known those which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in their beds Wash your hands put on your nightgown look not so pale I tell you yet again Banquo 's buried he can not come out on 's grave Even so To bed to bed there 's knocking at the gate Come come come come give me your hand What 's done can not be undone To bed to bed to bed Will she go now to bed Directly Foul whisperings are abroad Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets More needs she the divine than the physician God God forgive us all Look after her Remove from her the means of all annoyance And still keep eyes upon her So good night My mind she has mated and amazed my sight I think but dare not speak Good night good doctor The English power is near led on by Malcolm His uncle Siward and the good Macduff Revenges burn in them for their dear causes Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm Excite the mortified man Near Birnam Wood Shall we well meet them that way are they coming Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother For certain sir he is not I have a file Of all the gentry There is Seward 's son And many unrough youths that even now Protest their first of manhood What does the tyrant Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies Some say he 's mad others that lesser hate him Do call it valiant fury but for certain He can not buckle his distemper'd cause Within the belt of rule Now does he feel His secret murthers sticking on his hands Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith breach Those he commands move only in command Nothing in love Now does he feel his title Hang loose about him like a giant 's robe Upon a dwarfish thief Who then shall blame His pester'd senses to recoil and start When all that is within him does condemn Itself for being there Well march we on To give obedience where ' tis truly owed Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal And with him pour we in our country 's purge Each drop of us Or so much as it needs To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds Make we our march towards Birnam Exeunt marching Bring me no more reports let them fly all Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane I can not taint with fear What 's the boy Malcolm Was he not born of woman The spirits that know All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus Fear not Macbeth no man that 's born of woman Shall e'er have power upon thee Then fly false Thanes And mingle with the English epicures The mind I sway by and the heart I bear Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear There is ten thousand- Geese villain Soldiers sir Go prick thy face and over red thy fear Thou lily liver'd boy What soldiers patch Death of thy soul Those linen cheeks of thine Are counselors to fear What soldiers whey face The English force so please you Take thy face hence Exit Servant Seyton I am sick at heart When I behold- Seyton I say!- This push Will cheer me ever or disseat me now I have lived long enough My way of life Is fall'n into the sear the yellow leaf And that which should accompany old age As honor love obedience troops of friends I must not look to have but in their stead Curses not loud but deep mouth honor breath Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not Seyton What 's your gracious pleasure What news more All is confirm'd my lord which was reported I 'll fight ' til from my bones my flesh be hack'd Give me my armor ' Tis not needed yet I 'll put it on Send out more horses skirr the country round Hang those that talk of fear Give me mine armor How does your patient doctor Not so sick my lord As she is troubled with thick coming fancies That keep her from her rest Cure her of that Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow Raze out the written troubles of the brain And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart Therein the patient Must minister to himself Throw physic to the dogs I 'll none of it Come put mine armor on give me my staff Seyton send out Doctor the Thanes fly from me Come sir dispatch If thou couldst doctor cast The water of my land find her disease And purge it to a sound and pristine health I would applaud thee to the very echo That should applaud again Pull't off I say What rhubarb cyme or what purgative drug Would scour these English hence Hearst thou of them Ay my good lord your royal preparation Makes us hear something Bring it after me I will not be afraid of death and bane Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane Aside Were I from Dunsinane away and clear Profit again should hardly draw me here Exeunt Cousins I hope the days are near at hand That chambers will be safe We doubt it nothing What wood is this before us The Wood of Birnam Let every soldier hew him down a bough And bear't before him thereby shall we shadow The numbers of our host and make discovery Err in report of us It shall be done We learn no other but the confident tyrant Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure Our setting down before't ' Tis his main hope For where there is advantage to be given Both more and less have given him the revolt And none serve with him but constrained things Whose hearts are absent too Let our just censures Attend the true event and put we on Industrious soldiership The time approaches That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have and what we owe Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate But certain issue strokes must arbitrate Towards which advance the war Hang out our banners on the outward walls The cry is still They come Our castle 's strength Will laugh a siege to scorn Here let them lie Till famine and the ague eat them up Were they not forced with those that should be ours We might have met them dareful beard to beard And beat them backward home It is the cry of women my good lord Exit I have almost forgot the taste of fears The time has been my senses would have cool'd To hear a night shriek and my fell of hair Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir As life were in't I have supp'd full with horrors Direness familiar to my slaughterous thoughts Can not once start me The Queen my lord is dead She should have died hereafter There would have been a time for such a word Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow Creeps in this petty pace from day to day To the last syllable of recorded time And all our yesterdays have lighted fools The way to dusty death Out out brief candle Life 's but a walking shadow a poor player That struts and frets his hour upon the stage And then is heard no more It is a tale Told by an idiot full of sound and fury Signifying nothing Gracious my lord I should report that which I say I saw But know not how to do it Well say sir As I did stand my watch upon the hill I look'd toward Birnam and anon methought The Wood began to move Liar and slave Let me endure your wrath if't be not so Within this three mile may you see it coming I say a moving grove If thou speak'st false Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive Till famine cling thee if thy speech be sooth I care not if thou dost for me as much I pull in resolution and begin To doubt the equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth Fear not till Birnam Wood Do come to Dunsinane and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane Arm arm and out If this which he avouches does appear There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here I ' gin to be aweary of the sun And wish the estate o ' the world were now undone Ring the alarum bell Blow wind Come wrack At least we 'll die with harness on our back Exeunt Now near enough your leavy screens throw down And show like those you are You worthy uncle Shall with my cousin your right noble son Lead our first battle Worthy Macduff and we Shall take upon 's what else remains to do According to our order Fare you well Do we but find the tyrant 's power tonight Let us be beaten if we can not fight Make all our trumpets speak give them all breath Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death They have tied me to a stake I can not fly But bear like I must fight the course What 's he That was not born of woman Such a one Am I to fear or none What is thy name Thou'lt be afraid to hear it No though thou call'st thyself a hotter name Than any is in hell My name 's Macbeth The devil himself could not pronounce a title More hateful to mine ear No nor more fearful Thou wast born of woman But swords I smile at weapons laugh to scorn Brandish'd by man that 's of a woman born Exit That way the noise is Tyrant show thy face If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine My wife and children 's ghosts will haunt me still I can not strike at wretched kerns whose arms Are hired to bear their staves Either thou Macbeth Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge I sheathe again undeeded There thou shouldst be By this great clatter one of greatest note Seems bruited Let me find him Fortune And more I beg not Exit Alarums This way my lord the castle 's gently render'd The tyrant 's people on both sides do fight The noble Thanes do bravely in the war The day almost itself professes yours And little is to do We have met with foes That strike beside us Enter sir the castle Why should I play the Roman fool and die On mine own sword Whiles I see lives the gashes Do better upon them Turn hell hound turn Of all men else I have avoided thee But get thee back my soul is too much charged With blood of thine already I have no words My voice is in my sword thou bloodier villain Than terms can give thee out They fight Thou losest labor As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests I bear a charmed life which must not yield To one of woman born Despair thy charm And let the angel whom thou still hast served Tell thee Macduff was from his mother 's womb Untimely ripp'd Accursed be that tongue that tells me so For it hath cow'd my better part of man And be these juggling fiends no more believed That patter with us in a double sense That keep the word of promise to our ear And break it to our hope I 'll not fight with thee Then yield thee coward And live to be the show and gaze o ' the time We 'll have thee as our rarer monsters are Painted upon a pole and underwrit Here may you see the tyrant I will not yield To kiss the ground before young Malcolm 's feet And to be baited with the rabble 's curse Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane And thou opposed being of no woman born Yet I will try the last Before my body I throw my warlike shield Lay on Macduff And damn'd be him that first cries Hold enough I would the friends we miss were safe arrived Some must go off and yet by these I see So great a day as this is cheaply bought Macduff is missing and your noble son Your son my lord has paid a soldier 's debt He only lived but till he was a man The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd In the unshrinking station where he fought But like a man he died Then he is dead Ay and brought off the field Your cause of sorrow Must not be measured by his worth for then It hath no end Had he his hurts before Ay on the front Why then God 's soldier be he Had I as many sons as I have hairs I would not wish them to a fairer death And so his knell is knoll'd He 's worth more sorrow And that I 'll spend for him He 's worth no more They say he parted well and paid his score And so God be with him Here comes newer comfort Hail King for so thou art Behold where stands The usurper 's cursed head The time is free I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom 's pearl That speak my salutation in their minds Whose voices I desire aloud with mine- Hail King of Scotland Hail King of Scotland Flourish We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you My Thanes and kinsmen Henceforth be Earls the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named What 's more to do Which would be planted newly with the time As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiend like queen Who as ' tis thought by self and violent hands Took off her life this and what needful else That calls upon us by the grace of Grace We will perform in measure time and place So thanks to all at once and to each one Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone Escalus My lord Of government the properties to unfold Would seem in me t ' affect speech and discourse Since I am put to know that your own science Exceeds in that the lists of all advice My strength can give you then no more remains But that to your sufficiency- as your worth is able- And let them work The nature of our people Our city 's institutions and the terms For common justice y'are as pregnant in As art and practice hath enriched any That we remember There is our commission From which we would not have you warp Call hither I say bid come before us Angelo Exit an ATTENDANT What figure of us think you he will bear For you must know we have with special soul Elected him our absence to supply Lent him our terror dress'd him with our love And given his deputation all the organs Of our own power What think you of it If any in Vienna be of worth To undergo such ample grace and honour It is Lord Angelo Look where he comes Always obedient to your Grace 's will I come to know your pleasure Angelo There is a kind of character in thy life That to th ' observer doth thy history Fully unfold Thyself and thy belongings Are not thine own so proper as to waste Thyself upon thy virtues they on thee Heaven doth with us as we with torches do Not light them for themselves for if our virtues Did not go forth of us ' twere all alike As if we had them not Spirits are not finely touch'd But to fine issues nor Nature never lends The smallest scruple of her excellence But like a thrifty goddess she determines Herself the glory of a creditor Both thanks and use But I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him advertise Hold therefore Angelo- In our remove be thou at full ourself Mortality and mercy in Vienna Live in thy tongue and heart Old Escalus Though first in question is thy secondary Take thy commission Now good my lord Let there be some more test made of my metal Before so noble and so great a figure Be stamp'd upon it No more evasion We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice Proceeded to you therefore take your honours Our haste from hence is of so quick condition That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd Matters of needful value We shall write to you As time and our concernings shall importune How it goes with us and do look to know What doth befall you here So fare you well To th ' hopeful execution do I leave you Of your commissions Yet give leave my lord That we may bring you something on the way My haste may not admit it Nor need you on mine honour have to do With any scruple your scope is as mine own So to enforce or qualify the laws As to your soul seems good Give me your hand I 'll privily away I love the people But do not like to stage me to their eyes Though it do well I do not relish well Their loud applause and Aves vehement Nor do I think the man of safe discretion That does affect it Once more fare you well The heavens give safety to your purposes Lead forth and bring you back in happiness I thank you Fare you well Exit I shall desire you sir to give me leave To have free speech with you and it concerns me To look into the bottom of my place A pow'r I have but of what strength and nature I am not yet instructed ' Tis so with me Let us withdraw together And we may soon our satisfaction have Touching that point I 'll wait upon your honour Exeunt If the Duke with the other dukes come not to composition with the King of Hungary why then all the dukes fall upon the King Heaven grant us its peace but not the King of Hungary 's Amen Thou conclud'st like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the Ten Commandments but scrap'd one out of the table ' Thou shalt not steal ' Ay that he raz'd Why ' twas a commandment to command the captain and all the rest from their functions they put forth to steal There 's not a soldier of us all that in the thanksgiving before meat do relish the petition well that prays for peace I never heard any soldier dislike it I believe thee for I think thou never wast where grace was said No A dozen times at least What in metre In any proportion or in any language I think or in any religion Ay why not Grace is grace despite of all controversy as for example thou thyself art a wicked villain despite of all grace Well there went but a pair of shears between us I grant as there may between the lists and the velvet Thou art the list And thou the velvet thou art good velvet thou'rt a three pil'd piece I warrant thee I had as lief be a list of an English kersey as be pil'd as thou art pil'd for a French velvet Do I speak feelingly now I think thou dost and indeed with most painful feeling of thy speech I will out of thine own confession learn to begin thy health but whilst I live forget to drink after thee I think I have done myself wrong have I not Yes that thou hast whether thou art tainted or free Behold behold where Madam Mitigation comes I have purchas'd as many diseases under her roof as come to- To what I pray Judge To three thousand dolours a year Ay and more A French crown more Thou art always figuring diseases in me but thou art full of error I am sound Nay not as one would say healthy but so sound as things that are hollow thy bones are hollow impiety has made a feast of thee How now which of your hips has the most profound sciatica OVERDONE Well well there 's one yonder arrested and carried to prison was worth five thousand of you all Who 's that I pray thee OVERDONE Marry sir that 's Claudio Signior Claudio Claudio to prison ' Tis not so OVERDONE Nay but I know ' tis so I saw him arrested saw him carried away and which is more within these three days his head to be chopp'd off But after all this fooling I would not have it so Art thou sure of this OVERDONE I am too sure of it and it is for getting Madam Julietta with child Believe me this may be he promis'd to meet me two hours since and he was ever precise in promise keeping Besides you know it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose But most of all agreeing with the proclamation Away let 's go learn the truth of it OVERDONE Thus what with the war what with the sweat what with the gallows and what with poverty I am custom shrunk Yonder man is carried to prison OVERDONE Well what has he done A woman OVERDONE But what 's his offence Groping for trouts in a peculiar river OVERDONE What is there a maid with child by him No but there 's a woman with maid by him You have not OVERDONE What proclamation man All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be pluck'd down OVERDONE And what shall become of those in the city They shall stand for seed they had gone down too but that a wise burgher put in for them OVERDONE But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pull'd down To the ground mistress OVERDONE Why here 's a change indeed in the commonwealth What shall become of me Come fear not you good counsellors lack no clients Though you change your place you need not change your trade I 'll be your tapster still Courage there will be pity taken on you you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service you will be considered OVERDONE What 's to do here Thomas Tapster Let 's withdraw Here comes Signior Claudio led by the provost to prison and there 's Madam Juliet Exeunt Fellow why dost thou show me thus to th ' world Bear me to prison where I am committed I do it not in evil disposition But from Lord Angelo by special charge Thus can the demigod Authority Make us pay down for our offence by weight The words of heaven on whom it will it will On whom it will not so yet still ' tis just Why how now Claudio whence comes this restraint From too much liberty my Lucio liberty As surfeit is the father of much fast So every scope by the immoderate use Turns to restraint Our natures do pursue Like rats that ravin down their proper bane A thirsty evil and when we drink we die If I could speak so wisely under an arrest I would send for certain of my creditors and yet to say the truth I had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment What 's thy offence Claudio What but to speak of would offend again What is't murder No Lechery Call it so Away sir you must go One word good friend Lucio a word with you A hundred if they 'll do you any good Is lechery so look'd after Thus stands it with me upon a true contract I got possession of Julietta 's bed You know the lady she is fast my wife Save that we do the denunciation lack Of outward order this we came not to Only for propagation of a dow'r Remaining in the coffer of her friends From whom we thought it meet to hide our love Till time had made them for us But it chances The stealth of our most mutual entertainment With character too gross is writ on Juliet With child perhaps Unhappily even so And the new deputy now for the Duke- Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness Or whether that the body public be A horse whereon the governor doth ride Who newly in the seat that it may know He can command lets it straight feel the spur Whether the tyranny be in his place Or in his eminence that fills it up I stagger in But this new governor Awakes me all the enrolled penalties Which have like unscour'd armour hung by th ' wall So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round And none of them been worn and for a name Now puts the drowsy and neglected act Freshly on me ' Tis surely for a name I warrant it is and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid if she be in love may sigh it off Send after the Duke and appeal to him I have done so but he 's not to be found I prithee Lucio do me this kind service This day my sister should the cloister enter And there receive her approbation Acquaint her with the danger of my state Implore her in my voice that she make friends To the strict deputy bid herself assay him I have great hope in that for in her youth There is a prone and speechless dialect Such as move men beside she hath prosperous art When she will play with reason and discourse And well she can persuade I pray she may as well for the encouragement of the like which else would stand under grievous imposition as for the enjoying of thy life who I would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tack I 'll to her I thank you good friend Lucio Within two hours Come officer away Exeunt No holy father throw away that thought Believe not that the dribbling dart of love Can pierce a complete bosom Why I desire thee To give me secret harbour hath a purpose More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends Of burning youth May your Grace speak of it My holy sir none better knows than you How I have ever lov'd the life removed And held in idle price to haunt assemblies Where youth and cost a witless bravery keeps I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo A man of stricture and firm abstinence My absolute power and place here in Vienna And he supposes me travell'd to Poland For so I have strew'd it in the common ear And so it is received Now pious sir You will demand of me why I do this Gladly my lord We have strict statutes and most biting laws The needful bits and curbs to headstrong steeds Which for this fourteen years we have let slip Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave That goes not out to prey Now as fond fathers Having bound up the threat'ning twigs of birch Only to stick it in their children 's sight For terror not to use in time the rod Becomes more mock'd than fear'd so our decrees Dead to infliction to themselves are dead And liberty plucks justice by the nose The baby beats the nurse and quite athwart Goes all decorum It rested in your Grace To unloose this tied up justice when you pleas'd And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd Than in Lord Angelo I do fear too dreadful Sith ' twas my fault to give the people scope ' Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them For what I bid them do for we bid this be done When evil deeds have their permissive pass And not the punishment Therefore indeed my father I have on Angelo impos'd the office Who may in th ' ambush of my name strike home And yet my nature never in the fight To do in slander And to behold his sway I will as ' twere a brother of your order Visit both prince and people Therefore I prithee Supply me with the habit and instruct me How I may formally in person bear me Like a true friar Moe reasons for this action At our more leisure shall I render you Only this one Lord Angelo is precise Stands at a guard with envy scarce confesses That his blood flows or that his appetite Is more to bread than stone Hence shall we see If power change purpose what our seemers be Exeunt And have you nuns no farther privileges Are not these large enough Yes truly I speak not as desiring more But rather wishing a more strict restraint Upon the sisterhood the votarists of Saint Clare Within Ho Peace be in this place Who 's that which calls It is a man 's voice Gentle Isabella Turn you the key and know his business of him You may I may not you are yet unsworn When you have vow'd you must not speak with men But in the presence of the prioress Then if you speak you must not show your face Or if you show your face you must not speak He calls again I pray you answer him Exit FRANCISCA Peace and prosperity Who is't that calls Hail virgin if you be as those cheek roses Proclaim you are no less Can you so stead me As bring me to the sight of Isabella A novice of this place and the fair sister To her unhappy brother Claudio Why her ' unhappy brother ' Let me ask The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella and his sister Gentle and fair your brother kindly greets you Not to be weary with you he 's in prison Woe me For what For that which if myself might be his judge He should receive his punishment in thanks He hath got his friend with child Sir make me not your story It is true I would not- though ' tis my familiar sin With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest Tongue far from heart- play with all virgins so I hold you as a thing enskied and sainted By your renouncement an immortal spirit And to be talk'd with in sincerity As with a saint You do blaspheme the good in mocking me Do not believe it Fewness and truth ' tis thus Your brother and his lover have embrac'd As those that feed grow full as blossoming time That from the seedness the bare fallow brings To teeming foison even so her plenteous womb Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry Some one with child by him My cousin Juliet Is she your cousin Adoptedly as school maids change their names By vain though apt affection She it is O let him marry her This is the point The Duke is very strangely gone from hence Bore many gentlemen myself being one In hand and hope of action but we do learn By those that know the very nerves of state His givings out were of an infinite distance From his true meant design Upon his place And with full line of his authority Governs Lord Angelo a man whose blood Is very snow broth one who never feels The wanton stings and motions of the sense But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge With profits of the mind study and fast He- to give fear to use and liberty Which have for long run by the hideous law As mice by lions- hath pick'd out an act Under whose heavy sense your brother 's life Falls into forfeit he arrests him on it And follows close the rigour of the statute To make him an example All hope is gone Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer To soften Angelo And that 's my pith of business ' Twixt you and your poor brother Doth he so seek his life Has censur'd him Already and as I hear the Provost hath A warrant for his execution Alas what poor ability 's in me To do him good Assay the pow'r you have My power alas I doubt Our doubts are traitors And make us lose the good we oft might win By fearing to attempt Go to Lord Angelo And let him learn to know when maidens sue Men give like gods but when they weep and kneel All their petitions are as freely theirs As they themselves would owe them I 'll see what I can do But speedily I will about it straight No longer staying but to give the Mother Notice of my affair I humbly thank you Commend me to my brother soon at night I 'll send him certain word of my success I take my leave of you Good sir adieu Exeunt We must not make a scarecrow of the law Setting it up to fear the birds of prey And let it keep one shape till custom make it Their perch and not their terror Ay but yet Let us be keen and rather cut a little Than fall and bruise to death Alas this gentleman Whom I would save had a most noble father Let but your honour know Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue That in the working of your own affections Had time coher'd with place or place with wishing Or that the resolute acting of our blood Could have attain'd th ' effect of your own purpose Whether you had not sometime in your life Err'd in this point which now you censure him And pull'd the law upon you ' Tis one thing to be tempted Escalus Another thing to fall I not deny The jury passing on the prisoner 's life May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two Guiltier than him they try What 's open made to justice That justice seizes What knows the laws That thieves do pass on thieves ' Tis very pregnant The jewel that we find we stoop and take't Because we see it but what we do not see We tread upon and never think of it You may not so extenuate his offence For I have had such faults but rather tell me When I that censure him do so offend Let mine own judgment pattern out my death And nothing come in partial Sir he must die Be it as your wisdom will Where is the Provost Here if it like your honour See that Claudio Be executed by nine to morrow morning Bring him his confessor let him be prepar'd For that 's the utmost of his pilgrimage Exit PROVOST Aside Well heaven forgive him and forgive us all Some rise by sin and some by virtue fall Some run from breaks of ice and answer none And some condemned for a fault alone Come bring them away if these be good people in a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in common houses I know no law bring them away How now sir What 's your name and what 's the matter If it please your honour I am the poor Duke 's constable and my name is Elbow I do lean upon justice sir and do bring in here before your good honour two notorious benefactors Benefactors Well- what benefactors are they Are they not

Prove it before these varlets here thou honourable man prove it Do you hear how he misplaces Sir she came in great with child and longing saving your honour 's reverence for stew'd prunes Sir we had

go to no matter for the dish sir No indeed sir not of a pin you are therein in the right but to the point As I say this Mistress Elbow being as I say with child and being great bellied and longing as I said for prunes and having but two in the dish as I said Master Froth here this very man having eaten the rest as I said and as I say paying for them very honestly for as you know Master Froth I could not give you three pence again- No indeed Very well you being then if you be rememb'red cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes- Ay so I did indeed Why very well I telling you then if you be rememb'red that such a one and such a one were past cure of the thing you wot of unless they kept very good diet as I told you- All this is true Why very well then- Come you are a tedious fool To the purpose what was done to Elbow 's wife that he hath cause to complain of Come me to what was done to her Sir your honour can not come to that yet No sir nor I mean it not Sir but you shall come to it

good cause to whip them all I think no less Good morrow to your lordship Exit ANGELO Now sir come on what was done to Elbow 's wife once more Once?- sir There was nothing done to her once I beseech you sir ask him what this man did to my wife I beseech your honour ask me Well sir what did this gentleman to her I beseech you sir look in this gentleman 's face Good Master Froth look upon his honour ' tis for a good purpose Doth your honour mark his face Ay sir very well Nay I beseech you mark it well Well I do so Doth your honour see any harm in his face Why no I 'll be suppos'd upon a book his face is the worst thing about him Good then if his face be the worst thing about him how could Master Froth do the constable 's wife any harm I would know that of your honour He 's in the right constable what say you to it First an it like you the house is a respected house next this is a respected fellow and his mistress is a respected woman By this hand sir his wife is a more

have your action of slander too Marry I thank your good worship for it What is't your worship 's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff Truly officer because he hath some offences in him that

But the law will not allow it Pompey nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the youth of the city No Pompey Truly sir in my poor opinion they will to't then If your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaves you need not to fear the bawds There is pretty orders beginning I can tell you but it is but heading and hanging If you head and hang all

gown You are too cold if you should need a pin You could not with more tame a tongue desire it To him I say Must he needs die Maiden no remedy Yes I do think that you might pardon him And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy I will not do't But can you if you would Look what I will not that I can not do But might you do't and do the world no wrong If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse As mine is to him He 's sentenc'd ' tis too late To ISABELLA You are too cold Too late Why no I that do speak a word May call it back again Well believe this No ceremony that to great ones longs Not the king 's crown nor the deputed sword The marshal 's truncheon nor the judge 's robe Become them with one half so good a grace As mercy does If he had been as you and you as he You would have slipp'd like him but he like you Would not have been so stern Pray you be gone I would to heaven I had your potency And you were Isabel Should it then be thus No I would tell what ' twere to be a judge And what a prisoner To ISABELLA Ay touch him there 's the vein Your brother is a forfeit of the law And you but waste your words Alas Alas Why all the souls that were were forfeit once And He that might the vantage best have took Found out the remedy How would you be If He which is the top of judgment should But judge you as you are O think on that And mercy then will breathe within your lips Like man new made Be you content fair maid It is the law not I condemn your brother Were he my kinsman brother or my son It should be thus with him He must die to morrow To morrow O that 's sudden Spare him spare him He 's not prepar'd for death Even for our kitchens We kill the fowl of season shall we serve heaven With less respect than we do minister To our gross selves Good good my lord bethink you Who is it that hath died for this offence There 's many have committed it Aside Ay well said The law hath not been dead though it hath slept Those many had not dar'd to do that evil If the first that did th ' edict infringe Had answer'd for his deed Now ' tis awake Takes note of what is done and like a prophet Looks in a glass that shows what future evils- Either now or by remissness new conceiv'd And so in progress to be hatch'd and born- Are now to have no successive degrees But here they live to end Yet show some pity I show it most of all when I show justice For then I pity those I do not know Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall And do him right that answering one foul wrong Lives not to act another Be satisfied Your brother dies to morrow be content So you must be the first that gives this sentence And he that suffers O it is excellent To have a giant 's strength But it is tyrannous To use it like a giant To ISABELLA That 's well said Could great men thunder As Jove himself does Jove would never be quiet For every pelting petty officer Would use his heaven for thunder Nothing but thunder Merciful Heaven Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt Splits the unwedgeable and gnarled oak Than the soft myrtle But man proud man Dress'd in a little brief authority Most ignorant of what he 's most assur'd His glassy essence like an angry ape Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven As makes the angels weep who with our speens Would all themselves laugh mortal To ISABELLA O to him to him wench He will relent He 's coming I perceive ' t. Aside Pray heaven she win him We can not weigh our brother with ourself Great men may jest with saints ' tis wit in them But in the less foul profanation To ISABELLA Thou'rt i ' th ' right girl more o ' that That in the captain 's but a choleric word Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy To ISABELLA Art avis'd o ' that More on't Why do you put these sayings upon me Because authority though it err like others Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself That skins the vice o ' th ' top Go to your bosom Knock there and ask your heart what it doth know That 's like my brother 's fault If it confess A natural guiltiness such as is his Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue Against my brother 's life Aside She speaks and ' tis Such sense that my sense breeds with it.- Fare you well Gentle my lord turn back I will bethink me Come again to morrow Hark how I 'll bribe you good my lord turn back How bribe me Ay with such gifts that heaven shall share with you To ISABELLA You had marr'd all else Not with fond sicles of the tested gold Or stones whose rate are either rich or poor As fancy values them but with true prayers That shall be up at heaven and enter there Ere sun rise prayers from preserved souls From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate To nothing temporal Well come to me to morrow To ISABELLA Go to ' tis well away Heaven keep your honour safe Aside Amen for I Am that way going to temptation Where prayers cross At what hour to morrow Shall I attend your lordship At any time ' fore noon Save your honour Exeunt all but ANGELO From thee even from thy virtue What 's this what 's this Is this her fault or mine The tempter or the tempted who sins most Ha Not she nor doth she tempt but it is I That lying by the violet in the sun Do as the carrion does not as the flow'r Corrupt with virtuous season Can it be That modesty may more betray our sense Than woman 's lightness Having waste ground enough Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary And pitch our evils there O fie fie fie What dost thou or what art thou Angelo Dost thou desire her foully for those things That make her good O let her brother live Thieves for their robbery have authority When judges steal themselves What do I love her That I desire to hear her speak again And feast upon her eyes What is't I dream on O cunning enemy that to catch a saint With saints dost bait thy hook Most dangerous Is that temptation that doth goad us on To sin in loving virtue Never could the strumpet With all her double vigour art and nature Once stir my temper but this virtuous maid Subdues me quite Ever till now When men were fond I smil'd and wond'red how Exit Hail to you Provost so I think you are I am the Provost What 's your will good friar Bound by my charity and my blest order I come to visit the afflicted spirits Here in the prison Do me the common right To let me see them and to make me know The nature of their crimes that I may minister To them accordingly I would do more than that if more were needful When must he die As I do think to morrow To JULIET I have provided for you stay awhile And you shall be conducted Repent you fair one of the sin you carry I do and bear the shame most patiently I 'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience And try your penitence if it be sound Or hollowly put on I 'll gladly learn Love you the man that wrong'd you Yes as I love the woman that wrong'd him So then it seems your most offenceful act Was mutually committed Mutually Then was your sin of heavier kind than his I do confess it and repent it father ' Tis meet so daughter but lest you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame Which sorrow is always toward ourselves not heaven Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it But as we stand in fear- I do repent me as it is an evil And take the shame with joy There rest Your partner as I hear must die to morrow And I am going with instruction to him Grace go with you Benedicite Exit Must die to morrow O injurious law That respites me a life whose very comfort Is still a dying horror ' Tis pity of him Exeunt When I would pray and think I think and pray To several subjects Heaven hath my empty words Whilst my invention hearing not my tongue Anchors on Isabel Heaven in my mouth As if I did but only chew his name And in my heart the strong and swelling evil Of my conception The state whereon I studied Is like a good thing being often read Grown sere and tedious yea my gravity Wherein- let no man hear me- I take pride Could I with boot change for an idle plume Which the air beats for vain O place O form How often dost thou with thy case thy habit Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls To thy false seeming Blood thou art blood Let 's write ' good angel ' on the devil 's horn ' Tis not the devil 's crest One Isabel a sister desires access to you Teach her the way Exit SERVANT O heavens Why does my blood thus muster to my heart Making both it unable for itself And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitness So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons Come all to help him and so stop the air By which he should revive and even so The general subject to a well wish'd king Quit their own part and in obsequious fondness Crowd to his presence where their untaught love Must needs appear offence I am come to know your pleasure That you might know it would much better please me Than to demand what ' tis Your brother can not live Even so Heaven keep your honour Yet may he live awhile and it may be As long as you or I yet he must die Under your sentence Yea When I beseech you that in his reprieve Longer or shorter he may be so fitted That his soul sicken not Ha Fie these filthy vices It were as good To pardon him that hath from nature stol'n A man already made as to remit Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven 's image In stamps that are forbid ' tis all as easy Falsely to take away a life true made As to put metal in restrained means To make a false one ' Tis set down so in heaven but not in earth Say you so Then I shall pose you quickly Which had you rather- that the most just law Now took your brother 's life or to redeem him Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness As she that he hath stain'd Sir believe this I had rather give my body than my soul I talk not of your soul our compell'd sins Stand more for number than for accompt How say you Nay I 'll not warrant that for I can speak Against the thing I say Answer to this I now the voice of the recorded law Pronounce a sentence on your brother 's life Might there not be a charity in sin To save this brother 's life Please you to do't I 'll take it as a peril to my soul It is no sin at all but charity Pleas'd you to do't at peril of your soul Were equal poise of sin and charity That I do beg his life if it be sin Heaven let me bear it You granting of my suit If that be sin I 'll make it my morn prayer To have it added to the faults of mine And nothing of your answer Nay but hear me Your sense pursues not mine either you are ignorant Or seem so craftily and that 's not good Let me be ignorant and in nothing good But graciously to know I am no better Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright When it doth tax itself as these black masks Proclaim an enshielded beauty ten times louder Than beauty could display'd But mark me To be received plain I 'll speak more gross- Your brother is to die So And his offence is so as it appears Accountant to the law upon that pain True Admit no other way to save his life As I subscribe not that nor any other But in the loss of question that you his sister Finding yourself desir'd of such a person Whose credit with the judge or own great place Could fetch your brother from the manacles Of the all binding law and that there were No earthly mean to save him but that either You must lay down the treasures of your body To this supposed or else to let him suffer- What would you do As much for my poor brother as myself That is were I under the terms of death Th ' impression of keen whips I 'd wear as rubies And strip myself to death as to a bed That longing have been sick for ere I 'd yield My body up to shame Then must your brother die And ' twere the cheaper way Better it were a brother died at once Than that a sister by redeeming him Should die for ever Were not you then as cruel as the sentence That you have slander'd so Ignominy in ransom and free pardon Are of two houses lawful mercy Is nothing kin to foul redemption You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant And rather prov'd the sliding of your brother A merriment than a vice O pardon me my lord It oft falls out To have what we would have we speak not what we mean I something do excuse the thing I hate For his advantage that I dearly love We are all frail Else let my brother die If not a fedary but only he Owe and succeed thy weakness Nay women are frail too Ay as the glasses where they view themselves Which are as easy broke as they make forms Women help heaven Men their creation mar In profiting by them Nay call us ten times frail For we are soft as our complexions are And credulous to false prints I think it well And from this testimony of your own sex Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Than faults may shake our frames let me be bold I do arrest your words Be that you are That is a woman if you be more you 're none If you be one as you are well express'd By all external warrants show it now By putting on the destin'd livery I have no tongue but one gentle my lord Let me intreat you speak the former language Plainly conceive I love you My brother did love Juliet And you tell me that he shall die for't He shall not Isabel if you give me love I know your virtue hath a license in't Which seems a little fouler than it is To pluck on others Believe me on mine honour My words express my purpose Ha little honour to be much believ'd And most pernicious purpose Seeming seeming I will proclaim thee Angelo look for't Sign me a present pardon for my brother Or with an outstretch'd throat I 'll tell the world aloud What man thou art Who will believe thee Isabel My unsoil'd name th ' austereness of my life My vouch against you and my place i ' th ' state Will so your accusation overweigh That you shall stifle in your own report And smell of calumny I have begun And now I give my sensual race the rein Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes That banish what they sue for redeem thy brother By yielding up thy body to my will Or else he must not only die the death But thy unkindness shall his death draw out To ling'ring sufferance Answer me to morrow Or by the affection that now guides me most I 'll prove a tyrant to him As for you Say what you can my false o'erweighs your true Exit To whom should I complain Did I tell this Who would believe me O perilous mouths That bear in them one and the self same tongue Either of condemnation or approof Bidding the law make curtsy to their will Hooking both right and wrong to th ' appetite To follow as it draws I 'll to my brother Though he hath fall'n by prompture of the blood Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour That had he twenty heads to tender down On twenty bloody blocks he 'd yield them up Before his sister should her body stoop To such abhorr'd pollution Then Isabel live chaste and brother die More than our brother is our chastity I 'll tell him yet of Angelo 's request And fit his mind to death for his soul 's rest Exit So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo The miserable have no other medicine But only hope I have hope to Eve and am prepar'd to die Be absolute for death either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter Reason thus with life If I do lose thee I do lose a thing That none but fools would keep A breath thou art Servile to all the skyey influences That dost this habitation where thou keep'st Hourly afflict Merely thou art Death 's fool For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun And yet run'st toward him still Thou art not noble For all th ' accommodations that thou bear'st Are nurs'd by baseness Thou ' rt by no means valiant For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork Of a poor worm Thy best of rest is sleep And that thou oft provok'st yet grossly fear'st Thy death which is no more Thou art not thyself For thou exists on many a thousand grains That issue out of dust Happy thou art not For what thou hast not still thou striv'st to get And what thou hast forget'st Thou art not certain For thy complexion shifts to strange effects After the moon If thou art rich thou'rt poor For like an ass whose back with ingots bows Thou bear'st thy heavy riches but a journey And Death unloads thee Friend hast thou none For thine own bowels which do call thee sire The mere effusion of thy proper loins Do curse the gout serpigo and the rheum For ending thee no sooner Thou hast nor youth nor age But as it were an after dinner 's sleep Dreaming on both for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged and doth beg the alms Of palsied eld and when thou art old and rich Thou hast neither heat affection limb nor beauty To make thy riches pleasant What 's yet in this That bears the name of life Yet in this life Lie hid moe thousand deaths yet death we fear That makes these odds all even I humbly thank you To sue to live I find I seek to die And seeking death find life Let it come on Within What ho Peace here grace and good company Who 's there Come in the wish deserves a welcome Dear sir ere long I 'll visit you again Most holy sir I thank you My business is a word or two with Claudio And very welcome Look signior here 's your sister Provost a word with you As many as you please Bring me to hear them speak where I may be conceal'd Now sister what 's the comfort Why As all comforts are most good most good indeed Lord Angelo having affairs to heaven Intends you for his swift ambassador Where you shall be an everlasting leiger Therefore your best appointment make with speed To morrow you set on Is there no remedy None but such remedy as to save a head To cleave a heart in twain But is there any Yes brother you may live There is a devilish mercy in the judge If you 'll implore it that will free your life But fetter you till death Perpetual durance Ay just perpetual durance a restraint Though all the world 's vastidity you had To a determin'd scope But in what nature In such a one as you consenting to't Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear And leave you naked Let me know the point O I do fear thee Claudio and I quake Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain And six or seven winters more respect Than a perpetual honour Dar'st thou die The sense of death is most in apprehension And the poor beetle that we tread upon In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great As when a giant dies Why give you me this shame Think you I can a resolution fetch From flow'ry tenderness If I must die I will encounter darkness as a bride And hug it in mine arms There spake my brother there my father 's grave Did utter forth a voice Yes thou must die Thou art too noble to conserve a life In base appliances This outward sainted deputy Whose settled visage and deliberate word Nips youth i ' th ' head and follies doth enew As falcon doth the fowl is yet a devil His filth within being cast he would appear A pond as deep as hell The precise Angelo O ' tis the cunning livery of hell The damned'st body to invest and cover In precise guards Dost thou think Claudio If I would yield him my virginity Thou mightst be freed O heavens it can not be Yes he would give't thee from this rank offence So to offend him still This night 's the time That I should do what I abhor to name Or else thou diest to morrow Thou shalt not do't O were it but my life I 'd throw it down for your deliverance As frankly as a pin Thanks dear Isabel Be ready Claudio for your death to morrow Yes Has he affections in him That thus can make him bite the law by th ' nose When he would force it Sure it is no sin Or of the deadly seven it is the least Which is the least If it were damnable he being so wise Why would he for the momentary trick Be perdurably fin'd?- O Isabel What says my brother Death is a fearful thing And shamed life a hateful Ay but to die and go we know not where To lie in cold obstruction and to rot This sensible warm motion to become A kneaded clod and the delighted spirit To bathe in fiery floods or to reside In thrilling region of thick ribbed ice To be imprison'd in the viewless winds And blown with restless violence round about The pendent world or to be worse than worst Of those that lawless and incertain thought Imagine howling- ' tis too horrible The weariest and most loathed worldly life That age ache penury and imprisonment Can lay on nature is a paradise To what we fear of death Alas alas Sweet sister let me live What sin you do to save a brother 's life Nature dispenses with the deed so far That it becomes a virtue O you beast O faithless coward O dishonest wretch Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice Is't not a kind of incest to take life From thine own sister 's shame What should I think Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair For such a warped slip of wilderness Ne'er issu'd from his blood Take my defiance Die perish Might but my bending down Reprieve thee from thy fate it should proceed I 'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death No word to save thee Nay hear me Isabel O fie fie fie Thy sin 's not accidental but a trade Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd ' Tis best that thou diest quickly O hear me Isabella Vouchsafe a word young sister but one word What is your will Might you dispense with your leisure I would by and by have some speech with you the satisfaction I would require is likewise your own benefit I have no superfluous leisure my stay must be stolen out of other affairs but I will attend you awhile Son I have overheard what hath pass'd between you and your sister Angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her only he hath made an assay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures She having the truth of honour in her hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive I am confessor to Angelo and I know this to be true therefore prepare yourself to death Do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible to morrow you must die go to your knees and make ready Let me ask my sister pardon I am so out of love with life that I will sue to be rid of it Hold you there Farewell Exit CLAUDIO Provost a word with you What 's your will father That now you are come you will be gone Leave me a while with the maid my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company In good time Exit PROVOST The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness but grace being the soul of your complexion shall keep the body of it ever fair The assault that Angelo hath made to you fortune hath convey'd to my understanding and but that frailty hath examples for his falling I should wonder at Angelo How will you do to content this substitute and to save your brother I am now going to resolve him I had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born But O how much is the good Duke deceiv'd in Angelo If ever he return and I can speak to him I will open my lips in vain or discover his government That shall not be much amiss yet as the matter now stands he will avoid your accusation he made trial of you only Therefore fasten your ear on my advisings to the love I have in doing good a remedy presents itself I do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit redeem your brother from the angry law do no stain to your own gracious person and much please the absent Duke if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business Let me hear you speak farther I have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit Virtue is bold and goodness never fearful Have you not heard speak of Mariana the sister of Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea I have heard of the lady and good words went with her name She should this Angelo have married was affianced to her by oath and the nuptial appointed between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity her brother Frederick was wreck'd at sea having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister But mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman there she lost a noble and renowned brother in his love toward her ever most kind and natural with him the portion and sinew of her fortune her marriage dowry with both her combinate husband this well seeming Angelo Can this be so Did Angelo so leave her Left her in her tears and dried not one of them with his comfort swallowed his vows whole pretending in her discoveries of dishonour in few bestow'd her on her own lamentation which she yet wears for his sake and he a marble to her tears is washed with them but relents not What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world What corruption in this life that it will let this man live But how out of this can she avail It is a rupture that you may easily heal and the cure of it not only saves your brother but keeps you from dishonour in doing it Show me how good father This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection his unjust unkindness that in all reason should have quenched her love hath like an impediment in the current made it more violent and unruly Go you to Angelo answer his requiring with a plausible obedience agree with his demands to the point only refer yourself to this advantage first that your stay with him may not be long that the time may have all shadow and silence in it and the place answer to convenience This being granted in course- and now follows all we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment go in your place If the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter it may compel him to her recompense and here by this is your brother saved your honour untainted the poor Mariana advantaged and the corrupt deputy scaled The maid will I frame and make fit for his attempt If you think well to carry this as you may the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof What think you of it The image of it gives me content already and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection It lies much in your holding up Haste you speedily to Angelo if for this night he entreat you to his bed give him promise of satisfaction I will presently to Saint Luke 's there at the moated grange resides this dejected Mariana At that place call upon me and dispatch with Angelo that it may be quickly I thank you for this comfort Fare you well good father Nay if there be no remedy for it but that you will needs buy and sell men and women like beasts we shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard O heavens what stuff is here ' Twas never merry world since of two usuries the merriest was put down and the worser allow'd by order of law a furr'd gown to keep him warm and furr'd with fox on lamb skins too to signify that craft being richer than innocency stands for the facing Come your way sir Bless you good father friar And you good brother father What offence hath this man made you sir Marry sir he hath offended the law and sir we take him to be a thief too sir for we have found upon him sir a strange picklock which we have sent to the deputy Fie sirrah a bawd a wicked bawd The evil that thou causest to be done That is thy means to live Do thou but think What ' tis to cram a maw or clothe a back From such a filthy vice say to thyself ' From their abominable and beastly touches I drink I eat array myself and live ' Canst thou believe thy living is a life So stinkingly depending Go mend go mend Indeed it does stink in some sort sir but yet sir I would prove- Nay if the devil have given thee proofs for sin Thou wilt prove his Take him to prison officer Correction and instruction must both work Ere this rude beast will profit He must before the deputy sir he has given him warning The deputy can not abide a whoremaster if he be a whoremonger and comes before him he were as good go a mile on his errand That we were all as some would seem to be From our faults as his faults from seeming free His neck will come to your waist- a cord sir I spy comfort I cry bail Here 's a gentleman and a friend of mine How now noble Pompey What at the wheels of Caesar Art thou led in triumph What is there none of Pygmalion 's images newly made woman to be had now for putting the hand in the pocket and extracting it clutch'd What reply ha What say'st thou to this tune matter and method Is't not drown'd i ' th ' last rain ha What say'st thou trot Is the world as it was man Which is the way Is it sad and few words or how The trick of it Still thus and thus still worse How doth my dear morsel thy mistress Procures she still ha Troth sir she hath eaten up all her beef and she is herself in the tub Why ' tis good it is the right of it it must be so ever your fresh whore and your powder'd bawd- an unshunn'd consequence it must be so Art going to prison Pompey Yes faith sir Why ' tis not amiss Pompey Farewell go say I sent thee thither For debt Pompey- or how For being a bawd for being a bawd Well then imprison him If imprisonment be the due of a bawd why ' tis his right Bawd is he doubtless and of antiquity too bawd born Farewell good Pompey Commend me to the prison Pompey You will turn good husband now Pompey you will keep the house I hope sir your good worship will be my bail No indeed will I not Pompey it is not the wear I will pray Pompey to increase your bondage If you take it not patiently why your mettle is the more Adieu trusty Pompey Bless you friar And you Does Bridget paint still Pompey ha Come your ways sir come You will not bail me then sir Then Pompey nor now What news abroad friar what news Come your ways sir come Go to kennel Pompey go I know none Can you tell me of any Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia other some he is in Rome but where is he think you I know not where but wheresoever I wish him well It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state and usurp the beggary he was never born to Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence he puts transgression to't He does well in't A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him something too crabbed that way friar It is too general a vice and severity must cure it Yes in good sooth the vice is of a great kindred it is well allied but it is impossible to extirp it quite friar till eating and drinking be put down They say this Angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation Is it true think you How should he be made then Some report a sea maid spawn'd him some that he was begot between two stock fishes But it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congeal'd ice that I know to be true And he is a motion generative that 's infallible You are pleasant sir and speak apace Why what a ruthless thing is this in him for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man Would the Duke that is absent have done this Ere he would have hang'd a man for the getting a hundred bastards he would have paid for the nursing a thousand He had some feeling of the sport he knew the service and that instructed him to mercy I never heard the absent Duke much detected for women he was not inclin'd that way O sir you are deceiv'd ' Tis not possible Who- not the Duke Yes your beggar of fifty and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish The Duke had crotchets in him He would be drunk too that let me inform you You do him wrong surely Sir I was an inward of his A shy fellow was the Duke and I believe I know the cause of his withdrawing What I prithee might be the cause No pardon ' tis a secret must be lock'd within the teeth and the lips but this I can let you understand the greater file of the subject held the Duke to be wise Wise Why no question but he was A very superficial ignorant unweighing fellow Either this is envy in you folly or mistaking the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation Let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth and he shall appear to the envious a scholar a statesman and a soldier Therefore you speak unskilfully or if your knowledge be more it is much dark'ned in your malice Sir I know him and I love him Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love Come sir I know what I know I can hardly believe that since you know not what you speak But if ever the Duke return as our prayers are he may let me desire you to make your answer before him If it be honest you have spoke you have courage to maintain it I am bound to call upon you and I pray you your name Sir my name is Lucio well known to the Duke He shall know you better sir if I may live to report you I fear you not O you hope the Duke will return no more or you imagine me too unhurtful an opposite But indeed I can do you little harm you 'll forswear this again I 'll be hang'd first Thou art deceiv'd in me friar But no more of this Canst thou tell if Claudio die to morrow or no Why should he die sir Why For filling a bottle with a tun dish I would the Duke we talk of were return'd again This ungenitur'd agent will unpeople the province with continency sparrows must not build in his house eaves because they are lecherous The Duke yet would have dark deeds darkly answered he would never bring them to light Would he were return'd Marry this Claudio is condemned for untrussing Farewell good friar I prithee pray for me The Duke I say to thee again would eat mutton on Fridays He 's not past it yet and I say to thee he would mouth with a beggar though she smelt brown bread and garlic Say that I said so Farewell Exit No might nor greatness in mortality Can censure scape back wounding calumny The whitest virtue strikes What king so strong Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue But who comes here Go away with her to prison OVERDONE Good my lord be good to me your honour is accounted a merciful man good my lord Double and treble admonition and still forfeit in the same kind This would make mercy swear and play the tyrant A bawd of eleven years ' continuance may it please your honour OVERDONE My lord this is one Lucio 's information against me Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the Duke 's time he promis'd her marriage His child is a year and a quarter old come Philip and Jacob I have kept it myself and see how he goes about to abuse me That fellow is a fellow of much license Let him be call'd before us Away with her to prison Go to no more words Exeunt OFFICERS with MISTRESS OVERDONE Provost my brother Angelo will not be alter'd Claudio must die to morrow Let him be furnish'd with divines and have all charitable preparation If my brother wrought by my pity it should not be so with him So please you this friar hath been with him and advis'd him for th ' entertainment of death Good even good father Bliss and goodness on you Of whence are you Not of this country though my chance is now To use it for my time I am a brother Of gracious order late come from the See In special business from his Holiness What news abroad i ' th ' world None but that there is so great a fever on goodness that the dissolution of it must cure it Novelty is only in request and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kind of course as it is virtuous to be constant in any undertakeing There is scarce truth enough alive to make societies secure but security enough to make fellowships accurst Much upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world This news is old enough yet it is every day 's news I pray you sir of what disposition was the Duke One that above all other strifes contended especially to know himself What pleasure was he given to Rather rejoicing to see another merry than merry at anything which profess'd to make him rejoice a gentleman of all temperance But leave we him to his events with a prayer they may prove prosperous and let me desire to know how you find Claudio prepar'd I am made to understand that you have lent him visitation He professes to have received no sinister measure from his judge but most willingly humbles himself to the determination of justice Yet had he framed to himself by the instruction of his frailty many deceiving promises of life which I by my good leisure have discredited to him and now he is resolv'd to die You have paid the heavens your function and the prisoner the very debt of your calling I have labour'd for the poor gentleman to the extremest shore of my modesty but my brother justice have I found so severe that he hath forc'd me to tell him he is indeed Justice If his own life answer the straitness of his proceeding it shall become him well wherein if he chance to fail he hath sentenc'd himself I am going to visit the prisoner Fare you well Peace be with you Exeunt ESCALUS and PROVOST Break off thy song and haste thee quick away Here comes a man of comfort whose advice Hath often still'd my brawling discontent Exit BOY I cry you mercy sir and well could wish You had not found me here so musical Let me excuse me and believe me so My mirth it much displeas'd but pleas'd my woe ' Tis good though music oft hath such a charm To make bad good and good provoke to harm I pray you tell me hath anybody inquir'd for me here to day Much upon this time have I promis'd here to meet You have not been inquir'd after I have sat here all day I do constantly believe you The time is come even now I shall crave your forbearance a little May be I will call upon you anon for some advantage to yourself I am always bound to you Exit Very well met and well come What is the news from this good deputy He hath a garden circummur'd with brick Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd And to that vineyard is a planched gate That makes his opening with this bigger key This other doth command a little door Which from the vineyard to the garden leads There have I made my promise Upon the heavy middle of the night To call upon him But shall you on your knowledge find this way I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't With whispering and most guilty diligence In action all of precept he did show me The way twice o'er Are there no other tokens Between you ' greed concerning her observance No none but only a repair i ' th ' dark And that I have possess'd him my most stay Can be but brief for I have made him know I have a servant comes with me along That stays upon me whose persuasion is I come about my brother ' Tis well borne up I have not yet made known to Mariana A word of this What ho within come forth I do desire the like Do you persuade yourself that I respect you Good friar I know you do and have found it Take then this your companion by the hand Who hath a story ready for your ear I shall attend your leisure but make haste The vaporous night approaches Will't please you walk aside O place and greatness Millions of false eyes Are stuck upon thee Volumes of report Run with these false and most contrarious quest Upon thy doings Thousand escapes of wit Make thee the father of their idle dream And rack thee in their fancies She 'll take the enterprise upon her father If you advise it It is not my consent But my entreaty too Little have you to say When you depart from him but soft and low ' Remember now my brother ' Fear me not Nor gentle daughter fear you not at all He is your husband on a pre contract To bring you thus together ' tis no sin Sith that the justice of your title to him Doth flourish the deceit Come let us go Our corn 's to reap for yet our tithe 's to sow Exeunt Come hither sirrah Can you cut off a man 's head If the man be a bachelor sir I can but if he be a married man he 's his wife 's head and I can never cut of a woman 's head Come sir leave me your snatches and yield me a direct answer To morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine Here is in our prison a common executioner who in his office lacks a helper if you will take it on you to assist him it shall redeem you from your gyves if not you shall have your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance with an unpitied whipping for you have been a notorious bawd Sir I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman I would be glad to receive some instructions from my fellow partner What ho Abhorson Where 's Abhorson there Do you call sir Sirrah here 's a fellow will help you to morrow in your execution If you think it meet compound with him by the year and let him abide here with you if not use him for the present and dismiss him He can not plead his estimation with you he hath been a bawd A bawd sir Fie upon him He will discredit our mystery Go to sir you weigh equally a feather will turn the scale Exit Pray sir by your good favour- for surely sir a good favour you have but that you have a hanging look- do you call sir your occupation a mystery Ay sir a mystery Painting sir I have heard say is a mystery and your whores sir being members of my occupation using painting do prove my occupation a mystery but what mystery there should be in hanging if I should be hang'd I can not imagine Sir it is a mystery Proof Every true man 's apparel fits your thief if it be too little for your thief your true man thinks it big enough if it be too big for your thief your thief thinks it little enough so every true man 's apparel fits your thief Are you agreed Sir I will serve him for I do find your hangman is a more penitent trade than your bawd he doth oftener ask forgiveness You sirrah provide your block and your axe to morrow four o'clock Come on bawd I will instruct thee in my trade follow I do desire to learn sir and I hope if you have occasion to use me for your own turn you shall find me yare for truly sir for your kindness I owe you a good turn Call hither Barnardine and Claudio As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour When it lies starkly in the traveller 's bones He will not wake Who can do good on him Well go prepare yourself Knocking within But hark what The best and wholesom'st spirits of the night Envelop you good Provost Who call'd here of late None since the curfew rung Not Isabel No They will then ere't be long What comfort is for Claudio There 's some in hope It is a bitter deputy Not so not so his life is parallel'd Even with the stroke and line of his great justice He doth with holy abstinence subdue That in himself which he spurs on his pow'r To qualify in others Were he meal'd with that Which he corrects then were he tyrannous But this being so he 's just Knocking within Now are they There he must stay until the officer Arise to let him in he is call'd up Have you no countermand for Claudio yet But he must die to morrow None sir none As near the dawning Provost as it is You shall hear more ere morning Happily You something know yet I believe there comes No countermand no such example have we Besides upon the very siege of justice Lord Angelo hath to the public ear Profess'd the contrary And here comes Claudio 's pardon My lord hath sent you this note and by me this further charge that you swerve not from the smallest article of it neither in time matter or other circumstance Good morrow for as I take it it is almost day I shall obey him Exit MESSENGER Aside This is his pardon purchas'd by such sin For which the pardoner himself is in Hence hath offence his quick celerity When it is borne in high authority When vice makes mercy mercy 's so extended That for the fault 's love is th ' offender friended Now sir what news I told you Lord Angelo belike thinking me remiss in mine office awakens me with this unwonted putting on methinks strangely for he hath not us'd it before Pray you let 's hear Reads ' Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary let Claudio be executed by four of the clock and in the afternoon Barnardine For my better satisfaction let me have Claudio 's head sent me by five Let this be duly performed with a thought that more depends on it than we must yet deliver Thus fail not to do your office as you will answer it at your peril ' What say you to this sir What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in th ' afternoon A Bohemian born but here nurs'd up and bred One that is a prisoner nine years old How came it that the absent Duke had not either deliver'd him to his liberty or executed him I have heard it was ever his manner to do so His friends still wrought reprieves for him and indeed his fact till now in the government of Lord Angelo came not to an undoubted proof It is now apparent Most manifest and not denied by himself Hath he borne himself penitently in prison How seems he to be touch'd A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep careless reckless and fearless of what 's past present or to come insensible of mortality and desperately mortal He wants advice He will hear none He hath evermore had the liberty of the prison give him leave to escape hence he would not drunk many times a day if not many days entirely drunk We have very oft awak'd him as if to carry him to execution and show'd him a seeming warrant for it it hath not moved him at all More of him anon There is written in your brow Provost honesty and constancy If I read it not truly my ancient skill beguiles me but in the boldness of my cunning I will lay myself in hazard Claudio whom here you have warrant to execute is no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath sentenc'd him To make you understand this in a manifested effect I crave but four days ' respite for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy Pray sir in what In the delaying death Alack How may I do it having the hour limited and an express command under penalty to deliver his head in the view of Angelo I may make my case as Claudio 's to cross this in the smallest By the vow of mine order I warrant you if my instructions may be your guide Let this Barnardine be this morning executed and his head borne to Angelo Angelo hath seen them both and will discover the favour O death 's a great disguiser and you may add to it Shave the head and tie the beard and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bar'd before his death You know the course is common If anything fall to you upon this more than thanks and good fortune by the saint whom I profess I will plead against it with my life Pardon me good father it is against my oath Were you sworn to the Duke or to the deputy To him and to his substitutes You will think you have made no offence if the Duke avouch the justice of your dealing But what likelihood is in that Not a resemblance but a certainty Yet since I see you fearful that neither my coat integrity nor persuasion can with ease attempt you I will go further than I meant to pluck all fears out of you Look you sir here is the hand and seal of the Duke You know the character I doubt not and the signet is not strange to you I know them both The contents of this is the return of the Duke you shall anon over read it at your pleasure where you shall find within these two days he will be here This is a thing that Angelo knows not for he this very day receives letters of strange tenour perchance of the Duke 's death perchance entering into some monastery but by chance nothing of what is writ Look th ' unfolding star calls up the shepherd Put not yourself into amazement how these things should be all difficulties are but easy when they are known Call your executioner and off with Barnardine 's head I will give him a present shrift and advise him for a better place Yet you are amaz'd but this shall absolutely resolve you Come away it is almost clear dawn I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house of profession one would think it were Mistress Overdone 's own house for here be many of her old customers First here 's young Master Rash he 's in for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger nine score and seventeen pounds of which he made five marks ready money Marry then ginger was not much in request for the old women were all dead Then is there here one Master Caper at the suit of Master Threepile the mercer for some four suits of peach colour'd satin which now peaches him a beggar Then have we here young Dizy and young Master Deepvow and Master Copperspur and Master Starvelackey the rapier and dagger man and young Dropheir that kill'd lusty Pudding and Master Forthlight the tilter and brave Master Shootie the great traveller and wild Halfcan that stabb'd Pots and I think forty more- all great doers in our trade and are now ' for the Lord 's sake ' Sirrah bring Barnardine hither Master Barnardine You must rise and be hang'd Master Barnardine What ho Barnardine Within A pox o ' your throats Who makes that noise there What are you Your friends sir the hangman You must be so good sir to rise and be put to death Within Away you rogue away I am sleepy Tell him he must awake and that quickly too Pray Master Barnardine awake till you are executed and sleep afterwards Go in to him and fetch him out He is coming sir he is coming I hear his straw rustle Is the axe upon the block sirrah Very ready sir How now Abhorson what 's the news with you Truly sir I would desire you to clap into your prayers for look you the warrant 's come You rogue I have been drinking all night I am not fitted for't O the better sir For he that drinks all night and is hanged betimes in the morning may sleep the sounder all the next day Look you sir here comes your ghostly father Do we jest now think you Sir induced by my charity and hearing how hastily you are to depart I am come to advise you comfort you and pray with you Friar not I I have been drinking hard all night and I will have more time to prepare me or they shall beat out my brains with billets I will not consent to die this day that 's certain O Sir you must and therefore I beseech you Look forward on the journey you shall go I swear I will not die to day for any man 's persuasion But hear you- Not a word if you have anything to say to me come to my ward for thence will not I to day Exit Unfit to live or die O gravel heart After him fellows bring him to the block Now sir how do you find the prisoner A creature unprepar'd unmeet for death And to transport him in the mind he is Were damnable Here in the prison father There died this morning of a cruel fever One Ragozine a most notorious pirate A man of Claudio 's years his beard and head Just of his colour What if we do omit This reprobate till he were well inclin'd And satisfy the deputy with the visage Of Ragozine more like to Claudio O ' tis an accident that heaven provides Dispatch it presently the hour draws on Prefix'd by Angelo See this be done And sent according to command whiles I Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die This shall be done good father presently But Barnardine must die this afternoon And how shall we continue Claudio To save me from the danger that might come If he were known alive Let this be done Put them in secret holds both Barnardine and Claudio Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting To the under generation you shall find Your safety manifested I am your free dependant Quick dispatch and send the head to Angelo Here is the head I 'll carry it myself Convenient is it Make a swift return For I would commune with you of such things That want no ear but yours I 'll make all speed Exit Within Peace ho be here The tongue of Isabel She 's come to know If yet her brother 's pardon be come hither But I will keep her ignorant of her good To make her heavenly comforts of despair When it is least expected Ho by your leave Good morning to you fair and gracious daughter The better given me by so holy a man Hath yet the deputy sent my brother 's pardon He hath releas'd him Isabel from the world His head is off and sent to Angelo Nay but it is not so It is no other Show your wisdom daughter in your close patience O I will to him and pluck out his eyes You shall not be admitted to his sight Unhappy Claudio Wretched Isabel Injurious world Most damned Angelo This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot Forbear it therefore give your cause to heaven Mark what I say which you shall find By every syllable a faithful verity The Duke comes home to morrow Nay dry your eyes One of our covent and his confessor Gives me this instance Already he hath carried Notice to Escalus and Angelo Who do prepare to meet him at the gates There to give up their pow'r If you can pace your wisdom In that good path that I would wish it go And you shall have your bosom on this wretch Grace of the Duke revenges to your heart And general honour I am directed by you This letter then to Friar Peter give ' Tis that he sent me of the Duke 's return Say by this token I desire his company At Mariana 's house to night Her cause and yours I 'll perfect him withal and he shall bring you Before the Duke and to the head of Angelo Accuse him home and home For my poor self I am combined by a sacred vow And shall be absent Wend you with this letter Command these fretting waters from your eyes With a light heart trust not my holy order If I pervert your course Who 's here Good even Friar where 's the Provost Not within sir O pretty Isabella I am pale at mine heart to see thine eyes so red Thou must be patient I am fain to dine and sup with water and bran I dare not for my head fill my belly one fruitful meal would set me to't But they say the Duke will be here to morrow By my troth Isabel I lov'd thy brother If the old fantastical Duke of dark corners had been at home he had lived Exit ISABELLA Sir the Duke is marvellous little beholding to your reports but the best is he lives not in them Friar thou knowest not the Duke so well as I do he 's a better woodman than thou tak'st him for Well you 'll answer this one day Fare ye well Nay tarry I 'll go along with thee I can tell thee pretty tales of the Duke You have told me too many of him already sir if they be true if not true none were enough I was once before him for getting a wench with child Did you such a thing Yes marry did I but I was fain to forswear it they would else have married me to the rotten medlar Sir your company is fairer than honest Rest you well By my troth I 'll go with thee to the lane 's end If bawdy talk offend you we 'll have very little of it Nay friar I am a kind of burr I shall stick Exeunt Every letter he hath writ hath disvouch'd other In most uneven and distracted manner His actions show much like to madness pray heaven his wisdom be not tainted And why meet him at the gates and redeliver our authorities there I guess not And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his ent'ring that if any crave redress of injustice they should exhibit their petitions in the street He shows his reason for that to have a dispatch of Well I beseech you let it be proclaim'd Betimes i ' th ' morn I 'll call you at your house Give notice to such men of sort and suit As are to meet him I shall sir fare you well Good night Exit ESCALUS This deed unshapes me quite makes me unpregnant And dull to all proceedings A deflow'red maid And by an eminent body that enforc'd The law against it But that her tender shame Will not proclaim against her maiden loss How might she tongue me Yet reason dares her no For my authority bears a so credent bulk That no particular scandal once can touch But it confounds the breather He should have liv'd Save that his riotous youth with dangerous sense Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge By so receiving a dishonour'd life With ransom of such shame Would yet he had liv'd Alack when once our grace we have forgot Nothing goes right we would and we would not Exit These letters at fit time deliver me Giving letters The Provost knows our purpose and our plot The matter being afoot keep your instruction And hold you ever to our special drift Though sometimes you do blench from this to that As cause doth minister Go call at Flavius ' house And tell him where I stay give the like notice To Valentinus Rowland and to Crassus And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate But send me Flavius first PETER It shall be speeded well Exit FRIAR I thank thee Varrius thou hast made good haste Come we will walk There 's other of our friends Will greet us here anon My gentle Varrius Exeunt To speak so indirectly I am loath I would say the truth but to accuse him so That is your part Yet I am advis'd to do it He says to veil full purpose Be rul'd by him Besides he tells me that if peradventure He speak against me on the adverse side I should not think it strange for ' tis a physic That 's bitter to sweet end I would Friar Peter- O peace the friar is come Come I have found you out a stand most fit Where you may have such vantage on the Duke He shall not pass you Twice have the trumpets sounded The generous and gravest citizens Have hent the gates and very near upon The Duke is ent'ring therefore hence away Exeunt My very worthy cousin fairly met Our old and faithful friend we are glad to see you Many and hearty thankings to you both We have made inquiry of you and we hear Such goodness of your justice that our soul Can not but yield you forth to public thanks Forerunning more requital You make my bonds still greater O your desert speaks loud and I should wrong it To lock it in the wards of covert bosom When it deserves with characters of brass A forted residence ' gainst the tooth of time And razure of oblivion Give me your hand And let the subject see to make them know That outward courtesies would fain proclaim Favours that keep within Come Escalus You must walk by us on our other hand And good supporters are you Now is your time speak loud and kneel before him Justice O royal Duke Vail your regard Upon a wrong'd- I would fain have said a maid O worthy Prince dishonour not your eye By throwing it on any other object Till you have heard me in my true complaint And given me justice justice justice justice Relate your wrongs In what By whom Be brief Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice Reveal yourself to him O worthy Duke You bid me seek redemption of the devil Hear me yourself for that which I must speak Must either punish me not being believ'd Or wring redress from you Hear me O hear me here My lord her wits I fear me are not firm She hath been a suitor to me for her brother Cut off by course of justice- By course of justice And she will speak most bitterly and strange Most strange but yet most truly will I speak That Angelo 's forsworn is it not strange That Angelo 's a murderer is't not strange That Angelo is an adulterous thief An hypocrite a virgin violator Is it not strange and strange Nay it is ten times strange It is not truer he is Angelo Than this is all as true as it is strange Nay it is ten times true for truth is truth To th ' end of reck'ning Away with her Poor soul She speaks this in th ' infirmity of sense O Prince I conjure thee as thou believ'st There is another comfort than this world That thou neglect me not with that opinion That I am touch'd with madness Make not impossible That which but seems unlike ' tis not impossible But one the wicked'st caitiff on the ground May seem as shy as grave as just as absolute As Angelo even so may Angelo In all his dressings characts titles forms Be an arch villain Believe it royal Prince If he be less he 's nothing but he 's more Had I more name for badness By mine honesty If she be mad as I believe no other Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense Such a dependency of thing on thing As e'er I heard in madness O gracious Duke Harp not on that nor do not banish reason For inequality but let your reason serve To make the truth appear where it seems hid And hide the false seems true Many that are not mad Have sure more lack of reason What would you say I am the sister of one Claudio Condemn'd upon the act of fornication To lose his head condemn'd by Angelo I in probation of a sisterhood Was sent to by my brother one Lucio As then the messenger- That 's I an't like your Grace I came to her from Claudio and desir'd her To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo For her poor brother 's pardon That 's he indeed You were not bid to speak No my good lord Nor wish'd to hold my peace I wish you now then Pray you take note of it and when you have A business for yourself pray heaven you then Be perfect I warrant your honour The warrant 's for yourself take heed to't This gentleman told somewhat of my tale Right It may be right but you are i ' the wrong To speak before your time Proceed I went To this pernicious caitiff deputy That 's somewhat madly spoken Pardon it The phrase is to the matter Mended again The matter- proceed In brief- to set the needless process by How I persuaded how I pray'd and kneel'd How he refell'd me and how I replied For this was of much length- the vile conclusion I now begin with grief and shame to utter He would not but by gift of my chaste body To his concupiscible intemperate lust Release my brother and after much debatement My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour And I did yield to him But the next morn betimes His purpose surfeiting he sends a warrant For my poor brother 's head This is most likely O that it were as like as it is true By heaven fond wretch thou know'st not what thou speak'st Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour In hateful practice First his integrity Stands without blemish next it imports no reason That with such vehemency he should pursue Faults proper to himself If he had so offended He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself And not have cut him off Some one hath set you on Confess the truth and say by whose advice Thou cam'st here to complain And is this all Then O you blessed ministers above Keep me in patience and with ripened time Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up In countenance Heaven shield your Grace from woe As I thus wrong'd hence unbelieved go I know you 'd fain be gone An officer To prison with her Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall On him so near us This needs must be a practice Who knew of your intent and coming hither One that I would were here Friar Lodowick A ghostly father belike Who knows that Lodowick My lord I know him ' tis a meddling friar I do not like the man had he been lay my lord For certain words he spake against your Grace In your retirement I had swing'd him soundly Words against me This 's a good friar belike And to set on this wretched woman here Against our substitute Let this friar be found But yesternight my lord she and that friar I saw them at the prison a saucy friar A very scurvy fellow Blessed be your royal Grace I have stood by my lord and I have heard Your royal ear abus'd First hath this woman Most wrongfully accus'd your substitute Who is as free from touch or soil with her As she from one ungot We did believe no less Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of I know him for a man divine and holy Not scurvy nor a temporary meddler As he 's reported by this gentleman And on my trust a man that never yet Did as he vouches misreport your Grace My lord most villainously believe it Well he in time may come to clear himself But at this instant he is sick my lord Of a strange fever Upon his mere request- Being come to knowledge that there was complaint Intended ' gainst Lord Angelo- came I hither To speak as from his mouth what he doth know Is true and false and what he with his oath And all probation will make up full clear Whensoever he 's convented First for this woman- To justify this worthy nobleman So vulgarly and personally accus'd- Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes Till she herself confess it Good friar let 's hear it Exit ISABELLA guarded Do you not smile at this Lord Angelo O heaven the vanity of wretched fools Give us some seats Come cousin Angelo In this I 'll be impartial be you judge Of your own cause Pardon my lord I will not show my face Until my husband bid me What are you married No my lord Are you a maid No my lord A widow then Neither my lord Why you are nothing then neither maid widow nor wife My lord she may be a punk for many of them are neither maid widow nor wife Silence that fellow I would he had some cause To prattle for himself Well my lord My lord I do confess I ne'er was married And I confess besides I am no maid I have known my husband yet my husband Knows not that ever he knew me He was drunk then my lord it can be no better For the benefit of silence would thou wert so too Well my lord This is no witness for Lord Angelo Now I come to't my lord She that accuses him of fornication In self same manner doth accuse my husband And charges him my lord with such a time When I 'll depose I had him in mine arms With all th ' effect of love Charges she moe than me Not that I know No You say your husband Why just my lord and that is Angelo Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel 's This is a strange abuse Let 's see thy face My husband bids me now I will unmask Know you this woman Carnally she says Sirrah no more Enough my lord My lord I must confess I know this woman And five years since there was some speech of marriage Betwixt myself and her which was broke off Partly for that her promised proportions Came short of composition but in chief For that her reputation was disvalued In levity Since which time of five years I never spake with her saw her nor heard from her Upon my faith and honour Noble Prince As there comes light from heaven and words from breath As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue I am affianc'd this man 's wife as strongly As words could make up vows And my good lord But Tuesday night last gone in 's garden house He knew me as a wife As this is true Let me in safety raise me from my knees Or else for ever be confixed here A marble monument I did but smile till now Now good my lord give me the scope of justice My patience here is touch'd I do perceive These poor informal women are no more But instruments of some more mightier member That sets them on Let me have way my lord To find this practice out Ay with my heart And punish them to your height of pleasure Thou foolish friar and thou pernicious woman Compact with her that 's gone think'st thou thy oaths Though they would swear down each particular saint Were testimonies against his worth and credit That 's seal'd in approbation You Lord Escalus Sit with my cousin lend him your kind pains To find out this abuse whence ' tis deriv'd There is another friar that set them on Let him be sent for Would lie were here my lord For he indeed Hath set the women on to this complaint Your provost knows the place where he abides And he may fetch him Go do it instantly Exit PROVOST And you my noble and well warranted cousin Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth Do with your injuries as seems you best In any chastisement I for a while will leave you But stir not you till you have well determin'd Upon these slanderers My lord we 'll do it throughly Exit DUKE Signior Lucio did not you say you knew that Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person ' Cucullus non facit monachum ' honest in nothing but in his clothes and one that hath spoke most villainous speeches of the Duke We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and enforce them against him We shall find this friar a notable fellow As any in Vienna on my word Call that same Isabel here once again I would speak with her Exit an ATTENDANT Pray you my lord give me leave to question you shall see how I 'll handle her Not better than he by her own report Say you Marry sir I think if you handled her privately she would sooner confess perchance publicly she 'll be asham'd I will go darkly to work with her That 's the way for women are light at midnight Come on mistress here 's a gentlewoman denies all that you have said My lord here comes the rascal I spoke of here with the Provost In very good time Speak not you to him till we call upon you Mum Come sir did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo They have confess'd you did ' Tis false How Know you where you are Respect to your great place and let the devil Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne Where is the Duke ' Tis he should hear me speak The Duke 's in us and we will hear you speak Look you speak justly Boldly at least But O poor souls Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox Good night to your redress Is the Duke gone Then is your cause gone too The Duke 's unjust Thus to retort your manifest appeal And put your trial in the villain 's mouth Which here you come to accuse This is the rascal this is he I spoke of Why thou unreverend and unhallowed friar Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women To accuse this worthy man but in foul mouth And in the witness of his proper ear To call him villain and then to glance from him To th ' Duke himself to tax him with injustice Take him hence to th ' rack with him We 'll touze you Joint by joint but we will know his purpose What ' unjust ' Be not so hot the Duke Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he Dare rack his own his subject am I not Nor here provincial My business in this state Made me a looker on here in Vienna Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble Till it o'errun the stew laws for all faults But faults so countenanc'd that the strong statutes Stand like the forfeits in a barber 's shop As much in mock as mark Slander to th ' state Away with him to prison What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio Is this the man that you did tell us of ' Tis he my lord Come hither good man bald pate Do you know me I remember you sir by the sound of your voice I met you at the prison in the absence of the Duke O did you so And do you remember what you said of the Duke Most notedly sir Do you so sir And was the Duke a fleshmonger a fool and a coward as you then reported him to be You must sir change persons with me ere you make that my report you indeed spoke so of him and much more much worse O thou damnable fellow Did not I pluck thee by the nose for thy speeches I protest I love the Duke as I love myself Hark how the villain would close now after his treasonable abuses Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withal Away with him to prison Where is the Provost Away with him to prison Lay bolts enough upon him let him speak no more Away with those giglets too and with the other confederate companion Stay sir stay awhile What resists he Help him Lucio Come sir come sir come sir foh sir Why you bald pated lying

sit you down We 'll borrow place of him To ANGELO Sir by your leave Hast thou or word or wit or impudence That yet can do thee office If thou hast Rely upon it till my tale be heard And hold no longer out O my dread lord I should be guiltier than my guiltiness To think I can be undiscernible When I perceive your Grace like pow'r divine Hath look'd upon my passes Then good Prince No longer session hold upon my shame But let my trial be mine own confession Immediate sentence then and sequent death Is all the grace I beg Come hither Mariana Say wast thou e'er contracted to this woman I was my lord Go take her hence and marry her instantly Do you the office friar which consummate Return him here again Go with him Provost My lord I am more amaz'd at his dishonour Than at the strangeness of it Come hither Isabel Your friar is now your prince As I was then Advertising and holy to your business Not changing heart with habit I am still Attorney'd at your service O give me pardon That I your vassal have employ'd and pain'd Your unknown sovereignty You are pardon'd Isabel And now dear maid be you as free to us Your brother 's death I know sits at your heart And you may marvel why I obscur'd myself Labouring to save his life and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of my hidden pow'r Than let him so be lost O most kind maid It was the swift celerity of his death Which I did think with slower foot came on That brain'd my purpose But peace be with him That life is better life past fearing death Than that which lives to fear Make it your comfort So happy is your brother I do my lord For this new married man approaching here Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd Your well defended honour you must pardon For Mariana 's sake but as he adjudg'd your brother- Being criminal in double violation Of sacred chastity and of promise breach Thereon dependent for your brother 's life- The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible even from his proper tongue ' An Angelo for Claudio death for death ' Haste still pays haste and leisure answers leisure Like doth quit like and Measure still for Measure Then Angelo thy fault 's thus manifested Which though thou wouldst deny denies thee vantage We do condemn thee to the very block Where Claudio stoop'd to death and with like haste Away with him O my most gracious lord I hope you will not mock me with a husband It is your husband mock'd you with a husband Consenting to the safeguard of your honour I thought your marriage fit else imputation For that he knew you might reproach your life And choke your good to come For his possessions Although by confiscation they are ours We do instate and widow you withal To buy you a better husband O my dear lord I crave no other nor no better man Never crave him we are definitive Gentle my liege- Kneeling You do but lose your labour Away with him to death To LUCIO Now sir to you O my good lord Sweet Isabel take my part Lend me your knees and all my life to come I 'll lend you all my life to do you service Against all sense you do importune her Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact Her brother 's ghost his paved bed would break And take her hence in horror Isabel Sweet Isabel do yet but kneel by me Hold up your hands say nothing I 'll speak all They say best men moulded out of faults And for the most become much more the better For being a little bad so may my husband O Isabel will you not lend a knee He dies for Claudio 's death Kneeling Most bounteous sir Look if it please you on this man condemn'd As if my brother liv'd I partly think A due sincerity govern'd his deeds Till he did look on me since it is so Let him not die My brother had but justice In that he did the thing for which he died For Angelo His act did not o'ertake his bad intent And must be buried but as an intent That perish'd by the way Thoughts are no subjects Intents but merely thoughts Merely my lord Your suit 's unprofitable stand up I say I have bethought me of another fault Provost how came it Claudio was beheaded At an unusual hour It was commanded so Had you a special warrant for the deed No my good lord it was by private message For which I do discharge you of your office Give up your keys Pardon me noble lord I thought it was a fault but knew it not Yet did repent me after more advice For testimony whereof one in the prison That should by private order else have died I have reserv'd alive What 's he His name is Barnardine I would thou hadst done so by Claudio Go fetch him hither let me look upon him Exit PROVOST I am sorry one so learned and so wise As you Lord Angelo have still appear'd Should slip so grossly both in the heat of blood And lack of temper'd judgment afterward I am sorry that such sorrow I procure And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart That I crave death more willingly than mercy ' Tis my deserving and I do entreat it Which is that Barnardine This my lord There was a friar told me of this man Sirrah thou art said to have a stubborn soul That apprehends no further than this world And squar'st thy life according Thou'rt condemn'd But for those earthly faults I quit them all And pray thee take this mercy to provide For better times to come Friar advise him I leave him to your hand What muffl'd fellow 's that This is another prisoner that I sav'd Who should have died when Claudio lost his head As like almost to Claudio as himself Unmuffles CLAUDIO To ISABELLA If he be like your brother for his sake Is he pardon'd and for your lovely sake Give me your hand and say you will be mine He is my brother too But fitter time for that By this Lord Angelo perceives he 's safe Methinks I see a quick'ning in his eye Well Angelo your evil quits you well Look that you love your wife her worth worth yours I find an apt remission in myself And yet here 's one in place I can not pardon To Lucio You sirrah that knew me for a fool a coward One all of luxury an ass a madman Wherein have I so deserv'd of you That you extol me thus Faith my lord I spoke it but according to the trick If you will hang me for it you may but I had rather it would please you I might be whipt Whipt first sir and hang'd after Proclaim it Provost round about the city If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow- As I have heard him swear himself there 's one Whom he begot with child let her appear And he shall marry her The nuptial finish'd Let him be whipt and hang'd I beseech your Highness do not marry me to a whore Your Highness said even now I made you a duke good my lord do not recompense me in making me a cuckold Upon mine honour thou shalt marry her Thy slanders I forgive and therewithal Remit thy other forfeits Take him to prison And see our pleasure herein executed Marrying a punk my lord is pressing to death whipping and hanging Slandering a prince deserves it In sooth I know not why I am so sad It wearies me you say it wearies you But how I caught it found it or came by it What stuff ' tis made of whereof it is born I am to learn And such a want wit sadness makes of me That I have much ado to know myself Your mind is tossing on the ocean There where your argosies with portly sail- Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood Or as it were the pageants of the sea- Do overpeer the petty traffickers That curtsy to them do them reverence As they fly by them with their woven wings Believe me sir had I such venture forth The better part of my affections would Be with my hopes abroad I should be still Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads And every object that might make me fear Misfortune to my ventures out of doubt Would make me sad My wind cooling my broth Would blow me to an ague when I thought What harm a wind too great might do at sea I should not see the sandy hour glass run But I should think of shallows and of flats And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand Vailing her high top lower than her ribs To kiss her burial Should I go to church And see the holy edifice of stone And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks Which touching but my gentle vessel 's side Would scatter all her spices on the stream Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks And in a word but even now worth this And now worth nothing Shall I have the thought To think on this and shall I lack the thought That such a thing bechanc'd would make me sad But tell not me I know Antonio Is sad to think upon his merchandise Believe me no I thank my fortune for it My ventures are not in one bottom trusted Nor to one place nor is my whole estate Upon the fortune of this present year Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad Why then you are in love Fie fie Not in love neither Then let us say you are sad Because you are not merry and ' twere as easy For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry Because you are not sad Now by two headed Janus Nature hath fram'd strange fellows in her time Some that will evermore peep through their eyes And laugh like parrots at a bag piper And other of such vinegar aspect That they 'll not show their teeth in way of smile Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable I would have stay'd till I had made you merry If worthier friends had not prevented me Your worth is very dear in my regard I take it your own business calls on you And you embrace th ' occasion to depart Good morrow my good lords Good signiors both when shall we laugh Say when You grow exceeding strange must it be so We 'll make our leisures to attend on yours My Lord Bassanio since you have found Antonio We two will leave you but at dinner time I pray you have in mind where we must meet I will not fail you You look not well Signior Antonio You have too much respect upon the world They lose it that do buy it with much care Believe me you are marvellously chang'd I hold the world but as the world Gratiano- A stage where every man must play a part And mine a sad one Let me play the fool With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come And let my liver rather heat with wine Than my heart cool with mortifying groans Why should a man whose blood is warm within Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice By being peevish I tell thee what Antonio- I love thee and ' tis my love that speaks- There are a sort of men whose visages Do cream and mantle like a standing pond And do a wilful stillness entertain With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion Of wisdom gravity profound conceit As who should say ' I am Sir Oracle And when I ope my lips let no dog bark ' O my Antonio I do know of these That therefore only are reputed wise For saying nothing when I am very sure If they should speak would almost damn those ears Which hearing them would call their brothers fools I 'll tell thee more of this another time But fish not with this melancholy bait For this fool gudgeon this opinion Come good Lorenzo Fare ye well awhile I 'll end my exhortation after dinner Well we will leave you then till dinner time I must be one of these same dumb wise men For Gratiano never lets me speak Well keep me company but two years moe Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue Fare you well I 'll grow a talker for this gear Thanks i ' faith for silence is only commendable In a neat 's tongue dried and a maid not vendible Is that anything now Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all Venice His reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search Well tell me now what lady is the same To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage That you to day promis'd to tell me of ' Tis not unknown to you Antonio How much I have disabled mine estate By something showing a more swelling port Than my faint means would grant continuance Nor do I now make moan to be abridg'd From such a noble rate but my chief care Is to come fairly off from the great debts Wherein my time something too prodigal Hath left me gag'd To you Antonio I owe the most in money and in love And from your love I have a warranty To unburden all my plots and purposes How to get clear of all the debts I owe I pray you good Bassanio let me know it And if it stand as you yourself still do Within the eye of honour be assur'd My purse my person my extremest means Lie all unlock'd to your occasions In my school days when I had lost one shaft I shot his fellow of the self same flight The self same way with more advised watch To find the other forth and by adventuring both I oft found both I urge this childhood proof Because what follows is pure innocence I owe you much and like a wilful youth That which I owe is lost but if you please To shoot another arrow that self way Which you did shoot the first I do not doubt As I will watch the aim or to find both Or bring your latter hazard back again And thankfully rest debtor for the first You know me well and herein spend but time To wind about my love with circumstance And out of doubt you do me now more wrong In making question of my uttermost Than if you had made waste of all I have Then do but say to me what I should do That in your knowledge may by me be done And I am prest unto it therefore speak In Belmont is a lady richly left And she is fair and fairer than that word Of wondrous virtues Sometimes from her eyes I did receive fair speechless messages Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu'd To Cato 's daughter Brutus ' Portia Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth For the four winds blow in from every coast Renowned suitors and her sunny locks Hang on her temples like a golden fleece Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos ' strond And many Jasons come in quest of her O my Antonio had I but the means To hold a rival place with one of them I have a mind presages me such thrift That I should questionless be fortunate Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea Neither have I money nor commodity To raise a present sum therefore go forth Try what my credit can in Venice do That shall be rack'd even to the uttermost To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia Go presently inquire and so will I Where money is and I no question make To have it of my trust or for my sake Exeunt By my troth Nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world You would be sweet madam if your miseries were in the same abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught I see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing It is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity come sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer Good sentences and well pronounc'd They would be better if well followed If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor men 's cottages princes ' palaces It is a good divine that follows his own instructions I can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching The brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps o'er a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the cripple But this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband O me the word ' choose ' I may neither choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike so is the will of a living daughter curb'd by the will of a dead father Is it not hard Nerissa that I can not choose one nor refuse none Your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lott'ry that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead- whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love But what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come I pray thee over name them and as thou namest them I will describe them and according to my description level at my affection First there is the Neapolitan prince Ay that 's a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself I am much afear'd my lady his mother play'd false with a smith Then is there the County Palatine He doth nothing but frown as who should say ' An you will not have me choose ' He hears merry tales and smiles not I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth I had rather be married to a death's head with a bone in his mouth than to either of these God defend me from these two How say you by the French lord Monsieur Le Bon God made him and therefore let him pass for a man In truth I know it is a sin to be a mocker but he- why he hath a horse better than the Neapolitan 's a better bad habit of frowning than the Count Palatine he is every man in no man If a throstle sing he falls straight a cap'ring he will fence with his own shadow if I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands If he would despise me I would forgive him for if he love me to madness I shall never requite him What say you then to Falconbridge the young baron of England You know I say nothing to him for he understands not me nor I him he hath neither Latin French nor Italian and you will come into the court and swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English He is a proper man 's picture but alas who can converse with a dumb show How oddly he is suited I think he bought his doublet in Italy his round hose in France his bonnet in Germany and his behaviour everywhere What think you of the Scottish lord his neighbour That he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able I think the Frenchman became his surety and seal'd under for another How like you the young German the Duke of Saxony 's nephew Very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk When he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast An the worst fall that ever fell I hope I shall make shift to go without him If he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your father 's will if you should refuse to accept him Therefore for fear of the worst I pray thee set a deep glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without I know he will choose it I will do anything Nerissa ere I will be married to a sponge You need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your father 's imposition depending on the caskets If I live to be as old as Sibylla I will die as chaste as Diana unless I be obtained by the manner of my father 's will I am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but I dote on his very absence and I pray God grant them a fair departure Do you not remember lady in your father 's time a Venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the Marquis of Montferrat Yes yes it was Bassanio as I think so was he call'd True madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes look'd upon was the best deserving a fair lady I remember him well and I remember him worthy of thy praise The four strangers seek for you madam to take their leave and there is a forerunner come from a fifth the Prince of Morocco who brings word the Prince his master will be here to night If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as I can bid the other four farewell I should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil I had rather he should shrive me than wive me Come Nerissa Sirrah go before Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer another knocks at the Three thousand ducats- well Ay sir for three months For three months- well For the which as I told you Antonio shall be bound Antonio shall become bound- well May you stead me Will you pleasure me Shall I know your answer Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound Your answer to that Antonio is a good man Have you heard any imputation to the contrary Ho no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis another to the Indies I understand moreover upon the Rialto he hath a third at Mexico a fourth for England- and other ventures he hath squand'red abroad But ships are but boards sailors but men there be land rats and water rats water thieves and land thieves- I mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks The man is notwithstanding sufficient Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his bond Be assur'd you may I will be assur'd I may and that I may be assured I will bethink me May I speak with Antonio If it please you to dine with us Yes to smell pork to eat of the habitation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into I will buy with you sell with you talk with you walk with you and so following but I will not eat with you drink with you nor pray with you What news on the Rialto Who is he comes here This is Signior Antonio Aside How like a fawning publican he looks I hate him for he is a Christian But more for that in low simplicity He lends out money gratis and brings down The rate of usance here with us in Venice If I can catch him once upon the hip I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him He hates our sacred nation and he rails Even there where merchants most do congregate On me my bargains and my well won thrift Which he calls interest Cursed be my tribe If I forgive him Shylock do you hear I am debating of my present store And by the near guess of my memory I can not instantly raise up the gross Of full three thousand ducats What of that Tubal a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe Will furnish me But soft how many months Do you desire To ANTONIO Rest you fair good signior Your worship was the last man in our mouths Shylock albeit I neither lend nor borrow By taking nor by giving of excess Yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend I 'll break a custom To BASSANIO Is he yet possess'd How much ye would Ay ay three thousand ducats And for three months I had forgot- three months you told me so Well then your bond and let me see- but hear you Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow Upon advantage I do never use it When Jacob graz'd his uncle Laban 's sheep- This Jacob from our holy Abram was As his wise mother wrought in his behalf The third possessor ay he was the third- And what of him Did he take interest No not take interest not as you would say Directly int'rest mark what Jacob did When Laban and himself were compromis'd That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied Should fall as Jacob 's hire the ewes being rank In end of autumn turned to the rams And when the work of generation was Between these woolly breeders in the act The skilful shepherd pill'd me certain wands And in the doing of the deed of kind He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes Who then conceiving did in eaning time Fall parti colour'd lambs and those were Jacob 's This was a way to thrive and he was blest And thrift is blessing if men steal it not This was a venture sir that Jacob serv'd for A thing not in his power to bring to pass But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven Was this inserted to make interest good Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams I can not tell I make it breed as fast But note me signior Aside Mark you this Bassanio The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose An evil soul producing holy witness Is like a villain with a smiling cheek A goodly apple rotten at the heart O what a goodly outside falsehood hath Three thousand ducats- ' tis a good round sum Three months from twelve then let me see the rate- Well Shylock shall we be beholding to you Signior Antonio many a time and oft In the Rialto you have rated me About my moneys and my usances Still have I borne it with a patient shrug For suff'rance is the badge of all our tribe You call me misbeliever cut throat dog And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine And all for use of that which is mine own Well then it now appears you need my help Go to then you come to me and you say ' Shylock we would have moneys ' You say so- You that did void your rheum upon my beard And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur Over your threshold moneys is your suit What should I say to you Should I not say ' Hath a dog money Is it possible A cur can lend three thousand ducats ' Or Shall I bend low and in a bondman 's key With bated breath and whisp'ring humbleness Say this ' Fair sir you spit on me on Wednesday last You spurn'd me such a day another time You call'd me dog and for these courtesies I 'll lend you thus much moneys ' I am as like to call thee so again To spit on thee again to spurn thee too If thou wilt lend this money lend it not As to thy friends- for when did friendship take A breed for barren metal of his friend?- But lend it rather to thine enemy Who if he break thou mayst with better face Exact the penalty Why look you how you storm I would be friends with you and have your love Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with Supply your present wants and take no doit Of usance for my moneys and you 'll not hear me This is kind I offer This were kindness This kindness will I show Go with me to a notary seal me there Your single bond and in a merry sport If you repay me not on such a day In such a place such sum or sums as are Express'd in the condition let the forfeit Be nominated for an equal pound Of your fair flesh to be cut off and taken In what part of your body pleaseth me Content in faith I 'll seal to such a bond And say there is much kindness in the Jew You shall not seal to such a bond for me I 'll rather dwell in my necessity Why fear not man I will not forfeit it Within these two months- that 's a month before This bond expires- I do expect return Of thrice three times the value of this bond O father Abram what these Christians are Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect The thoughts of others Pray you tell me this If he should break his day what should I gain By the exaction of the forfeiture A pound of man 's flesh taken from a man Is not so estimable profitable neither As flesh of muttons beefs or goats I say To buy his favour I extend this friendship If he will take it so if not adieu And for my love I pray you wrong me not Yes Shylock I will seal unto this bond Then meet me forthwith at the notary 's Give him direction for this merry bond And I will go and purse the ducats straight See to my house left in the fearful guard Of an unthrifty knave and presently I 'll be with you Hie thee gentle Jew Exit SHYLOCK The Hebrew will turn Christian he grows kind I like not fair terms and a villain 's mind Come on in this there can be no dismay My ships come home a month before the day Exeunt In terms of choice I am not solely led By nice direction of a maiden 's eyes Besides the lott'ry of my destiny Bars me the right of voluntary choosing But if my father had not scanted me And hedg'd me by his wit to yield myself His wife who wins me by that means I told you Yourself renowned Prince then stood as fair As any comer I have look'd on yet For my affection Even for that I thank you Therefore I pray you lead me to the caskets To try my fortune By this scimitar That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince That won three fields of Sultan Solyman I would o'erstare the sternest eyes that look Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she bear Yea mock the lion when ' a roars for prey To win thee lady But alas the while If Hercules and Lichas play at dice Which is the better man the greater throw May turn by fortune from the weaker band So is Alcides beaten by his page And so may I blind Fortune leading me Miss that which one unworthier may attain And die with grieving You must take your chance And either not attempt to choose at all Or swear before you choose if you choose wrong Never to speak to lady afterward In way of marriage therefore be advis'd Nor will not come bring me unto my chance First forward to the temple After dinner Your hazard shall be made Good fortune then To make me blest or cursed'st among men Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from this Jew my master The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me saying to me ' Gobbo Launcelot Gobbo good Launcelot ' or ' good Gobbo ' or ' good Launcelot Gobbo use your legs take the start run away ' My conscience says ' No take heed honest Launcelot take heed honest Gobbo ' or as aforesaid ' honest Launcelot Gobbo do not run scorn running with thy heels ' Well the most courageous fiend bids me pack ' Via ' says the fiend ' away ' says the fiend ' For the heavens rouse up a brave mind ' says the fiend ' and run ' Well my conscience hanging about the neck of my heart says very wisely to me ' My honest friend Launcelot being an honest man 's son ' or rather ' an honest woman 's son ' for indeed my father did something smack something grow to he had a kind of taste- well my conscience says ' Launcelot budge not ' ' Budge ' says the fiend ' Budge not ' says my conscience ' Conscience ' say I you counsel well ' ' Fiend ' say I ' you counsel well ' To be rul'd by my conscience I should stay with the Jew my master who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of devil and to run away from the Jew I should be ruled by the fiend who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself Certainly the Jew is the very devil incarnation and in my conscience my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew The fiend gives the more friendly counsel I will run fiend my heels are at your commandment I will run Master young man you I pray you which is the way to master Jew 's Aside O heavens This is my true begotten father who being more than sand blind high gravel blind knows me not I will try confusions with him Master young gentleman I pray you which is the way to master Jew 's Turn up on your right hand at the next turning but at the next turning of all on your left marry at the very next turning turn of no hand but turn down indirectly to the Jew 's house Be God 's sonties ' twill be a hard way to hit Can you tell me whether one Launcelot that dwells with him dwell with him or no Talk you of young Master Launcelot Aside Mark me now now will I raise the waters.- Talk you of young Master Launcelot No master sir but a poor man 's son his father though I say't is an honest exceeding poor man and God be thanked well to live Well let his father be what ' a will we talk of young Master Launcelot Your worship 's friend and Launcelot sir But I pray you ergo old man ergo I beseech you talk you of young Master Launcelot Of Launcelot an't please your mastership Ergo Master Launcelot Talk not of Master Launcelot father for the young gentleman according to Fates and Destinies and such odd sayings the Sisters Three and such branches of learning is indeed deceased or as you would say in plain terms gone to heaven Marry God forbid The boy was the very staff of my age my very prop Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel post a staff or a prop Do you know me father Alack the day I know you not young gentleman but I pray you tell me is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead Do you not know me father Alack sir I am sand blind I know you not Nay indeed if you had your eyes you might fail of the knowing me it is a wise father that knows his own child Well old man I will tell you news of your son Give me your blessing truth will come to light murder can not be hid long a man 's son may but in the end truth will out Pray you sir stand up I am sure you are not Launcelot my boy Pray you let 's have no more fooling about it but give me your blessing I am Launcelot your boy that was your son that is your child that shall be I can not think you are my son I know not what I shall think of that but I am Launcelot the Jew 's man and I am sure Margery your wife is my mother Her name is Margery indeed I 'll be sworn if thou be Launcelot thou art mine own flesh and blood Lord worshipp'd might he be what a beard hast thou got Thou hast got more hair on thy chin than Dobbin my fill horse has on his tail It should seem then that Dobbin 's tail grows backward I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face when I last saw him Lord how art thou chang'd How dost thou and thy master agree I have brought him a present How ' gree you now Well well but for mine own part as I have set up my rest to run away so I will not rest till I have run some ground My master 's a very Jew Give him a present Give him a halter I am famish'd in his service you may tell every finger I have with my ribs Father I am glad you are come give me your present to one Master Bassanio who indeed gives rare new liveries if I serve not him I will run as far as God has any ground O rare fortune Here comes the man To him father for I am a Jew if I serve the Jew any longer You may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock See these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging Exit a SERVANT To him father God bless your worship Gramercy wouldst thou aught with me Here 's my son sir a poor boy- Not a poor boy sir but the rich Jew 's man that would sir as my father shall specify- He hath a great infection sir as one would say to serve- Indeed the short and the long is I serve the Jew and have a desire as my father shall specify- His master and he saving your worship 's reverence are scarce cater cousins- To be brief the very truth is that the Jew having done me wrong doth cause me as my father being I hope an old man shall frutify unto you- I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon your worship and my suit is- In very brief the suit is impertinent to myself as your worship shall know by this honest old man and though I say it though old man yet poor man my father One speak for both What would you Serve you sir That is the very defect of the matter sir I know thee well thou hast obtain'd thy suit Shylock thy master spoke with me this day And hath preferr'd thee if it be preferment To leave a rich Jew 's service to become The follower of so poor a gentleman The old proverb is very well parted between my master Shylock and you sir you have the grace of God sir and he hath enough Thou speak'st it well Go father with thy son Take leave of thy old master and inquire My lodging out To a SERVANT Give him a livery More guarded than his fellows ' see it done Father in I can not get a service no I have ne'er a tongue in my head Looking on his palm Well if any man in Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a book- I shall have good fortune Go to here 's a simple line of life here 's a small trifle of wives alas fifteen wives is nothing a'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming in for one man And then to scape drowning thrice and to be in peril of my life with the edge of a feather bed here are simple scapes Well if Fortune be a woman she 's a good wench for this gear Father come I 'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling I pray thee good Leonardo think on this These things being bought and orderly bestowed Return in haste for I do feast to night My best esteem'd acquaintance hie thee go My best endeavours shall be done herein Where 's your master Yonder sir he walks Exit Signior Bassanio Gratiano I have suit to you You have obtain'd it You must not deny me I must go with you to Belmont Why then you must But hear thee Gratiano Thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice- Parts that become thee happily enough And in such eyes as ours appear not faults But where thou art not known why there they show Something too liberal Pray thee take pain To allay with some cold drops of modesty Thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behaviour I be misconst'red in the place I go to And lose my hopes Signior Bassanio hear me If I do not put on a sober habit Talk with respect and swear but now and then Wear prayer books in my pocket look demurely Nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes Thus with my hat and sigh and say amen Use all the observance of civility Like one well studied in a sad ostent To please his grandam never trust me more Well we shall see your bearing Nay but I bar to night you shall not gauge me By what we do to night No that were pity I would entreat you rather to put on Your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends That purpose merriment But fare you well I have some business And I must to Lorenzo and the rest But we will visit you at supper time Exeunt I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so Our house is hell and thou a merry devil Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness But fare thee well there is a ducat for thee And Launcelot soon at supper shalt thou see Lorenzo who is thy new master 's guest Give him this letter do it secretly And so farewell I would not have my father See me in talk with thee Adieu tears exhibit my tongue Most beautiful pagan most sweet Jew If a Christian do not play the knave and get thee I am much deceived But adieu these foolish drops do something drown my manly spirit adieu Farewell good Launcelot Exit LAUNCELOT Alack what heinous sin is it in me To be asham'd to be my father 's child But though I am a daughter to his blood I am not to his manners O Lorenzo If thou keep promise I shall end this strife Become a Christian and thy loving wife Exit Nay we will slink away in suppertime Disguise us at my lodging and return All in an hour We have not made good preparation We have not spoke us yet of torch bearers ' Tis vile unless it may be quaintly ordered And better in my mind not undertook ' Tis now but four o'clock we have two hours To furnish us An it shall please you to break up this it shall seem to signify I know the hand in faith ' tis a fair hand And whiter than the paper it writ on Is the fair hand that writ Love news in faith By your leave sir Whither goest thou Marry sir to bid my old master the Jew to sup to night with my new master the Christian Hold here take this Tell gentle Jessica I will not fail her speak it privately Go gentlemen Exit LAUNCELOT Will you prepare you for this masque to night I am provided of a torch bearer Ay marry I 'll be gone about it straight And so will I. Meet me and Gratiano At Gratiano 's lodging some hour hence ' Tis good we do so Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO Was not that letter from fair Jessica I must needs tell thee all She hath directed How I shall take her from her father 's house What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with What page 's suit she hath in readiness If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven It will be for his gentle daughter 's sake And never dare misfortune cross her foot Unless she do it under this excuse That she is issue to a faithless Jew Come go with me peruse this as thou goest Fair Jessica shall be my torch bearer Exeunt Well thou shalt see thy eyes shall be thy judge The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.- What Jessica!- Thou shalt not gormandize As thou hast done with me- What Jessica!- And sleep and snore and rend apparel out- Why Jessica I say Why Jessica Who bids thee call I do not bid thee call Your worship was wo nt to tell me I could do nothing without bidding Call you What is your will I am bid forth to supper Jessica There are my keys But wherefore should I go I am not bid for love they flatter me But yet I 'll go in hate to feed upon The prodigal Christian Jessica my girl Look to my house I am right loath to go There is some ill a brewing towards my rest For I did dream of money bags to night I beseech you sir go my young master doth expect your reproach So do I his And they have conspired together I will not say you shall see a masque but if you do then it was not for nothing that my nose fell a bleeding on Black Monday last at six o'clock i ' th ' morning falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was four year in th ' afternoon What are there masques Hear you me Jessica Lock up my doors and when you hear the drum And the vile squealing of the wry neck'd fife Clamber not you up to the casements then Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces But stop my house 's ears- I mean my casements Let not the sound of shallow fopp'ry enter My sober house By Jacob 's staff I swear I have no mind of feasting forth to night But I will go Go you before me sirrah Say I will come I will go before sir Mistress look out at window for all this What says that fool of Hagar 's offspring ha His words were ' Farewell mistress ' nothing else The patch is kind enough but a huge feeder Snail slow in profit and he sleeps by day More than the wild cat drones hive not with me Therefore I part with him and part with him To one that I would have him help to waste His borrowed purse Well Jessica go in Perhaps I will return immediately Do as I bid you shut doors after you Fast bind fast find- A proverb never stale in thrifty mind Exit Farewell and if my fortune be not crost I have a father you a daughter lost Exit This is the pent house under which Lorenzo Desired us to make stand His hour is almost past And it is marvel he out dwells his hour For lovers ever run before the clock O ten times faster Venus ' pigeons fly To seal love 's bonds new made than they are wo nt To keep obliged faith unforfeited That ever holds who riseth from a feast With that keen appetite that he sits down Where is the horse that doth untread again His tedious measures with the unbated fire That he did pace them first All things that are Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed How like a younker or a prodigal The scarfed bark puts from her native bay Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind How like the prodigal doth she return With over weather'd ribs and ragged sails Lean rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind Here comes Lorenzo more of this hereafter Sweet friends your patience for my long abode Not I but my affairs have made you wait When you shall please to play the thieves for wives I 'll watch as long for you then Approach Here dwells my father Jew Ho who 's within Who are you Tell me for more certainty Albeit I 'll swear that I do know your tongue Lorenzo and thy love Lorenzo certain and my love indeed For who love I so much And now who knows But you Lorenzo whether I am yours Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art Here catch this casket it is worth the pains I am glad ' tis night you do not look on me For I am much asham'd of my exchange But love is blind and lovers can not see The pretty follies that themselves commit For if they could Cupid himself would blush To see me thus transformed to a boy Descend for you must be my torch bearer What must I hold a candle to my shames They in themselves good sooth are too too light Why ' tis an office of discovery love And I should be obscur'd So are you sweet Even in the lovely garnish of a boy But come at once For the close night doth play the runaway And we are stay'd for at Bassanio 's feast I will make fast the doors and gild myself With some moe ducats and be with you straight Now by my hood a gentle and no Jew Beshrew me but I love her heartily For she is wise if I can judge of her And fair she is if that mine eyes be true And true she is as she hath prov'd herself And therefore like herself wise fair and true Shall she be placed in my constant soul Who 's there Signior Antonio Fie fie Gratiano where are all the rest ' Tis nine o'clock our friends all stay for you No masque to night the wind is come about Bassanio presently will go aboard I have sent twenty out to seek for you I am glad on't I desire no more delight Than to be under sail and gone to night Exeunt Go draw aside the curtains and discover The several caskets to this noble Prince Now make your choice The first of gold who this inscription bears ' Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ' The second silver which this promise carries ' Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ' This third dull lead with warning all as blunt ' Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath ' How shall I know if I do choose the right The one of them contains my picture Prince If you choose that then I am yours withal Some god direct my judgment Let me see I will survey th ' inscriptions back again What says this leaden casket ' Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath ' Must give- for what For lead Hazard for lead This casket threatens men that hazard all Do it in hope of fair advantages A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross I 'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead What says the silver with her virgin hue ' Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ' As much as he deserves Pause there Morocco And weigh thy value with an even hand If thou beest rated by thy estimation Thou dost deserve enough and yet enough May not extend so far as to the lady And yet to be afeard of my deserving Were but a weak disabling of myself As much as I deserve Why that 's the lady I do in birth deserve her and in fortunes In graces and in qualities of breeding But more than these in love I do deserve What if I stray'd no farther but chose here Let 's see once more this saying grav'd in gold ' Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ' Why that 's the lady All the world desires her From the four corners of the earth they come To kiss this shrine this mortal breathing saint The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now For princes to come view fair Portia The watery kingdom whose ambitious head Spits in the face of heaven is no bar To stop the foreign spirits but they come As o'er a brook to see fair Portia One of these three contains her heavenly picture Is't like that lead contains her ' Twere damnation To think so base a thought it were too gross To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave Or shall I think in silver she 's immur'd Being ten times undervalued to tried gold O sinful thought Never so rich a gem Was set in worse than gold They have in England A coin that bears the figure of an angel Stamp'd in gold but that 's insculp'd upon But here an angel in a golden bed Lies all within Deliver me the key Here do I choose and thrive I as I may There take it Prince and if my form lie there Then I am yours He opens the golden casket O hell what have we here A carrion Death within whose empty eye There is a written scroll I 'll read the writing A gentle riddance Draw the curtains go Let all of his complexion choose me so Exeunt Why man I saw Bassanio under sail With him is Gratiano gone along And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not The villain Jew with outcries rais'd the Duke Who went with him to search Bassanio 's ship He came too late the ship was under sail But there the Duke was given to understand That in a gondola were seen together Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica Besides Antonio certified the Duke They were not with Bassanio in his ship I never heard a passion so confus'd So strange outrageous and so variable As the dog Jew did utter in the streets ' My daughter O my ducats O my daughter Fled with a Christian O my Christian ducats Justice the law My ducats and my daughter A sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats Of double ducats stol'n from me by my daughter And jewels- two stones two rich and precious stones Stol'n by my daughter Justice Find the girl She hath the stones upon her and the ducats ' Why all the boys in Venice follow him Crying his stones his daughter and his ducats Let good Antonio look he keep his day Or he shall pay for this Marry well rememb'red I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday Who told me in the narrow seas that part The French and English there miscarried A vessel of our country richly fraught I thought upon Antonio when he told me And wish'd in silence that it were not his You were best to tell Antonio what you hear Yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him A kinder gentleman treads not the earth I saw Bassanio and Antonio part Bassanio told him he would make some speed Of his return He answered ' Do not so Slubber not business for my sake Bassanio But stay the very riping of the time And for the Jew 's bond which he hath of me Let it not enter in your mind of love Be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts To courtship and such fair ostents of love As shall conveniently become you there ' And even there his eye being big with tears Turning his face he put his hand behind him And with affection wondrous sensible He wrung Bassanio 's hand and so they parted I think he only loves the world for him I pray thee let us go and find him out And quicken his embraced heaviness With some delight or other Do we so Exeunt Quick quick I pray thee draw the curtain straight The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath And comes to his election presently Behold there stand the caskets noble Prince If you choose that wherein I am contain'd Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz'd But if you fail without more speech my lord You must be gone from hence immediately I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things First never to unfold to any one Which casket ' twas I chose next if I fail Of the right casket never in my life To woo a maid in way of marriage Lastly If I do fail in fortune of my choice Immediately to leave you and be gone To these injunctions every one doth swear That comes to hazard for my worthless self And so have I address'd me Fortune now To my heart 's hope Gold silver and base lead ' Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath ' You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard What says the golden chest Ha let me see ' Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire ' What many men desire- that ' many ' may be meant By the fool multitude that choose by show Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach Which pries not to th ' interior but like the martlet Builds in the weather on the outward wall Even in the force and road of casualty I will not choose what many men desire Because I will not jump with common spirits And rank me with the barbarous multitudes Why then to thee thou silver treasure house Tell me once more what title thou dost bear ' Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ' And well said too for who shall go about To cozen fortune and be honourable Without the stamp of merit Let none presume To wear an undeserved dignity O that estates degrees and offices Were not deriv'd corruptly and that clear honour Were purchas'd by the merit of the wearer How many then should cover that stand bare How many be commanded that command How much low peasantry would then be gleaned From the true seed of honour and how much honour Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times To be new varnish'd Well but to my choice ' Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves ' I will assume desert Give me a key for this And instantly unlock my fortunes here Aside Too long a pause for that which you find there What 's here The portrait of a blinking idiot Presenting me a schedule I will read it How much unlike art thou to Portia How much unlike my hopes and my deservings ' Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves ' Did I deserve no more than a fool 's head Is that my prize Are my deserts no better To offend and judge are distinct offices And of opposed natures What is here Reads Thus hath the candle sing'd the moth O these deliberate fools When they do choose They have the wisdom by their wit to lose The ancient saying is no heresy Hanging and wiving goes by destiny Come draw the curtain Nerissa Where is my lady Here what would my lord Madam there is alighted at your gate A young Venetian one that comes before To signify th ' approaching of his lord From whom he bringeth sensible regreets To wit besides commends and courteous breath Gifts of rich value Yet I have not seen So likely an ambassador of love A day in April never came so sweet To show how costly summer was at hand As this fore spurrer comes before his lord No more I pray thee I am half afeard Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee Thou spend'st such high day wit in praising him Come come Nerissa for I long to see Quick Cupid 's post that comes so mannerly Bassanio Lord Love if thy will it be Exeunt Now what news on the Rialto Why yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath a ship of rich lading wreck'd on the narrow seas the Goodwins I think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcases of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip Report be an honest woman of her word I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapp'd ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband But it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good Antonio the honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enough to keep his name company!- Come the full stop Ha What sayest thou Why the end is he hath lost a ship I would it might prove the end of his losses Let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew You knew none so well none so well as you of my daughter 's flight That 's certain I for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal And Shylock for his own part knew the bird was flidge and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam She is damn'd for it That 's certain if the devil may be her judge My own flesh and blood to rebel Out upon it old carrion Rebels it at these years I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood There is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and Rhenish But tell us do you hear whether Antonio have had any loss at sea or no There I have another bad match a bankrupt a prodigal who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto a beggar that was us'd to come so smug upon the mart Let him look to his bond He was wo nt to call me usurer let him look to his bond He was wo nt to lend money for a Christian courtesy let him look to his bond Why I am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh What 's that good for To bait fish withal If it will feed nothing else it will feed my revenge He hath disgrac'd me and hind'red me half a million laugh'd at my losses mock'd at my gains scorned my nation thwarted my bargains cooled my friends heated mine enemies And what 's his reason I am a Jew Hath not a Jew eyes Hath not a Jew hands organs dimensions senses affections passions fed with the same food hurt with the same weapons subject to the same diseases healed by the same means warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is If you prick us do we not bleed If you tickle us do we not laugh If you poison us do we not die And if you wrong us shall we not revenge If we are like you in the rest we will resemble you in that If a Jew wrong a Christian what is his humility Revenge If a Christian wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by Christian example Why revenge The villainy you teach me I will execute and itshall go hard but I will better the instruction Gentlemen my master Antonio is at his house and desires to speak with you both We have been up and down to seek him Here comes another of the tribe a third can not be match'd unless the devil himself turn Jew How now Tubal what news from Genoa Hast thou found my daughter I often came where I did hear of her but can not find her Why there there there there A diamond gone cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort The curse never fell upon our nation till now I never felt it till now Two thousand ducats in that and other precious precious jewels I would my daughter were dead at my foot and the jewels in her ear would she were hears'd at my foot and the ducats in her coffin No news of them Why so- and I know not what 's spent in the search Why thou- loss upon loss The thief gone with so much and so much to find the thief and no satisfaction no revenge nor no ill luck stirring but what lights o ' my shoulders no sighs but o ' my breathing no tears but o ' my shedding Yes other men have ill luck too Antonio as I heard in Genoa- What what what Ill luck ill luck Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis I thank God I thank God Is it true is it true I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck I thank thee good Tubal Good news good news- ha ha!- heard in Genoa Your daughter spent in Genoa as I heard one night fourscore ducats Thou stick'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my gold again Fourscore ducats at a sitting Fourscore ducats There came divers of Antonio 's creditors in my company to Venice that swear he can not choose but break I am very glad of it I 'll plague him I 'll torture him I am glad of it One of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey Out upon her Thou torturest me Tubal It was my turquoise I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys But Antonio is certainly undone Nay that 's true that 's very true Go Tubal fee me an officer bespeak him a fortnight before I will have the heart of him if he forfeit for were he out of Venice I can make what merchandise I will Go Tubal and meet me at our synagogue go good Tubal at our synagogue Tubal Exeunt I pray you tarry pause a day or two Before you hazard for in choosing wrong I lose your company therefore forbear a while There 's something tells me- but it is not love- I would not lose you and you know yourself Hate counsels not in such a quality But lest you should not understand me well- And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought- I would detain you here some month or two Before you venture for me I could teach you How to choose right but then I am forsworn So will I never be so may you miss me But if you do you 'll make me wish a sin That I had been forsworn Beshrew your eyes They have o'erlook'd me and divided me One half of me is yours the other half yours- Mine own I would say but if mine then yours And so all yours O these naughty times Puts bars between the owners and their rights And so though yours not yours Prove it so Let fortune go to hell for it not I. I speak too long but ' tis to peize the time To eke it and to draw it out in length To stay you from election Let me choose For as I am I live upon the rack Upon the rack Bassanio Then confess What treason there is mingled with your love None but that ugly treason of mistrust Which makes me fear th ' enjoying of my love There may as well be amity and life ' Tween snow and fire as treason and my love Ay but I fear you speak upon the rack Where men enforced do speak anything Promise me life and I 'll confess the truth Well then confess and live ' Confess ' and ' love ' Had been the very sum of my confession O happy torment when my torturer Doth teach me answers for deliverance But let me to my fortune and the caskets Away then I am lock'd in one of them If you do love me you will find me out Nerissa and the rest stand all aloof Let music sound while he doth make his choice Then if he lose he makes a swan like end Fading in music That the comparison May stand more proper my eye shall be the stream And wat'ry death bed for him He may win And what is music then Then music is Even as the flourish when true subjects bow To a new crowned monarch such it is As are those dulcet sounds in break of day That creep into the dreaming bridegroom 's ear And summon him to marriage Now he goes With no less presence but with much more love Than young Alcides when he did redeem The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy To the sea monster I stand for sacrifice The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives With bleared visages come forth to view The issue of th ' exploit Go Hercules Live thou I live With much much more dismay I view the fight than thou that mak'st the fray Ding dong bell So may the outward shows be least themselves The world is still deceiv'd with ornament In law what plea so tainted and corrupt But being season'd with a gracious voice Obscures the show of evil In religion What damned error but some sober brow Will bless it and approve it with a text Hiding the grossness with fair ornament There is no vice so simple but assumes Some mark of virtue on his outward parts How many cowards whose hearts are all as false As stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars Who inward search'd have livers white as milk And these assume but valour 's excrement To render them redoubted Look on beauty And you shall see ' tis purchas'd by the weight Which therein works a miracle in nature Making them lightest that wear most of it So are those crisped snaky golden locks Which make such wanton gambols with the wind Upon supposed fairness often known To be the dowry of a second head- The skull that bred them in the sepulchre Thus ornament is but the guiled shore To a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf Veiling an Indian beauty in a word The seeming truth which cunning times put on To entrap the wisest Therefore thou gaudy gold Hard food for Midas I will none of thee Nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge ' Tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead Which rather threaten'st than dost promise aught Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence And here choose I. Joy be the consequence Aside How all the other passions fleet to air As doubtful thoughts and rash embrac'd despair And shudd'ring fear and green ey'd jealousy O love be moderate allay thy ecstasy In measure rain thy joy scant this excess I feel too much thy blessing Make it less For fear I surfeit Opening the leaden casket What find I here Fair Portia 's counterfeit What demi god Hath come so near creation Move these eyes Or whether riding on the balls of mine Seem they in motion Here are sever'd lips Parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar Should sunder such sweet friends Here in her hairs The painter plays the spider and hath woven A golden mesh t ' entrap the hearts of men Faster than gnats in cobwebs But her eyes- How could he see to do them Having made one Methinks it should have power to steal both his And leave itself unfurnish'd Yet look how far The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow In underprizing it so far this shadow Doth limp behind the substance Here 's the scroll The continent and summary of my fortune You see me Lord Bassanio where I stand Such as I am Though for myself alone I would not be ambitious in my wish To wish myself much better yet for you I would be trebled twenty times myself A thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich That only to stand high in your account I might in virtues beauties livings friends Exceed account But the full sum of me Is sum of something which to term in gross Is an unlesson'd girl unschool'd unpractis'd Happy in this she is not yet so old But she may learn happier than this She is not bred so dull but she can learn Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit Commits itself to yours to be directed As from her lord her governor her king Myself and what is mine to you and yours Is now converted But now I was the lord Of this fair mansion master of my servants Queen o'er myself and even now but now This house these servants and this same myself Are yours- my lord 's I give them with this ring Which when you part from lose or give away Let it presage the ruin of your love And be my vantage to exclaim on you Madam you have bereft me of all words Only my blood speaks to you in my veins And there is such confusion in my powers As after some oration fairly spoke By a beloved prince there doth appear Among the buzzing pleased multitude Where every something being blent together Turns to a wild of nothing save of joy Express'd and not express'd But when this ring Parts from this finger then parts life from hence O then be bold to say Bassanio 's dead My lord and lady it is now our time That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper To cry ' Good joy ' Good joy my lord and lady My Lord Bassanio and my gentle lady I wish you all the joy that you can wish For I am sure you can wish none from me And when your honours mean to solemnize The bargain of your faith I do beseech you Even at that time I may be married too With all my heart so thou canst get a wife I thank your lordship you have got me one My eyes my lord can look as swift as yours You saw the mistress I beheld the maid You lov'd I lov'd for intermission No more pertains to me my lord than you Your fortune stood upon the caskets there And so did mine too as the matter falls For wooing here until I sweat again And swearing till my very roof was dry With oaths of love at last- if promise last- I got a promise of this fair one here To have her love provided that your fortune Achiev'd her mistress Is this true Nerissa Madam it is so you stand pleas'd withal And do you Gratiano mean good faith Yes faith my lord Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage We 'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats What and stake down No we shall ne'er win at that sport and stake down- But who comes here Lorenzo and his infidel What and my old Venetian friend Salerio Lorenzo and Salerio welcome hither If that the youth of my new int'rest here Have power to bid you welcome By your leave I bid my very friends and countrymen Sweet Portia welcome So do I my lord They are entirely welcome I thank your honour For my part my lord My purpose was not to have seen you here But meeting with Salerio by the way He did entreat me past all saying nay To come with him along I did my lord And I have reason for it Signior Antonio Commends him to you Gives BASSANIO a letter Ere I ope his letter I pray you tell me how my good friend doth Not sick my lord unless it be in mind Nor well unless in mind his letter there Will show you his estate BASSANIO opens the letter Nerissa cheer yond stranger bid her welcome Your hand Salerio What 's the news from Venice How doth that royal merchant good Antonio I know he will be glad of our success We are the Jasons we have won the fleece I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper That steals the colour from Bassanio 's cheek Some dear friend dead else nothing in the world Could turn so much the constitution Of any constant man What worse and worse With leave Bassanio I am half yourself And I must freely have the half of anything That this same paper brings you O sweet Portia Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words That ever blotted paper Gentle lady When I did first impart my love to you I freely told you all the wealth I had Ran in my veins- I was a gentleman And then I told you true And yet dear lady Rating myself at nothing you shall see How much I was a braggart When I told you My state was nothing I should then have told you That I was worse than nothing for indeed I have engag'd myself to a dear friend Engag'd my friend to his mere enemy To feed my means Here is a letter lady The paper as the body of my friend And every word in it a gaping wound Issuing life blood But is it true Salerio Hath all his ventures fail'd What not one hit From Tripolis from Mexico and England From Lisbon Barbary and India And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch Of merchant marring rocks Not one my lord Besides it should appear that if he had The present money to discharge the Jew He would not take it Never did I know A creature that did bear the shape of man So keen and greedy to confound a man He plies the Duke at morning and at night And doth impeach the freedom of the state If they deny him justice Twenty merchants The Duke himself and the magnificoes Of greatest port have all persuaded with him But none can drive him from the envious plea Of forfeiture of justice and his bond When I was with him I have heard him swear To Tubal and to Chus his countrymen That he would rather have Antonio 's flesh Than twenty times the value of the sum That he did owe him and I know my lord If law authority and power deny not It will go hard with poor Antonio Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble The dearest friend to me the kindest man The best condition'd and unwearied spirit In doing courtesies and one in whom The ancient Roman honour more appears Than any that draws breath in Italy What sum owes he the Jew For me three thousand ducats What no more Pay him six thousand and deface the bond Double six thousand and then treble that Before a friend of this description Shall lose a hair through Bassanio 's fault First go with me to church and call me wife And then away to Venice to your friend For never shall you lie by Portia 's side With an unquiet soul You shall have gold To pay the petty debt twenty times over When it is paid bring your true friend along My maid Nerissa and myself meantime Will live as maids and widows Come away For you shall hence upon your wedding day Bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer Since you are dear bought I will love you dear But let me hear the letter of your friend Reads ' Sweet Bassanio my ships have all miscarried my creditors grow cruel my estate is very low my bond to the Jew is forfeit and since in paying it it is impossible I should live all debts are clear'd between you and I if I might but see you at my death Notwithstanding use your pleasure if your love do not persuade you to come let not my letter ' O love dispatch all business and be gone Since I have your good leave to go away I will make haste but till I come again No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay Nor rest be interposer ' twixt us twain Exeunt Gaoler look to him Tell not me of mercy- This is the fool that lent out money gratis Gaoler look to him Hear me yet good Shylock I 'll have my bond speak not against my bond I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause But since I am a dog beware my fangs The Duke shall grant me justice I do wonder Thou naughty gaoler that thou art so fond To come abroad with him at his request I pray thee hear me speak I 'll have my bond I will not hear thee speak I 'll have my bond and therefore speak no more I 'll not be made a soft and dull ey'd fool To shake the head relent and sigh and yield To Christian intercessors Follow not I 'll have no speaking I will have my bond Exit It is the most impenetrable cur That ever kept with men Let him alone I 'll follow him no more with bootless prayers He seeks my life his reason well I know I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures Many that have at times made moan to me Therefore he hates me I am sure the Duke Will never grant this forfeiture to hold The Duke can not deny the course of law For the commodity that strangers have With us in Venice if it be denied Will much impeach the justice of the state Since that the trade and profit of the city Consisteth of all nations Therefore go These griefs and losses have so bated me That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh To morrow to my bloody creditor Well gaoler on pray God Bassanio come To see me pay his debt and then I care not Exeunt Madam although I speak it in your presence You have a noble and a true conceit Of godlike amity which appears most strongly In bearing thus the absence of your lord But if you knew to whom you show this honour How true a gentleman you send relief How dear a lover of my lord your husband I know you would be prouder of the work Than customary bounty can enforce you I never did repent for doing good Nor shall not now for in companions That do converse and waste the time together Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love There must be needs a like proportion Of lineaments of manners and of spirit Which makes me think that this Antonio Being the bosom lover of my lord Must needs be like my lord If it be so How little is the cost I have bestowed In purchasing the semblance of my soul From out the state of hellish cruelty This comes too near the praising of myself Therefore no more of it hear other things Lorenzo I commit into your hands The husbandry and manage of my house Until my lord 's return for mine own part I have toward heaven breath'd a secret vow To live in prayer and contemplation Only attended by Nerissa here Until her husband and my lord 's return There is a monastery two miles off And there we will abide I do desire you Not to deny this imposition The which my love and some necessity Now lays upon you Madam with all my heart I shall obey you in an fair commands My people do already know my mind And will acknowledge you and Jessica In place of Lord Bassanio and myself So fare you well till we shall meet again Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you I wish your ladyship all heart 's content I thank you for your wish and am well pleas'd To wish it back on you Fare you well Jessica Madam I go with all convenient speed Exit Come on Nerissa I have work in hand That you yet know not of we 'll see our husbands Before they think of us Shall they see us They shall Nerissa but in such a habit That they shall think we are accomplished With that we lack I 'll hold thee any wager When we are both accoutred like young men I 'll prove the prettier fellow of the two And wear my dagger with the braver grace And speak between the change of man and boy With a reed voice and turn two mincing steps Into a manly stride and speak of frays Like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies How honourable ladies sought my love Which I denying they fell sick and died- I could not do withal Then I 'll repent And wish for all that that I had not kill'd them And twenty of these puny lies I 'll tell That men shall swear I have discontinued school About a twelvemonth I have within my mind A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks Which I will practise Why shall we turn to men Fie what a question 's that If thou wert near a lewd interpreter But come I 'll tell thee all my whole device When I am in my coach which stays for us At the park gate and therefore haste away For we must measure twenty miles to day Exeunt Yes truly for look you the sins of the father are to be laid upon the children therefore I promise you I fear you I was always plain with you and so now I speak my agitation of the matter therefore be o ' good cheer for truly I think you are damn'd There is but one hope in it that can do you any good and that is but a kind of bastard hope neither And what hope is that I pray thee Marry you may partly hope that your father got you not- That were a kind of bastard hope indeed so the sins of my mother should be visited upon me Truly then I fear you are damn'd both by father and mother thus when I shun Scylla your father I fall into Charybdis your mother well you are gone both ways I shall be sav'd by my husband he hath made me a Christian Truly the more to blame he we were Christians enow before e'en as many as could well live one by another This making of Christians will raise the price of hogs if we grow all to be pork eaters we shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money I 'll tell my husband Launcelot what you say here he comes I shall grow jealous of you shortly Launcelot if you thus get my wife into corners Nay you need nor fear us Lorenzo Launcelot and I are out he tells me flatly there 's no mercy for me in heaven because I am a Jew 's daughter and he says you are no good member of the commonwealth for in converting Jews to Christians you raise the price of pork I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than you can the getting up of the negro 's belly the Moor is with child by you Launcelot It is much that the Moor should be more than reason but if she be less than an honest woman she is indeed more than I took her for How every fool can play upon the word I think the best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence and discourse grow commendable in none only but parrots Go in sirrah bid them prepare for dinner That is done sir they have all stomachs Goodly Lord what a wit snapper are you Then bid them prepare dinner That is done too sir only ' cover ' is the word Will you cover then sir Not so sir neither I know my duty Yet more quarrelling with occasion Wilt thou show the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant I pray thee understand a plain man in his plain meaning go to thy fellows bid them cover the table serve in the meat and we will come in to dinner For the table sir it shall be serv'd in for the meat sir it shall be cover'd for your coming in to dinner sir why let it be as humours and conceits shall govern O dear discretion how his words are suited The fool hath planted in his memory An army of good words and I do know A many fools that stand in better place Garnish'd like him that for a tricksy word Defy the matter How cheer'st thou Jessica And now good sweet say thy opinion How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio 's wife Past all expressing It is very meet The Lord Bassanio live an upright life For having such a blessing in his lady He finds the joys of heaven here on earth And if on earth he do not merit it In reason he should never come to heaven Why if two gods should play some heavenly match And on the wager lay two earthly women And Portia one there must be something else Pawn'd with the other for the poor rude world Hath not her fellow Even such a husband Hast thou of me as she is for a wife Nay but ask my opinion too of that I will anon first let us go to dinner Nay let me praise you while I have a stomach No pray thee let it serve for table talk Then howsome'er thou speak'st ' mong other things I shall digest it Well I 'll set you forth Exeunt What is Antonio here Ready so please your Grace I am sorry for thee thou art come to answer A stony adversary an inhuman wretch Uncapable of pity void and empty From any dram of mercy I have heard Your Grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify His rigorous course but since he stands obdurate And that no lawful means can carry me Out of his envy 's reach I do oppose My patience to his fury and am arm'd To suffer with a quietness of spirit The very tyranny and rage of his Go one and call the Jew into the court He is ready at the door he comes my lord Make room and let him stand before our face Shylock the world thinks and I think so too That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice To the last hour of act and then ' tis thought Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange Than is thy strange apparent cruelty And where thou now exacts the penalty Which is a pound of this poor merchant 's flesh Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture But touch'd with human gentleness and love Forgive a moiety of the principal Glancing an eye of pity on his losses That have of late so huddled on his back- Enow to press a royal merchant down And pluck commiseration of his state From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint From stubborn Turks and Tartars never train'd To offices of tender courtesy We all expect a gentle answer Jew I have possess'd your Grace of what I purpose And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn To have the due and forfeit of my bond If you deny it let the danger light Upon your charter and your city 's freedom You 'll ask me why I rather choose to have A weight of carrion flesh than to receive Three thousand ducats I 'll not answer that But say it is my humour- is it answer'd What if my house be troubled with a rat And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats To have it ban'd What are you answer'd yet Some men there are love not a gaping pig Some that are mad if they behold a cat And others when the bagpipe sings i ' th ' nose Can not contain their urine for affection Mistress of passion sways it to the mood Of what it likes or loathes Now for your answer As there is no firm reason to be rend'red Why he can not abide a gaping pig Why he a harmless necessary cat Why he a woollen bagpipe but of force Must yield to such inevitable shame As to offend himself being offended So can I give no reason nor I will not More than a lodg'd hate and a certain loathing I bear Antonio that I follow thus A losing suit against him Are you answered This is no answer thou unfeeling man To excuse the current of thy cruelty I am not bound to please thee with my answers Do all men kill the things they do not love Hates any man the thing he would not kill Every offence is not a hate at first What wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice I pray you think you question with the Jew You may as well go stand upon the beach And bid the main flood bate his usual height You may as well use question with the wolf Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb You may as well forbid the mountain pines To wag their high tops and to make no noise When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven You may as well do anything most hard As seek to soften that- than which what 's harder?- His jewish heart Therefore I do beseech you Make no moe offers use no farther means But with all brief and plain conveniency Let me have judgment and the Jew his will For thy three thousand ducats here is six If every ducat in six thousand ducats Were in six parts and every part a ducat I would not draw them I would have my bond How shalt thou hope for mercy rend'ring none What judgment shall I dread doing no wrong You have among you many a purchas'd slave Which fike your asses and your dogs and mules You use in abject and in slavish parts Because you bought them shall I say to you ' Let them be free marry them to your heirs- Why sweat they under burdens?- let their beds Be made as soft as yours and let their palates Be season'd with such viands ' You will answer ' The slaves are ours ' So do I answer you The pound of flesh which I demand of him Is dearly bought ' tis mine and I will have it If you deny me fie upon your law There is no force in the decrees of Venice I stand for judgment answer shall I have it Upon my power I may dismiss this court Unless Bellario a learned doctor Whom I have sent for to determine this Come here to day My lord here stays without A messenger with letters from the doctor New come from Padua Bring us the letters call the messenger Good cheer Antonio What man courage yet The Jew shall have my flesh blood bones and all Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood I am a tainted wether of the flock Meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit Drops earliest to the ground and so let me You can not better be employ'd Bassanio Than to live still and write mine epitaph Came you from Padua from Bellario From both my lord Bellario greets your Grace Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there Not on thy sole but on thy soul harsh Jew Thou mak'st thy knife keen but no metal can No not the hangman 's axe bear half the keenness Of thy sharp envy Can no prayers pierce thee No none that thou hast wit enough to make O be thou damn'd inexecrable dog And for thy life let justice be accus'd Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith To hold opinion with Pythagoras That souls of animals infuse themselves Into the trunks of men Thy currish spirit Govern'd a wolf who hang'd for human slaughter Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet And whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam Infus'd itself in thee for thy desires Are wolfish bloody starv'd and ravenous Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud Repair thy wit good youth or it will fall To cureless ruin I stand here for law This letter from Bellario doth commend A young and learned doctor to our court Where is he He attendeth here hard by To know your answer whether you 'll admit him With all my heart Some three or four of you Go give him courteous conduct to this place Meantime the court shall hear Bellario 's letter Reads ' Your Grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome- his name is Balthazar I acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant we turn'd o'er many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof I can not enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to fill up your Grace 's request in my stead I beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for I never knew so young a body with so old a head I leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendation ' YOU hear the learn'd Bellario what he writes And here I take it is the doctor come Give me your hand come you from old Bellario I did my lord You are welcome take your place Are you acquainted with the difference That holds this present question in the court I am informed throughly of the cause Which is the merchant here and which the Jew Antonio and old Shylock both stand forth Is your name Shylock Shylock is my name Of a strange nature is the suit you follow Yet in such rule that the Venetian law Can not impugn you as you do proceed You stand within his danger do you not Ay so he says Do you confess the bond I do Then must the Jew be merciful On what compulsion must I Tell me that The quality of mercy is not strain'd It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath It is twice blest It blesseth him that gives and him that takes ' Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes The throned monarch better than his crown His sceptre shows the force of temporal power The attribute to awe and majesty Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings But mercy is above this sceptred sway It is enthroned in the hearts of kings It is an attribute to God himself And earthly power doth then show likest God 's When mercy seasons justice Therefore Jew Though justice be thy plea consider this- That in the course of justice none of us Should see salvation we do pray for mercy And that same prayer doth teach us all to render The deeds of mercy I have spoke thus much To mitigate the justice of thy plea Which if thou follow this strict court of Venice Must needs give sentence ' gainst the merchant there My deeds upon my head I crave the law The penalty and forfeit of my bond Yes here I tender it for him in the court Yea twice the sum if that will not suffice I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er On forfeit of my hands my head my heart If this will not suffice it must appear That malice bears down truth And I beseech you Wrest once the law to your authority To do a great right do a little wrong And curb this cruel devil of his will It must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established ' Twill be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the state it can not be A Daniel come to judgment Yea a Daniel O wise young judge how I do honour thee I pray you let me look upon the bond Here ' tis most reverend Doctor here it is Shylock there 's thrice thy money off'red thee An oath an oath I have an oath in heaven Shall I lay perjury upon my soul No not for Venice Why this bond is forfeit And lawfully by this the Jew may claim A pound of flesh to be by him cut off Nearest the merchant 's heart Be merciful Take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond When it is paid according to the tenour It doth appear you are a worthy judge You know the law your exposition Hath been most sound I charge you by the law Whereof you are a well deserving pillar Proceed to judgment By my soul I swear There is no power in the tongue of man To alter me I stay here on my bond Most heartily I do beseech the court To give the judgment Why then thus it is You must prepare your bosom for his knife O noble judge O excellent young man For the intent and purpose of the law Hath full relation to the penalty Which here appeareth due upon the bond ' Tis very true O wise and upright judge How much more elder art thou than thy looks Therefore lay bare your bosom Ay his breast- So says the bond doth it not noble judge ' Nearest his heart ' those are the very words It is so Are there balance here to weigh The flesh I have them ready Have by some surgeon Shylock on your charge To stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death Is it so nominated in the bond It is not so express'd but what of that ' Twere good you do so much for charity I can not find it ' tis not in the bond You merchant have you anything to say But little I am arm'd and well prepar'd Give me your hand Bassanio fare you well Grieve not that I am fall'n to this for you For herein Fortune shows herself more kind Than is her custom It is still her use To let the wretched man outlive his wealth To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow An age of poverty from which ling'ring penance Of such misery doth she cut me off Commend me to your honourable wife Tell her the process of Antonio 's end Say how I lov'd you speak me fair in death And when the tale is told bid her be judge Whether Bassanio had not once a love Repent but you that you shall lose your friend And he repents not that he pays your debt For if the Jew do cut but deep enough I 'll pay it instantly with all my heart Antonio I am married to a wife Which is as dear to me as life itself But life itself my wife and all the world Are not with me esteem'd above thy life I would lose all ay sacrifice them all Here to this devil to deliver you Your wife would give you little thanks for that If she were by to hear you make the offer I have a wife who I protest I love I would she were in heaven so she could Entreat some power to change this currish Jew ' Tis well you offer it behind her back The wish would make else an unquiet house Aside These be the Christian husbands I have a daughter- Would any of the stock of Barrabas Had been her husband rather than a Christian!- We trifle time I pray thee pursue sentence A pound of that same merchant 's flesh is thine The court awards it and the law doth give it Most rightful judge And you must cut this flesh from off his breast The law allows it and the court awards it Most learned judge A sentence Come prepare Tarry a little there is something else This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood The words expressly are ' a pound of flesh ' Take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh But in the cutting it if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood thy lands and goods Are by the laws of Venice confiscate Unto the state of Venice O upright judge Mark Jew O learned judge Is that the law Thyself shalt see the act For as thou urgest justice be assur'd Thou shalt have justice more than thou desir'st O learned judge Mark Jew A learned judge I take this offer then pay the bond thrice And let the Christian go Here is the money Soft The Jew shall have all justice Soft No haste He shall have nothing but the penalty O Jew an upright judge a learned judge Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh Shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more But just a pound of flesh if thou tak'st more Or less than a just pound- be it but so much As makes it light or heavy in the substance Or the division of the twentieth part Of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn But in the estimation of a hair- Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate A second Daniel a Daniel Jew Now infidel I have you on the hip Why doth the Jew pause Take thy forfeiture Give me my principal and let me go I have it ready for thee here it is He hath refus'd it in the open court He shall have merely justice and his bond A Daniel still say I a second Daniel I thank thee Jew for teaching me that word Shall I not have barely my principal Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture To be so taken at thy peril Jew Why then the devil give him good of it I 'll stay no longer question Tarry Jew The law hath yet another hold on you It is enacted in the laws of Venice If it be proved against an alien That by direct or indirect attempts He seek the life of any citizen The party ' gainst the which he doth contrive Shall seize one half his goods the other half Comes to the privy coffer of the state And the offender 's life lies in the mercy Of the Duke only ' gainst all other voice In which predicament I say thou stand'st For it appears by manifest proceeding That indirectly and directly too Thou hast contrived against the very life Of the defendant and thou hast incurr'd The danger formerly by me rehears'd Down therefore and beg mercy of the Duke Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself And yet thy wealth being forfeit to the state Thou hast not left the value of a cord Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state 's charge That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it For half thy wealth it is Antonio 's The other half comes to the general state Which humbleness may drive unto a fine Ay for the state not for Antonio Nay take my life and all pardon not that You take my house when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live What mercy can you render him Antonio A halter gratis nothing else for God 's sake So please my lord the Duke and all the court To quit the fine for one half of his goods I am content so he will let me have The other half in use to render it Upon his death unto the gentleman That lately stole his daughter- Two things provided more that for this favour He presently become a Christian The other that he do record a gift Here in the court of all he dies possess'd Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter He shall do this or else I do recant The pardon that I late pronounced here Art thou contented Jew What dost thou say I am content Clerk draw a deed of gift I pray you give me leave to go from hence I am not well send the deed after me And I will sign it Get thee gone but do it In christ'ning shalt thou have two god fathers Had I been judge thou shouldst have had ten more To bring thee to the gallows not to the font Sir I entreat you home with me to dinner I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon I must away this night toward Padua And it is meet I presently set forth I am sorry that your leisure serves you not Antonio gratify this gentleman For in my mind you are much bound to him Most worthy gentleman I and my friend Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted Of grievous penalties in lieu whereof Three thousand ducats due unto the Jew We freely cope your courteous pains withal And stand indebted over and above In love and service to you evermore He is well paid that is well satisfied And I delivering you am satisfied And therein do account myself well paid My mind was never yet more mercenary I pray you know me when we meet again I wish you well and so I take my leave Dear sir of force I must attempt you further Take some remembrance of us as a tribute Not as fee Grant me two things I pray you Not to deny me and to pardon me You press me far and therefore I will yield To ANTONIO Give me your gloves I 'll wear them for your sake To BASSANIO And for your love I 'll take this ring from you Do not draw back your hand I 'll take no more And you in love shall not deny me this This ring good sir- alas it is a trifle I will not shame myself to give you this I will have nothing else but only this And now methinks I have a mind to it There 's more depends on this than on the value The dearest ring in Venice will I give you And find it out by proclamation Only for this I pray you pardon me I see sir you are liberal in offers You taught me first to beg and now methinks You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd Good sir this ring was given me by my wife And when she put it on she made me vow That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it That ' scuse serves many men to save their gifts And if your wife be not a mad woman And know how well I have deserv'd this ring She would not hold out enemy for ever For giving it to me Well peace be with you My Lord Bassanio let him have the ring Let his deservings and my love withal Be valued ' gainst your wife 's commandment Go Gratiano run and overtake him Give him the ring and bring him if thou canst Unto Antonio 's house Away make haste Exit GRATIANO Come you and I will thither presently And in the morning early will we both Fly toward Belmont Come Antonio Exeunt Inquire the Jew 's house out give him this deed And let him sign it we 'll away tonight And be a day before our husbands home This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo Fair sir you are well o'erta'en My Lord Bassanio upon more advice Hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat Your company at dinner That can not be His ring I do accept most thankfully And so I pray you tell him Furthermore I pray you show my youth old Shylock 's house That will I do Sir I would speak with you Aside to PORTIA I 'll See if I can get my husband 's ring Which I did make him swear to keep for ever To NERISSA Thou Mayst I warrant We shall have old Come good sir will you show me to this house The moon shines bright In such a night as this When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees And they did make no noise- in such a night Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents Where Cressid lay that night In such a night Did Thisby fearfully o'ertrip the dew And saw the lion 's shadow ere himself And ran dismayed away In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love To come again to Carthage In such a night Medea gathered the enchanted herbs That did renew old AEson In such a night Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well Stealing her soul with many vows of faith And ne'er a true one In such a night Did pretty Jessica like a little shrew Slander her love and he forgave it her I would out night you did no body come But hark I hear the footing of a man Who comes so fast in silence of the night A friend A friend What friend Your name I pray you friend Stephano is my name and I bring word My mistress will before the break of day Be here at Belmont she doth stray about By holy crosses where she kneels and prays For happy wedlock hours Who comes with her None but a holy hermit and her maid I pray you is my master yet return'd He is not nor we have not heard from him But go we in I pray thee Jessica And ceremoniously let us prepare Some welcome for the mistress of the house Sola sola wo ha ho sola sola Who calls Sola Did you see Master Lorenzo Master Lorenzo Sola sola Leave holloaing man Here Sola Where where Here Tell him there 's a post come from my master with his horn full of good news my master will be here ere morning Sweet soul let 's in and there expect their coming And yet no matter- why should we go in My friend Stephano signify I pray you Within the house your mistress is at hand And bring your music forth into the air Exit STEPHANO How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank Here will we sit and let the sounds of music Creep in our ears soft stillness and the night Become the touches of sweet harmony Sit Jessica Look how the floor of heaven Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold There 's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st But in his motion like an angel sings Still quiring to the young ey'd cherubins Such harmony is in immortal souls But whilst this muddy vesture of decay Doth grossly close it in we can not hear it I am never merry when I hear sweet music The reason is your spirits are attentive For do but note a wild and wanton herd Or race of youthful and unhandled colts Fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud Which is the hot condition of their blood- If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound Or any air of music touch their ears You shall perceive them make a mutual stand Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze By the sweet power of music Therefore the poet Did feign that Orpheus drew trees stones and floods Since nought so stockish hard and full of rage But music for the time doth change his nature The man that hath no music in himself Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds Is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils The motions of his spirit are dull as night And his affections dark as Erebus Let no such man be trusted Mark the music That light we see is burning in my hall How far that little candle throws his beams So shines a good deed in a naughty world When the moon shone we did not see the candle So doth the greater glory dim the less A substitute shines brightly as a king Until a king be by and then his state Empties itself as doth an inland brook Into the main of waters Music hark It is your music madam of the house Nothing is good I see without respect Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day Silence bestows that virtue on it madam The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark When neither is attended and I think ne nightingale if she should sing by day When every goose is cackling would be thought No better a musician than the wren How many things by season season'd are To their right praise and true perfection Peace ho The moon sleeps with Endymion And would not be awak'd Music ceases That is the voice Or I am much deceiv'd of Portia He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo By the bad voice Dear lady welcome home We have been praying for our husbands ' welfare Which speed we hope the better for our words Are they return'd Madam they are not yet But there is come a messenger before To signify their coming Go in Nerissa Give order to my servants that they take No note at all of our being absent hence Nor you Lorenzo Jessica nor you A tucket sounds Your husband is at hand I hear his trumpet We are no tell tales madam fear you not This night methinks is but the daylight sick It looks a little paler ' tis a day Such as the day is when the sun is hid We should hold day with the Antipodes If you would walk in absence of the sun Let me give light but let me not be light For a light wife doth make a heavy husband And never be Bassanio so for me But God sort all You are welcome home my lord I thank you madam give welcome to my friend This is the man this is Antonio To whom I am so infinitely bound You should in all sense be much bound to him For as I hear he was much bound for you No more than I am well acquitted of Sir you are very welcome to our house It must appear in other ways than words Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy To NERISSA By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong In faith I gave it to the judge 's clerk Would he were gelt that had it for my part Since you do take it love so much at heart A quarrel ho already What 's the matter About a hoop of gold a paltry ring That she did give me whose posy was For all the world like cutler 's poetry Upon a knife ' Love me and leave me not ' What talk you of the posy or the value You swore to me when I did give it you That you would wear it till your hour of death And that it should lie with you in your grave Though not for me yet for your vehement oaths You should have been respective and have kept it Gave it a judge 's clerk No God 's my judge The clerk will ne'er wear hair on 's face that had it He will an if he live to be a man Ay if a woman live to be a man Now by this hand I gave it to a youth A kind of boy a little scrubbed boy No higher than thyself the judge 's clerk A prating boy that begg'd it as a fee I could not for my heart deny it him You were to blame I must be plain with you To part so slightly with your wife 's first gift A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger And so riveted with faith unto your flesh I gave my love a ring and made him swear Never to part with it and here he stands I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth That the world masters Now in faith Gratiano You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief An ' twere to me I should be mad at it Aside Why I were best to cut my left hand off And swear I lost the ring defending it My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed Deserv'd it too and then the boy his clerk That took some pains in writing he begg'd mine And neither man nor master would take aught But the two rings What ring gave you my lord Not that I hope which you receiv'd of me If I could add a lie unto a fault I would deny it but you see my finger Hath not the ring upon it it is gone Even so void is your false heart of truth By heaven I will ne'er come in your bed Until I see the ring Nor I in yours Till I again see mine Sweet Portia If you did know to whom I gave the ring If you did know for whom I gave the ring And would conceive for what I gave the ring And how unwillingly I left the ring When nought would be accepted but the ring You would abate the strength of your displeasure If you had known the virtue of the ring Or half her worthiness that gave the ring Or your own honour to contain the ring You would not then have parted with the ring What man is there so much unreasonable If you had pleas'd to have defended it With any terms of zeal wanted the modesty To urge the thing held as a ceremony Nerissa teaches me what to believe I 'll die for't but some woman had the ring No by my honour madam by my soul No woman had it but a civil doctor Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me And begg'd the ring the which I did deny him And suffer'd him to go displeas'd away- Even he that had held up the very life Of my dear friend What should I say sweet lady I was enforc'd to send it after him I was beset with shame and courtesy My honour would not let ingratitude So much besmear it Pardon me good lady For by these blessed candles of the night Had you been there I think you would have begg'd The ring of me to give the worthy doctor Let not that doctor e'er come near my house Since he hath got the jewel that I loved And that which you did swear to keep for me I will become as liberal as you I 'll not deny him anything I have No not my body nor my husband 's bed Know him I shall I am well sure of it Lie not a night from home watch me

have merited either in my mind or in my means meed I am sure I have received none unless experience be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite rate and that hath taught me to say this ' Love like

Sir John do you think though we would have thrust virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders and have given ourselves without scruple to hell that ever the devil could have made you our delight What a hodge pudding a bag of flax PAGE A puff'd man Old cold wither'd and of intolerable entrails And one that is as slanderous as Satan And as poor as Job And as wicked as his wife And given

proportion held in love The truth is she and I long since contracted Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us Th ' offence is holy that she hath committed And this deceit loses the name of craft Of disobedience or unduteous title Since therein she doth evitate and shun A thousand irreligious cursed hours Which forced marriage would have brought upon her Stand not amaz'd here is no remedy In

days Good husband let us every one go home And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire Sir John and all Let it be so Sir John To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word For he to night shall lie with Mistress Ford Exeunt Now fair Hippolyta our nuptial hour Draws on apace four happy days bring in Another moon but O methinks how slow This old moon wanes She lingers my desires Like to a step dame or a dowager Long withering out a young man 's revenue Four days will quickly steep themselves in night Four nights will quickly dream away the time And then the moon like to a silver bow New bent in heaven shall behold the night Of our solemnities Go Philostrate Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth Turn melancholy forth to funerals The pale companion is not for our pomp Exit PHILOSTRATE Hippolyta I woo'd thee with my sword And won thy love doing thee injuries But I will we d thee in another key With pomp with triumph and with revelling Happy be Theseus our renowned Duke Thanks good Egeus what 's the news with thee Full of vexation come I with complaint Against my child my daughter Hermia Stand forth Demetrius My noble lord This man hath my consent to marry her Stand forth Lysander And my gracious Duke This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child Thou thou Lysander thou hast given her rhymes And interchang'd love tokens with my child Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung With feigning voice verses of feigning love And stol'n the impression of her fantasy With bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits Knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats- messengers Of strong prevailment in unhardened youth With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter 's heart Turn'd her obedience which is due to me To stubborn harshness And my gracious Duke Be it so she will not here before your Grace Consent to marry with Demetrius I beg the ancient privilege of Athens As she is mine I may dispose of her Which shall be either to this gentleman Or to her death according to our law Immediately provided in that case What say you Hermia Be advis'd fair maid To you your father should be as a god One that compos'd your beauties yea and one To whom you are but as a form in wax By him imprinted and within his power To leave the figure or disfigure it Demetrius is a worthy gentleman So is Lysander In himself he is But in this kind wanting your father 's voice The other must be held the worthier I would my father look'd but with my eyes Rather your eyes must with his judgment look I do entreat your Grace to pardon me I know not by what power I am made bold Nor how it may concern my modesty In such a presence here to plead my thoughts But I beseech your Grace that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case If I refuse to we d Demetrius Either to die the death or to abjure For ever the society of men Therefore fair Hermia question your desires Know of your youth examine well your blood Whether if you yield not to your father 's choice You can endure the livery of a nun For aye to be shady cloister mew'd To live a barren sister all your life Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon Thrice blessed they that master so their blood To undergo such maiden pilgrimage But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd Than that which withering on the virgin thorn Grows lives and dies in single blessedness So will I grow so live so die my lord Ere I will yield my virgin patent up Unto his lordship whose unwished yoke My soul consents not to give sovereignty Take time to pause and by the next new moon- The sealing day betwixt my love and me For everlasting bond of fellowship- Upon that day either prepare to die For disobedience to your father 's will Or else to we d Demetrius as he would Or on Diana 's altar to protest For aye austerity and single life Relent sweet Hermia and Lysander yield Thy crazed title to my certain right You have her father 's love Demetrius Let me have Hermia 's do you marry him Scornful Lysander true he hath my love And what is mine my love shall render him And she is mine and all my right of her I do estate unto Demetrius I am my lord as well deriv'd as he As well possess'd my love is more than his My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd If not with vantage as Demetrius ' And which is more than all these boasts can be I am belov'd of beauteous Hermia Why should not I then prosecute my right Demetrius I 'll avouch it to his head Made love to Nedar 's daughter Helena And won her soul and she sweet lady dotes Devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry Upon this spotted and inconstant man I must confess that I have heard so much And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof But being over full of self affairs My mind did lose it But Demetrius come And come Egeus you shall go with me I have some private schooling for you both For you fair Hermia look you arm yourself To fit your fancies to your father 's will Or else the law of Athens yields you up- Which by no means we may extenuate- To death or to a vow of single life Come my Hippolyta what cheer my love Demetrius and Egeus go along I must employ you in some business Against our nuptial and confer with you Of something nearly that concerns yourselves With duty and desire we follow you How now my love Why is your cheek so pale How chance the roses there do fade so fast Belike for want of rain which I could well Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes Ay me for aught that I could ever read Could ever hear by tale or history The course of true love never did run smooth But either it was different in blood- O cross too high to be enthrall'd to low Or else misgraffed in respect of years- O spite too old to be engag'd to young Or else it stood upon the choice of friends- O hell to choose love by another 's eyes Or if there were a sympathy in choice War death or sickness did lay siege to it Making it momentary as a sound Swift as a shadow short as any dream Brief as the lightning in the collied night That in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth And ere a man hath power to say ' Behold ' The jaws of darkness do devour it up So quick bright things come to confusion If then true lovers have ever cross'd It stands as an edict in destiny Then let us teach our trial patience Because it is a customary cross As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs Wishes and tears poor Fancy 's followers A good persuasion therefore hear me Hermia I have a widow aunt a dowager Of great revenue and she hath no child- From Athens is her house remote seven leagues- And she respects me as her only son There gentle Hermia may I marry thee And to that place the sharp Athenian law Can not pursue us If thou lovest me then Steal forth thy father 's house to morrow night And in the wood a league without the town Where I did meet thee once with Helena To do observance to a morn of May There will I stay for thee My good Lysander I swear to thee by Cupid 's strongest bow By his best arrow with the golden head By the simplicity of Venus ' doves By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queen When the false Troyan under sail was seen By all the vows that ever men have broke In number more than ever women spoke In that same place thou hast appointed me To morrow truly will I meet with thee Keep promise love Look here comes Helena God speed fair Helena Whither away Call you me fair That fair again unsay Demetrius loves your fair O happy fair Your eyes are lode stars and your tongue 's sweet air More tuneable than lark to shepherd 's ear When wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear Sickness is catching O were favour so Yours would I catch fair Hermia ere I go My ear should catch your voice my eye your eye My tongue should catch your tongue 's sweet melody Were the world mine Demetrius being bated The rest I 'd give to be to you translated O teach me how you look and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius ' heart I frown upon him yet he loves me still O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill I give him curses yet he gives me love O that my prayers could such affection move The more I hate the more he follows me The more I love the more he hateth me His folly Helena is no fault of mine None but your beauty would that fault were mine Take comfort he no more shall see my face Lysander and myself will fly this place Before the time I did Lysander see Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me O then what graces in my love do dwell That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell Helen to you our minds we will unfold To morrow night when Phoebe doth behold Her silver visage in the wat'ry glass Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass A time that lovers ' flights doth still conceal Through Athens ' gates have we devis'd to steal And in the wood where often you and I Upon faint primrose beds were wo nt to lie Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet There my Lysander and myself shall meet And thence from Athens turn away our eyes To seek new friends and stranger companies Farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius Keep word Lysander we must starve our sight From lovers ' food till morrow deep midnight I will my Hermia Exit HERMIA Helena adieu As you on him Demetrius dote on you Exit How happy some o'er other some can be Through Athens I am thought as fair as she But what of that Demetrius thinks not so He will not know what all but he do know And as he errs doting on Hermia 's eyes So I admiring of his qualities Things base and vile holding no quantity Love can transpose to form and dignity Love looks not with the eyes but with the mind And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind Nor hath Love 's mind of any judgment taste Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste And therefore is Love said to be a child Because in choice he is so oft beguil'd As waggish boys in game themselves forswear So the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia 's eyne He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt So he dissolv'd and show'rs of oaths did melt I will go tell him of fair Hermia 's flight Then to the wood will he to morrow night Pursue her and for this intelligence If I have thanks it is a dear expense But herein mean I to enrich my pain To have his sight thither and back again Exit Is all our company here You were best to call them generally man by man according to the scrip Here is the scroll of every man 's name which is thought fit through all Athens to play in our interlude before the Duke and the Duchess on his wedding day at night First good Peter Quince say what the play treats on then read the names of the actors and so grow to a point Marry our play is ' The most Lamentable Comedy and most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisby ' A very good piece of work I assure you and a merry Now good Peter Quince call forth your actors by the scroll Masters spread yourselves Answer as I call you Nick Bottom the weaver Ready Name what part I am for and proceed You Nick Bottom are set down for Pyramus What is Pyramus A lover or a tyrant A lover that kills himself most gallant for love That will ask some tears in the true performing of it If I do it let the audience look to their eyes I will move storms I will condole in some measure To the rest- yet my chief humour is for a tyrant I could play Ercles rarely or a part to tear a cat in to make all split Francis Flute the bellows mender Here Peter Quince Flute you must take Thisby on you What is Thisby A wand'ring knight It is the lady that Pyramus must love Nay faith let not me play a woman I have a beard coming That 's all one you shall play it in a mask and you may speak as small as you will An I may hide my face let me play Thisby too I 'll speak in a monstrous little voice ' Thisne Thisne ' Then speaking small ' Ah Pyramus my lover dear Thy Thisby dear and lady dear ' No no you must play Pyramus and Flute you Thisby Well proceed Robin Starveling the tailor Here Peter Quince Robin Starveling you must play Thisby 's mother Tom Snout the tinker Here Peter Quince You Pyramus ' father myself Thisby 's father Snug the joiner you the lion 's part And I hope here is a play fitted Have you the lion 's part written Pray you if it be give it me for I am slow of study You may do it extempore for it is nothing but roaring Let me play the lion too I will roar that I will do any man 's heart good to hear me I will roar that I will make the Duke say ' Let him roar again let him roar again ' An you should do it too terribly you would fright the Duchess and the ladies that they would shriek and that were enough to hang us all That would hang us every mother 's son I grant you friends if you should fright the ladies out of their wits they would have no more discretion but to hang us but I will aggravate my voice so that I will roar you as gently as any sucking dove I will roar you an ' twere any nightingale You can play no part but Pyramus for Pyramus is a sweet fac'd man a proper man as one shall see in a summer 's day a most lovely gentleman like man therefore you must needs play Pyramus Well I will undertake it What beard were I best to play it in Why what you will I will discharge it in either your straw colour beard your orange tawny beard your purple in grain beard or your French crown colour beard your perfect yellow Some of your French crowns have no hair at all and then you will play bare fac'd But masters here are your parts and I am to entreat you request you and desire you to con them by to morrow night and meet me in the palace wood a mile without the town by moonlight there will we rehearse for if we meet in the city we shall be dogg'd with company and our devices known In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties such as our play wants I pray you fail me not We will meet and there we may rehearse most obscenely and courageously Take pains be perfect adieu At the Duke 's oak we meet Enough hold or cut bow strings Exeunt How now spirit whither wander you Over hill over dale The King doth keep his revels here to night Take heed the Queen come not within his sight For Oberon is passing fell and wrath Because that she as her attendant hath A lovely boy stolen from an Indian king She never had so sweet a changeling And jealous Oberon would have the child Knight of his train to trace the forests wild But she perforce withholds the loved boy Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy And now they never meet in grove or green By fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen But they do square that all their elves for fear Creep into acorn cups and hide them there Either I mistake your shape and making quite Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Goodfellow Are not you he That frights the maidens of the villagery Skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern And bootless make the breathless housewife churn And sometime make the drink to bear no barm Mislead night wanderers laughing at their harm Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck You do their work and they shall have good luck Are not you he Thou speakest aright I am that merry wanderer of the night I jest to Oberon and make him smile When I a fat and bean fed horse beguile Neighing in likeness of a filly foal And sometime lurk I in a gossip 's bowl In very likeness of a roasted crab And when she drinks against her lips I bob And on her withered dewlap pour the ale The wisest aunt telling the saddest tale Sometime for three foot stool mistaketh me Then slip I from her bum down topples she And ' tailor ' cries and falls into a cough And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear A merrier hour was never wasted there But room fairy here comes Oberon And here my mistress Would that he were gone Ill met by moonlight proud Titania What jealous Oberon Fairies skip hence I have forsworn his bed and company Tarry rash wanton am not I thy lord Then I must be thy lady but I know When thou hast stolen away from fairy land And in the shape of Corin sat all day Playing on pipes of corn and versing love To amorous Phillida Why art thou here Come from the farthest steep of India But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love To Theseus must be wedded and you come To give their bed joy and prosperity How canst thou thus for shame Titania Glance at my credit with Hippolyta Knowing I know thy love to Theseus Didst not thou lead him through the glimmering night From Perigouna whom he ravished And make him with fair Aegles break his faith With Ariadne and Antiopa These are the forgeries of jealousy And never since the middle summer 's spring Met we on hill in dale forest or mead By paved fountain or by rushy brook Or in the beached margent of the sea To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport Therefore the winds piping to us in vain As in revenge have suck'd up from the sea Contagious fogs which falling in the land Hath every pelting river made so proud That they have overborne their continents The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain The ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard The fold stands empty in the drowned field And crows are fatted with the murrion flock The nine men 's morris is fill'd up with mud And the quaint mazes in the wanton green For lack of tread are undistinguishable The human mortals want their winter here No night is now with hymn or carol blest Therefore the moon the governess of floods Pale in her anger washes all the air That rheumatic diseases do abound And thorough this distemperature we see The seasons alter hoary headed frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose And on old Hiems ' thin and icy crown An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds Is as in mockery set The spring the summer The childing autumn angry winter change Their wonted liveries and the mazed world By their increase now knows not which is which And this same progeny of evils comes From our debate from our dissension We are their parents and original Do you amend it then it lies in you Why should Titania cross her Oberon I do but beg a little changeling boy To be my henchman Set your heart at rest The fairy land buys not the child of me His mother was a vot'ress of my order And in the spiced Indian air by night Full often hath she gossip'd by my side And sat with me on Neptune 's yellow sands Marking th ' embarked traders on the flood When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive And grow big bellied with the wanton wind Which she with pretty and with swimming gait Following- her womb then rich with my young squire- Would imitate and sail upon the land To fetch me trifles and return again As from a voyage rich with merchandise But she being mortal of that boy did die And for her sake do I rear up her boy And for her sake I will not part with him How long within this wood intend you stay Perchance till after Theseus ' wedding day If you will patiently dance in our round And see our moonlight revels go with us If not shun me and I will spare your haunts Give me that boy and I will go with thee Not for thy fairy kingdom Fairies away We shall chide downright if I longer stay Well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove Till I torment thee for this injury My gentle Puck come hither Thou rememb'rest Since once I sat upon a promontory And heard a mermaid on a dolphin 's back Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath That the rude sea grew civil at her song And certain stars shot madly from their spheres To hear the sea maid 's music I remember That very time I saw but thou couldst not Flying between the cold moon and the earth Cupid all arm'd a certain aim he took At a fair vestal throned by the west And loos'd his love shaft smartly from his bow As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts But I might see young Cupid 's fiery shaft Quench'd in the chaste beams of the wat'ry moon And the imperial vot'ress passed on In maiden meditation fancy free Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell It fell upon a little western flower Before milk white now purple with love 's wound And maidens call it Love in idleness Fetch me that flow'r the herb I showed thee once The juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid Will make or man or woman madly dote Upon the next live creature that it sees Fetch me this herb and be thou here again Ere the leviathan can swim a league I 'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes Exit PUCK Having once this juice I 'll watch Titania when she is asleep And drop the liquor of it in her eyes The next thing then she waking looks upon Be it on lion bear or wolf or bull On meddling monkey or on busy ape She shall pursue it with the soul of love And ere I take this charm from off her sight As I can take it with another herb I 'll make her render up her page to me But who comes here I am invisible And I will overhear their conference I love thee not therefore pursue me not Where is Lysander and fair Hermia The one I 'll slay the other slayeth me Thou told'st me they were stol'n unto this wood And here am I and wood within this wood Because I can not meet my Hermia Hence get thee gone and follow me no more You draw me you hard hearted adamant But yet you draw not iron for my heart Is true as steel Leave you your power to draw And I shall have no power to follow you Do I entice you Do I speak you fair Or rather do I not in plainest truth Tell you I do not nor I can not love you And even for that do I love you the more I am your spaniel and Demetrius The more you beat me I will fawn on you Use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me Neglect me lose me only give me leave Unworthy as I am to follow you What worser place can I beg in your love And yet a place of high respect with me Than to be used as you use your dog Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit For I am sick when I do look on thee And I am sick when I look not on you You do impeach your modesty too much To leave the city and commit yourself Into the hands of one that loves you not To trust the opportunity of night And the ill counsel of a desert place With the rich worth of your virginity Your virtue is my privilege for that It is not night when I do see your face Therefore I think I am not in the night Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company For you in my respect are all the world Then how can it be said I am alone When all the world is here to look on me I 'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts The wildest hath not such a heart as you Run when you will the story shall be chang'd Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase The dove pursues the griffin the mild hind Makes speed to catch the tiger- bootless speed When cowardice pursues and valour flies I will not stay thy questions let me go Or if thou follow me do not believe But I shall do thee mischief in the wood Ay in the temple in the town the field You do me mischief Fie Demetrius Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex We can not fight for love as men may do We should be woo'd and were not made to woo Fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love Ay there it is I pray thee give it me I know a bank where the wild thyme blows Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows Quite over canopied with luscious woodbine With sweet musk roses and with eglantine There sleeps Titania sometime of the night Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in And with the juice of this I 'll streak her eyes And make her full of hateful fantasies Take thou some of it and seek through this grove A sweet Athenian lady is in love With a disdainful youth anoint his eyes But do it when the next thing he espies May be the lady Thou shalt know the man By the Athenian garments he hath on Effect it with some care that he may prove More fond on her than she upon her love And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow Fear not my lord your servant shall do so Exeunt Come now a roundel and a fairy song Then for the third part of a minute hence Some to kill cankers in the musk rose buds Some war with rere mice for their leathern wings To make my small elves coats and some keep back The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders At our quaint spirits Sing me now asleep Then to your offices and let me rest You spotted snakes with double tongue Philomel with melody Weaving spiders come not here Philomel with melody etc TITANIA Sleeps Hence away now all is well What thou seest when thou dost wake Do it for thy true love take Love and languish for his sake Be it ounce or cat or bear Pard or boar with bristled hair In thy eye that shall appear When thou wak'st it is thy dear Wake when some vile thing is near Exit Fair love you faint with wand'ring in the wood And to speak troth I have forgot our way We 'll rest us Hermia if you think it good And tarry for the comfort of the day Be it so Lysander find you out a bed For I upon this bank will rest my head One turf shall serve as pillow for us both One heart one bed two bosoms and one troth Nay good Lysander for my sake my dear Lie further off yet do not lie so near O take the sense sweet of my innocence Love takes the meaning in love 's conference I mean that my heart unto yours is knit So that but one heart we can make of it Two bosoms interchained with an oath So then two bosoms and a single troth Then by your side no bed room me deny For lying so Hermia I do not lie Lysander riddles very prettily Now much beshrew my manners and my pride If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied But gentle friend for love and courtesy Lie further off in human modesty Such separation as may well be said Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid So far be distant and good night sweet friend Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end Amen amen to that fair prayer say I And then end life when I end loyalty Here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest With half that wish the wisher 's eyes be press'd Through the forest have I gone Stay though thou kill me sweet Demetrius I charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus O wilt thou darkling leave me Do not so Stay on thy peril I alone will go Exit O I am out of breath in this fond chase The more my prayer the lesser is my grace Happy is Hermia wheresoe'er she lies For she hath blessed and attractive eyes How came her eyes so bright Not with salt tears If so my eyes are oft'ner wash'd than hers No no I am as ugly as a bear For beasts that meet me run away for fear Therefore no marvel though Demetrius Do as a monster fly my presence thus What wicked and dissembling glass of mine Made me compare with Hermia 's sphery eyne But who is here Lysander on the ground Dead or asleep I see no blood no wound Lysander if you live good sir awake Waking And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake Transparent Helena Nature shows art That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart Where is Demetrius O how fit a word Is that vile name to perish on my sword Do not say so Lysander say not so What though he love your Hermia Lord what though Yet Hermia still loves you then be content Content with Hermia No I do repent The tedious minutes I with her have spent Not Hermia but Helena I love Who will not change a raven for a dove The will of man is by his reason sway'd And reason says you are the worthier maid Things growing are not ripe until their season So I being young till now ripe not to reason And touching now the point of human skill Reason becomes the marshal to my will And leads me to your eyes where I o'erlook Love 's stories written in Love 's richest book Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born When at your hands did I deserve this scorn Is't not enough is't not enough young man That I did never no nor never can Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius ' eye But you must flout my insufficiency Good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do In such disdainful manner me to woo But fare you well perforce I must confess I thought you lord of more true gentleness O that a lady of one man refus'd Should of another therefore be abus'd Exit She sees not Hermia Hermia sleep thou there And never mayst thou come Lysander near For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomach brings Or as the heresies that men do leave Are hated most of those they did deceive So thou my surfeit and my heresy Of all be hated but the most of me And all my powers address your love and might To honour Helen and to be her knight Exit Starting Help me Lysander help me do thy best To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast Ay me for pity What a dream was here Lysander look how I do quake with fear Methought a serpent eat my heart away And you sat smiling at his cruel prey Lysander What remov'd Lysander lord What out of hearing gone No sound no word Alack where are you Speak an if you hear Speak of all loves I swoon almost with fear No Then I well perceive you are not nigh Either death or you I 'll find immediately Exit Are we all met Pat pat and here 's a marvellous convenient place for our rehearsal This green plot shall be our stage this hawthorn brake our tiring house and we will do it in action as we will do it before the Duke Peter Quince What sayest thou bully Bottom There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisby that will never please First Pyramus must draw a sword to kill himself which the ladies can not abide How answer you that By'r lakin a parlous fear I believe we must leave the killing out when all is done Not a whit I have a device to make all well Write me a prologue and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm with our swords and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeed and for the more better assurance tell them that I Pyramus am not Pyramus but Bottom the weaver This will put them out of fear Well we will have such a prologue and it shall be written in eight and six No make it two more let it be written in eight and eight Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion I fear it I promise you Masters you ought to consider with yourself to bring in- God shield us!- a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing for there is not a more fearful wild fowl than your lion living and we ought to look to't Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion Nay you must name his name and half his face must be seen through the lion 's neck and he himself must speak through saying thus or to the same defect ' Ladies ' or ' Fair ladies I would wish you ' or ' I would request you ' or ' I would entreat you not to fear not to tremble My life for yours If you think I come hither as a lion it were pity of my life No I am no such thing I am a man as other men are ' And there indeed let him name his name and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner Well it shall be so But there is two hard things- that is to bring the moonlight into a chamber for you know Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight Doth the moon shine that night we play our play A calendar a calendar Look in the almanack find out moonshine find out moonshine Yes it doth shine that night Why then may you leave a casement of the great chamber window where we play open and the moon may shine in at the casement Ay or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lantern and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person of Moonshine Then there is another thing we must have a wall in the great chamber for Pyramus and Thisby says the story did talk through the chink of a wall You can never bring in a wall What say you Bottom Some man or other must present Wall and let him have some plaster or some loam or some rough cast about him to signify wall and let him hold his fingers thus and through that cranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper If that may be then all is well Come sit down every mother 's son and rehearse your parts Pyramus you begin when you have spoken your speech enter into that brake and so every one according to his cue What hempen homespuns have we swagg'ring here So near the cradle of the Fairy Queen What a play toward I 'll be an auditor An actor too perhaps if I see cause Speak Pyramus Thisby stand forth Thisby the flowers of odious savours sweet- ' Odious'- odorous -odours savours sweet So hath thy breath my dearest Thisby dear But hark a voice Stay thou but here awhile And by and by I will to thee appear Exit A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here Exit Must I speak now Ay marry must you for you must understand he goes but to see a noise that he heard and is to come again Most radiant Pyramus most lily white of hue Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew As true as truest horse that would never tire I 'll meet thee Pyramus at Ninny 's tomb ' Ninus ' tomb ' man Why you must not speak that yet that you answer to Pyramus You speak all your part at once cues and all Pyramus enter your cue is past it is ' never tire ' O- As true as truest horse that y et would never tire If I were fair Thisby I were only thine O monstrous O strange We are haunted Pray masters fly masters Help I 'll follow you I 'll lead you about a round Through bog through bush through brake through brier Sometime a horse I 'll be sometime a hound A hog a headless bear sometime a fire And neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn Like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn Why do they run away This is a knavery of them to make me afeard O Bottom thou art chang'd What do I see on thee What do you see You see an ass head of your own do you Bless thee Bottom bless thee Thou art translated I see their knavery this is to make an ass of me to fright me if they could But I will not stir from this place do what they can I will walk up and down here and will sing that they shall hear I am not afraid Sings What angel wakes me from my flow'ry bed Sings I pray thee gentle mortal sing again Mine ear is much enamoured of thy note So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape And thy fair virtue 's force perforce doth move me On the first view to say to swear I love thee Methinks mistress you should have little reason for that And yet to say the truth reason and love keep little company together now a days The more the pity that some honest neighbours will not make them friends Nay I can gleek upon occasion Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful Not so neither but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood I have enough to serve mine own turn Out of this wood do not desire to go Thou shalt remain here whether thou wilt or no I am a spirit of no common rate The summer still doth tend upon my state And I do love thee therefore go with me I 'll give thee fairies to attend on thee And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep And I will purge thy mortal grossness so That thou shalt like an airy spirit go Peaseblossom Cobweb Moth and Mustardseed Ready And I. And I. And I. Where shall we go Be kind and courteous to this gentleman Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes Feed him with apricocks and dewberries With purple grapes green figs and mulberries The honey bags steal from the humble bees And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs And light them at the fiery glow worm 's eyes To have my love to bed and to arise And pluck the wings from painted butterflies To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes Nod to him elves and do him courtesies Hail mortal Hail Hail Hail I cry your worships mercy heartily I beseech your worship 's name Cobweb I shall desire you of more acquaintance good Master Cobweb If I cut my finger I shall make bold with you Your name honest gentleman Peaseblossom I pray you commend me to Mistress Squash your mother and to Master Peascod your father Good Master Peaseblossom I shall desire you of more acquaintance too Your name I beseech you sir Mustardseed Good Master Mustardseed I know your patience well That same cowardly giant like ox beef hath devour'd many a gentleman of your house I promise you your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now I desire you of more acquaintance good Master Mustardseed Come wait upon him lead him to my bower The moon methinks looks with a wat'ry eye And when she weeps weeps every little flower Lamenting some enforced chastity Tie up my love 's tongue bring him silently Exeunt I wonder if Titania be awak'd Then what it was that next came in her eye Which she must dote on in extremity My mistress with a monster is in love Near to her close and consecrated bower While she was in her dull and sleeping hour A crew of patches rude mechanicals That work for bread upon Athenian stalls Were met together to rehearse a play Intended for great Theseus ' nuptial day The shallowest thickskin of that barren sort Who Pyramus presented in their sport Forsook his scene and ent'red in a brake When I did him at this advantage take An ass 's nole I fixed on his head Anon his Thisby must be answered And forth my mimic comes When they him spy As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye Or russet pated choughs many in sort Rising and cawing at the gun 's report Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky So at his sight away his fellows fly And at our stamp here o'er and o'er one falls He murder cries and help from Athens calls Their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong Made senseless things begin to do them wrong For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch Some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch I led them on in this distracted fear And left sweet Pyramus translated there When in that moment so it came to pass Titania wak'd and straightway lov'd an ass This falls out better than I could devise But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian 's eyes With the love juice as I did bid thee do I took him sleeping- that is finish'd too- And the Athenian woman by his side That when he wak'd of force she must be ey'd Stand close this is the same Athenian This is the woman but not this the man O why rebuke you him that loves you so Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe Now I but chide but I should use thee worse For thou I fear hast given me cause to curse If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep Being o'er shoes in blood plunge in the deep And kill me too The sun was not so true unto the day As he to me Would he have stolen away From sleeping Hermia I 'll believe as soon This whole earth may be bor'd and that the moon May through the centre creep and so displease Her brother 's noontide with th ' Antipodes It can not be but thou hast murd'red him So should a murderer look- so dead so grim So should the murdered look and so should I Pierc'd through the heart with your stern cruelty Yet you the murderer look as bright as clear As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere What 's this to my Lysander Where is he Ah good Demetrius wilt thou give him me I had rather give his carcass to my hounds Out dog out cur Thou driv'st me past the bounds Of maiden 's patience Hast thou slain him then Henceforth be never numb'red among men O once tell true tell true even for my sake Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake And hast thou kill'd him sleeping O brave touch Could not a worm an adder do so much An adder did it for with doubler tongue Than thine thou serpent never adder stung You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood I am not guilty of Lysander 's blood Nor is he dead for aught that I can tell I pray thee tell me then that he is well An if I could what should I get therefore A privilege never to see me more And from thy hated presence part I so See me no more whether he be dead or no Exit There is no following her in this fierce vein Here therefore for a while I will remain So sorrow 's heaviness doth heavier grow For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe Which now in some slight measure it will pay If for his tender here I make some stay Lies down What hast thou done Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the love juice on some true love 's sight Of thy misprision must perforce ensue Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true Then fate o'er rules that one man holding troth A million fail confounding oath on oath About the wood go swifter than the wind And Helena of Athens look thou find All fancy sick she is and pale of cheer With sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear By some illusion see thou bring her here I 'll charm his eyes against she do appear I go I go look how I go Swifter than arrow from the Tartar 's bow Exit Flower of this purple dye Captain of our fairy band Stand aside The noise they make Then will two at once woo one Why should you think that I should woo in scorn Scorn and derision never come in tears Look when I vow I weep and vows so born In their nativity all truth appears How can these things in me seem scorn to you Bearing the badge of faith to prove them true You do advance your cunning more and more When truth kills truth O devilish holy fray These vows are Hermia 's Will you give her o'er Weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh Your vows to her and me put in two scales Will even weigh and both as light as tales I hod no judgment when to her I swore Nor none in my mind now you give her o'er Demetrius loves her and he loves not you Awaking O Helen goddess nymph perfect divine To what my love shall I compare thine eyne Crystal is muddy O how ripe in show Thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow That pure congealed white high Taurus ' snow Fann'd with the eastern wind turns to a crow When thou hold'st up thy hand O let me kiss This princess of pure white this seal of bliss O spite O hell I see you all are bent To set against me for your merriment If you were civil and knew courtesy You would not do me thus much injury Can you not hate me as I know you do But you must join in souls to mock me too If you were men as men you are in show You would not use a gentle lady so To vow and swear and superpraise my parts When I am sure you hate me with your hearts You both are rivals and love Hermia And now both rivals to mock Helena A trim exploit a manly enterprise To conjure tears up in a poor maid 's eyes With your derision None of noble sort Would so offend a virgin and extort A poor soul 's patience all to make you sport You are unkind Demetrius be not so For you love Hermia This you know I know And here with all good will with all my heart In Hermia 's love I yield you up my part And yours of Helena to me bequeath Whom I do love and will do till my death Never did mockers waste more idle breath Lysander keep thy Hermia I will none If e'er I lov'd her all that love is gone My heart to her but as guest wise sojourn'd And now to Helen is it home return'd There to remain Helen it is not so Disparage not the faith thou dost not know Lest to thy peril thou aby it dear Look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear Dark night that from the eye his function takes The ear more quick of apprehension makes Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense It pays the hearing double recompense Thou art not by mine eye Lysander found Mine ear I thank it brought me to thy sound But why unkindly didst thou leave me so Why should he stay whom love doth press to go What love could press Lysander from my side Lysander 's love that would not let him bide- Fair Helena who more engilds the night Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light Why seek'st thou me Could not this make thee know The hate I bare thee made me leave thee so You speak not as you think it can not be Lo she is one of this confederacy Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three To fashion this false sport in spite of me Injurious Hermia most ungrateful maid Have you conspir'd have you with these contriv'd To bait me with this foul derision Is all the counsel that we two have shar'd The sisters ' vows the hours that we have spent When we have chid the hasty footed time For parting us- O is all forgot All school days ' friendship childhood innocence We Hermia like two artificial gods Have with our needles created both one flower Both on one sampler sitting on one cushion Both warbling of one song both in one key As if our hands our sides voices and minds Had been incorporate So we grew together Like to a double cherry seeming parted But yet an union in partition Two lovely berries moulded on one stern So with two seeming bodies but one heart Two of the first like coats in heraldry Due but to one and crowned with one crest And will you rent our ancient love asunder To join with men in scorning your poor friend It is not friendly ' tis not maidenly Our sex as well as I may chide you for it Though I alone do feel the injury I am amazed at your passionate words I scorn you not it seems that you scorn me Have you not set Lysander as in scorn To follow me and praise my eyes and face And made your other love Demetrius Who even but now did spurn me with his foot To call me goddess nymph divine and rare Precious celestial Wherefore speaks he this To her he hates And wherefore doth Lysander Deny your love so rich within his soul And tender me forsooth affection But by your setting on by your consent What though I be not so in grace as you So hung upon with love so fortunate But miserable most to love unlov'd This you should pity rather than despise I understand not what you mean by this Ay do- persever counterfeit sad looks Make mouths upon me when I turn my back Wink each at other hold the sweet jest up This sport well carried shall be chronicled If you have any pity grace or manners You would not make me such an argument But fare ye well ' tis partly my own fault Which death or absence soon shall remedy Stay gentle Helena hear my excuse My love my life my soul fair Helena O excellent Sweet do not scorn her so If she can not entreat I can compel Thou canst compel no more than she entreat Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers Helen I love thee by my life I do I swear by that which I will lose for thee To prove him false that says I love thee not I say I love thee more than he can do If thou say so withdraw and prove it too Quick come Lysander whereto tends all this Away you Ethiope No no he will Seem to break loose- take on as you would follow But yet come not You are a tame man go Hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent Why are you grown so rude What change is this Sweet love Thy love Out tawny Tartar out Out loathed med'cine O hated potion hence Do you not jest Yes sooth and so do you Demetrius I will keep my word with thee I would I had your bond for I perceive A weak bond holds you I 'll not trust your word What should I hurt her strike her kill her dead Although I hate her I 'll not harm her so What Can you do me greater harm than hate Hate me wherefore O me what news my love Am not I Hermia Are not you Lysander I am as fair now as I was erewhile Since night you lov'd me yet since night you left me Why then you left me- O the gods forbid!- In earnest shall I say Ay by my life And never did desire to see thee more Therefore be out of hope of question of doubt Be certain nothing truer ' tis no jest That I do hate thee and love Helena O me you juggler you cankerblossom You thief of love What Have you come by night And stol'n my love 's heart from him Fine i ' faith Have you no modesty no maiden shame No touch of bashfulness What Will you tear Impatient answers from my gentle tongue Fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you ' Puppet ' why so Ay that way goes the game Now I perceive that she hath made compare Between our statures she hath urg'd her height And with her personage her tall personage Her height forsooth she hath prevail'd with him And are you grown so high in his esteem Because I am so dwarfish and so low How low am I thou painted maypole Speak How low am I I am not yet so low But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes I pray you though you mock me gentlemen Let her not hurt me I was never curst I have no gift at all in shrewishness I am a right maid for my cowardice Let her not strike me You perhaps may think Because she is something lower than myself That I can match her ' Lower ' hark again Good Hermia do not be so bitter with me I evermore did love you Hermia Did ever keep your counsels never wrong'd you Save that in love unto Demetrius I told him of your stealth unto this wood He followed you for love I followed him But he hath chid me hence and threat'ned me To strike me spurn me nay to kill me too And now so you will let me quiet go To Athens will I bear my folly back And follow you no further Let me go You see how simple and how fond I am Why get you gone Who is't that hinders you A foolish heart that I leave here behind What with Lysander With Demetrius Be not afraid she shall not harm thee Helena No sir she shall not though you take her part O when she is angry she is keen and shrewd She was a vixen when she went to school And though she be but little she is fierce ' Little ' again Nothing but ' low ' and ' little ' Why will you suffer her to flout me thus Let me come to her Get you gone you dwarf You minimus of hind'ring knot grass made You bead you acorn You are too officious In her behalf that scorns your services Let her alone speak not of Helena Take not her part for if thou dost intend Never so little show of love to her Thou shalt aby it Now she holds me not Now follow if thou dar'st to try whose right Of thine or mine is most in Helena Follow Nay I 'll go with thee cheek by jowl You mistress all this coil is long of you Nay go not back I will not trust you I Nor longer stay in your curst company Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray My legs are longer though to run away Exit I am amaz'd and know not what to say Exit This is thy negligence Still thou mistak'st Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully Believe me king of shadows I mistook Did not you tell me I should know the man By the Athenian garments he had on And so far blameless proves my enterprise That I have ' nointed an Athenian 's eyes And so far am I glad it so did sort As this their jangling I esteem a sport Thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight Hie therefore Robin overcast the night The starry welkin cover thou anon With drooping fog as black as Acheron And lead these testy rivals so astray As one come not within another 's way Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong And sometime rail thou like Demetrius And from each other look thou lead them thus Till o'er their brows death counterfeiting sleep With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep Then crush this herb into Lysander 's eye Whose liquor hath this virtuous property To take from thence all error with his might And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight When they next wake all this derision Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision And back to Athens shall the lovers wend With league whose date till death shall never end Whiles I in this affair do thee employ I 'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy And then I will her charmed eye release From monster 's view and all things shall be peace My fairy lord this must be done with haste For night 's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast And yonder shines Aurora 's harbinger At whose approach ghosts wand'ring here and there Troop home to churchyards Damned spirits all That in cross ways and floods have burial Already to their wormy beds are gone For fear lest day should look their shames upon They wilfully themselves exil'd from light And must for aye consort with black brow'd night But we are spirits of another sort I with the Morning 's love have oft made sport And like a forester the groves may tread Even till the eastern gate all fiery red Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams But notwithstanding haste make no delay We may effect this business yet ere day Exit OBERON Up and down up and down Where art thou proud Demetrius Speak thou now Here villain drawn and ready Where art thou I will be with thee straight Follow me then To plainer ground Exit LYSANDER as following the voice Lysander speak again Thou runaway thou coward art thou fled Speak In some bush Where dost thou hide thy head Thou coward art thou bragging to the stars Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars And wilt not come Come recreant come thou child I 'll whip thee with a rod He is defil'd That draws a sword on thee Yea art thou there Follow my voice we 'll try no manhood here Exeunt He goes before me and still dares me on When I come where he calls then he is gone The villain is much lighter heel'd than I. I followed fast but faster he did fly That fallen am I in dark uneven way And here will rest me Lies down Come thou gentle day For if but once thou show me thy grey light I 'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite Sleeps Ho ho ho Coward why com'st thou not Abide me if thou dar'st for well I wot Thou run'st before me shifting every place And dar'st not stand nor look me in the face Where art thou now Come hither I am here Nay then thou mock'st me Thou shalt buy this dear If ever I thy face by daylight see Now go thy way Faintness constraineth me To measure out my length on this cold bed By day 's approach look to be visited O weary night O long and tedious night Abate thy hours Shine comforts from the east That I may back to Athens by daylight From these that my poor company detest And sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrow 's eye Steal me awhile from mine own company Sleeps Yet but three Come one more Never so weary never so in woe Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers I can no further crawl no further go My legs can keep no pace with my desires Here will I rest me till the break of day Heavens shield Lysander if they mean a fray On the ground Come sit thee down upon this flow'ry bed While I thy amiable cheeks do coy And stick musk roses in thy sleek smooth head And kiss thy fair large ears my gentle joy Where 's Peaseblossom Ready Scratch my head Peaseblossom Where 's Mounsieur Cobweb Ready Mounsieur Cobweb good mounsieur get you your weapons in your hand and kill me a red hipp'd humble bee on the top of a thistle and good mounsieur bring me the honey bag Do not fret yourself too much in the action mounsieur and good mounsieur have a care the honey bag break not I would be loath to have you overflown with a honey bag signior Where 's Mounsieur Mustardseed Ready Give me your neaf Mounsieur Mustardseed Pray you leave your curtsy good mounsieur What 's your will Nothing good mounsieur but to help Cavalery Cobweb to scratch I must to the barber 's mounsieur for methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face and I am such a tender ass if my hair do but tickle me I must scratch What wilt thou hear some music my sweet love I have a reasonable good ear in music Let 's have the tongs and the bones Or say sweet love what thou desirest to eat Truly a peck of provender I could munch your good dry oats Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle of hay Good hay sweet hay hath no fellow I have a venturous fairy that shall seek The squirrel 's hoard and fetch thee new nuts I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas But I pray you let none of your people stir me I have an exposition of sleep come upon me Sleep thou and I will wind thee in my arms Fairies be gone and be all ways away Exeunt FAIRIES So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle Gently entwist the female ivy so Enrings the barky fingers of the elm O how I love thee how I dote on thee They sleep Advancing Welcome good Robin Seest thou this sweet My Oberon What visions have I seen Methought I was enamour'd of an ass There lies your love How came these things to pass O how mine eyes do loathe his visage now Silence awhile Robin take off this head Titania music call and strike more dead Than common sleep of all these five the sense Music ho music such as charmeth sleep Now when thou wak'st with thine own fool 's eyes peep Sound music Come my Queen take hands with me Fairy King attend and mark Then my Queen in silence sad Come my lord and in our flight Go one of you find out the forester For now our observation is perform'd And since we have the vaward of the day My love shall hear the music of my hounds Uncouple in the western valley let them go Dispatch I say and find the forester Exit an ATTENDANT We will fair Queen up to the mountain 's top And mark the musical confusion Of hounds and echo in conjunction I was with Hercules and Cadmus once When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear With hounds of Sparta never did I hear Such gallant chiding for besides the groves The skies the fountains every region near Seem'd all one mutual cry I never heard So musical a discord such sweet thunder My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind So flew'd so sanded and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew Crook knee'd and dew lapp'd like Thessalian bulls Slow in pursuit but match'd in mouth like bells Each under each A cry more tuneable Was never holla'd to nor cheer'd with horn In Crete in Sparta nor in Thessaly Judge when you hear But soft what nymphs are these My lord this is my daughter here asleep And this Lysander this Demetrius is This Helena old Nedar 's Helena I wonder of their being here together No doubt they rose up early to observe The rite of May and hearing our intent Came here in grace of our solemnity But speak Egeus is not this the day That Hermia should give answer of her choice It is my lord Go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns Pardon my lord I pray you all stand up I know you two are rival enemies How comes this gentle concord in the world That hatred is so far from jealousy To sleep by hate and fear no enmity My lord I shall reply amazedly Half sleep half waking but as yet I swear I can not truly say how I came here But as I think- for truly would I speak And now I do bethink me so it is- I came with Hermia hither Our intent Was to be gone from Athens where we might Without the peril of the Athenian law- Enough enough my Lord you have enough I beg the law the law upon his head They would have stol'n away they would Demetrius Thereby to have defeated you and me You of your wife and me of my consent Of my consent that she should be your wife My lord fair Helen told me of their stealth Of this their purpose hither to this wood And I in fury hither followed them Fair Helena in fancy following me But my good lord I wot not by what power- But by some power it is- my love to Hermia Melted as the snow seems to me now As the remembrance of an idle gaud Which in my childhood I did dote upon And all the faith the virtue of my heart The object and the pleasure of mine eye Is only Helena To her my lord Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia But like a sickness did I loathe this food But as in health come to my natural taste Now I do wish it love it long for it And will for evermore be true to it Fair lovers you are fortunately met Of this discourse we more will hear anon Egeus I will overbear your will For in the temple by and by with us These couples shall eternally be knit And for the morning now is something worn Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside Away with us to Athens three and three We 'll hold a feast in great solemnity Come Hippolyta These things seem small and undistinguishable Like far off mountains turned into clouds Methinks I see these things with parted eye When every thing seems double So methinks And I have found Demetrius like a jewel Mine own and not mine own Are you sure That we are awake It seems to me That yet we sleep we dream Do not you think The Duke was here and bid us follow him Yea and my father And Hippolyta And he did bid us follow to the temple Why then we are awake let 's follow him And by the way let us recount our dreams Exeunt Awaking When my cue comes call me and I will answer My next is ' Most fair Pyramus ' Heigh ho Peter Quince Flute the bellows mender Snout the tinker Starveling God 's my life stol'n hence and left me asleep I have had a most rare vision I have had a dream past the wit of man to say what dream it was Man is but an ass if he go about to expound this dream Methought I was- there is no man can tell what Methought I was and methought I had but man is but a patch'd fool if he will offer to say what methought I had The eye of man hath not heard the ear of man hath not seen man 's hand is not able to taste his tongue to conceive nor his heart to report what my dream was I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of this dream It shall be call'd ' Bottom 's Dream ' because it hath no bottom and I will sing it in the latter end of a play before the Duke Peradventure to make it the more gracious I shall sing it at her death Exit Have you sent to Bottom 's house Is he come home yet He can not be heard of Out of doubt he is transported If he come not then the play is marr'd it goes not forward doth it It is not possible You have not a man in all Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he No he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft man in Athens Yea and the best person too and he is a very paramour for a sweet voice You must say ' paragon ' A paramour is- God bless us!- A thing of naught Masters the Duke is coming from the temple and there is two or three lords and ladies more married If our sport had gone forward we had all been made men O sweet bully Bottom Thus hath he lost sixpence a day during his life he could not have scaped sixpence a day An the Duke had not given him sixpence a day for playing Pyramus I 'll be hanged He would have deserved it sixpence a day in Pyramus or nothing Where are these lads Where are these hearts Bottom O most courageous day O most happy hour Masters I am to discourse wonders but ask me not what for if I tell you I am not true Athenian I will tell you everything right as it fell out Let us hear sweet Bottom Not a word of me All that I will tell you is that the Duke hath dined Get your apparel together good strings to your beards new ribbons to your pumps meet presently at the palace every man look o'er his part for the short and the long is our play is preferr'd In any case let Thisby have clean linen and let not him that plays the lion pare his nails for they shall hang out for the lion 's claws And most dear actors eat no onions nor garlic for we are to utter sweet breath and I do not doubt but to hear them say it is a sweet comedy No more words Away go away Exeunt ' Tis strange my Theseus that these lovers speak of More strange than true I never may believe These antique fables nor these fairy toys Lovers and madmen have such seething brains Such shaping fantasies that apprehend More than cool reason ever comprehends The lunatic the lover and the poet Are of imagination all compact One sees more devils than vast hell can hold That is the madman The lover all as frantic Sees Helen 's beauty in a brow of Egypt The poet 's eye in a fine frenzy rolling Doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown the poet 's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name Such tricks hath strong imagination That if it would but apprehend some joy It comprehends some bringer of that joy Or in the night imagining some fear How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear But all the story of the night told over And all their minds transfigur'd so together More witnesseth than fancy 's images And grows to something of great constancy But howsoever strange and admirable Here come the lovers full of joy and mirth Joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love Accompany your hearts More than to us Wait in your royal walks your board your bed Come now what masques what dances shall we have To wear away this long age of three hours Between our after supper and bed time Where is our usual manager of mirth What revels are in hand Is there no play To ease the anguish of a torturing hour Call Philostrate Here mighty Theseus Say what abridgment have you for this evening What masque what music How shall we beguile The lazy time if not with some delight There is a brief how many sports are ripe Make choice of which your Highness will see first ' The battle with the Centaurs to be sung By an Athenian eunuch to the harp ' We 'll none of that that have I told my love In glory of my kinsman Hercules ' The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage ' That is an old device and it was play'd When I from Thebes came last a conqueror ' The thrice three Muses mourning for the death Of Learning late deceas'd in beggary ' That is some satire keen and critical Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony ' A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus And his love Thisby very tragical mirth ' Merry and tragical tedious and brief That is hot ice and wondrous strange snow How shall we find the concord of this discord A play there is my lord some ten words long Which is as brief as I have known a play But by ten words my lord it is too long Which makes it tedious for in all the play There is not one word apt one player fitted And tragical my noble lord it is For Pyramus therein doth kill himself Which when I saw rehears'd I must confess Made mine eyes water but more merry tears The passion of loud laughter never shed What are they that do play it Hard handed men that work in Athens here Which never labour'd in their minds till now And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories With this same play against your nuptial And we will hear it No my noble lord It is not for you I have heard it over And it is nothing nothing in the world Unless you can find sport in their intents Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain To do you service I will hear that play For never anything can be amiss When simpleness and duty tender it Go bring them in and take your places ladies I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged And duty in his service perishing Why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing He says they can do nothing in this kind The kinder we to give them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be to take what they mistake And what poor duty can not do noble respect Takes it in might not merit Where I have come great clerks have purposed To greet me with premeditated welcomes Where I have seen them shiver and look pale Make periods in the midst of sentences Throttle their practis'd accent in their fears And in conclusion dumbly have broke off Not paying me a welcome Trust me sweet Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome And in the modesty of fearful duty I read as much as from the rattling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence Love therefore and tongue tied simplicity In least speak most to my capacity SO please your Grace the Prologue is address'd Let him approach Flourish of trumpets If we offend it is with our good will That you should think we come not to offend But with good will To show our simple skill That is the true beginning of our end Consider then we come but in despite We do not come as minding to content you Our true intent is All for your delight We are not here That you should here repent you The actors are at band and by their show You shall know all that you are like to know This fellow doth not stand upon points He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop A good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true Indeed he hath play'd on this prologue like a child on a recorder- a sound but not in government His speech was like a tangled chain nothing i m paired but all disordered Who is next Gentles perchance you wonder at this show But wonder on till truth make all things plain This man is Pyramus if you would know This beauteous lady Thisby is certain This man with lime and rough cast doth present Wall that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder And through Walls chink poor souls they are content To whisper At the which let no man wonder This man with lanthorn dog and bush of thorn Presenteth Moonshine for if you will know By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn To meet at Ninus ' tomb there there to woo This grisly beast which Lion hight by name The trusty Thisby coming first by night Did scare away or rather did affright And as she fled her mantle she did fall Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain Anon comes Pyramus sweet youth and tall And finds his trusty Thisby 's mantle slain Whereat with blade with bloody blameful blade He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast And Thisby tarrying in mulberry shade His dagger drew and died For all the rest Let Lion Moonshine Wall and lovers twain At large discourse while here they do remain I wonder if the lion be to speak No wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do In this same interlude it doth befall That I one Snout by name present a wall And such a wall as I would have you think That had in it a crannied hole or chink Through which the lovers Pyramus and Thisby Did whisper often very secretly This loam this rough cast and this stone doth show That I am that same wall the truth is so And this the cranny is right and sinister Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper Would you desire lime and hair to speak better It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard discourse my lord Pyramus draws near the wall silence O grim look'd night O night with hue so black O night which ever art when day is not O night O night alack alack alack I fear my Thisby 's promise is forgot And thou O wall O sweet O lovely wall That stand'st between her father 's ground and mine Thou wall O wall O sweet and lovely wall Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne The wall methinks being sensible should curse again No in truth sir he should not Deceiving me is Thisby 's cue She is to enter now and I am to spy her through the wall You shall see it will fall pat as I told you yonder she comes O wall full often hast thou beard my moans For parting my fair Pyramus and me My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee I see a voice now will I to the chink To spy an I can hear my Thisby 's face Thisby My love thou art my love I think Think what thou wilt I am thy lover 's grace And like Limander am I trusty still And I like Helen till the Fates me kill Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true As Shafalus to Procrus I to you O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall I kiss the wall 's hole not your lips at all Wilt thou at Ninny 's tomb meet me straightway Tide life tide death I come without delay Thus have I Wall my part discharged so And being done thus Wall away doth go Exit WALL Now is the moon used between the two neighbours No remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard The best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them It must be your imagination then and not theirs If we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men Here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion You ladies you whose gentle hearts do fear The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor May now perchance both quake and tremble here When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar Then know that I as Snug the joiner am A lion fell nor else no lion 's dam For if I should as lion come in strife Into this place ' twere pity on my life A very gentle beast and of a good conscience The very best at a beast my lord that e'er I saw This lion is a very fox for his valour True and a goose for his discretion Not so my lord for his valour can not carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose His discretion I am sure can not carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox It is well Leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the Moon This lanthorn doth the horned moon present- He should have worn the horns on his head He is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference This lanthorn doth the horned moon present Myself the Man i ' th ' Moon do seem to be This is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lantern How is it else the man i ' th ' moon He dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff I am aweary of this moon Would he would change It appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time Proceed Moon All that I have to say is to tell you that the lanthorn is the moon I the Man i ' th ' Moon this thorn bush my thorn bush and this dog my dog Why all these should be in the lantern for all these are in the moon But silence here comes Thisby This is old Ninny 's tomb Where is my love Roaring O- THISBY runs off Well roar'd Lion Well run Thisby Well shone Moon Truly the moon shines with a good grace The LION tears THISBY 'S Mantle and exit Well mous'd Lion And then came Pyramus And so the lion vanish'd Sweet Moon I thank thee for thy sunny beams I thank thee Moon for shining now so bright For by thy gracious golden glittering gleams I trust to take of truest Thisby sight This passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad Beshrew my heart but I pity the man O wherefore Nature didst thou lions frame Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear Which is- no no- which was the fairest dame That liv'd that lov'd that lik'd that look'd with cheer No die but an ace for him for he is but one Less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and yet prove an ass How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisby comes back and finds her lover She will find him by starlight Here she comes and her passion ends the play Methinks she should not use a long one for such a Pyramus I hope she will be brief A mote will turn the balance which Pyramus which Thisby is the better- he for a man God warrant us She for a woman God bless us She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes And thus she moans videlicet:- Asleep my love Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead Ay and Wall too Starting up No I assure you the wall is down that parted their fathers Will it please you to see the Epilogue or to hear a Bergomask dance between two of our company No epilogue I pray you for your play needs no excuse Never excuse for when the players are all dead there need none to be blamed Marry if he that writ it had played Pyramus and hang'd himself in Thisby 's garter it would have been a fine tragedy And so it is truly and very notably discharg'd But come your Bergomask let your epilogue alone A dance The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve Lovers to bed ' tis almost fairy time I fear we shall out sleep the coming morn As much as we this night have overwatch'd This palpable gross play hath well beguil'd The heavy gait of night Sweet friends to bed A fortnight hold we this solemnity In nightly revels and new jollity Exeunt Now the hungry lion roars Through the house give glimmering light First rehearse your song by rote Now until the break of day If we shadows have offended Tush never tell me I take it much unkindly That thou Iago who hast had my purse As if the strings were thine shouldst know of this ' Sblood but you will not hear me If ever I did dream of such a matter Abhor me Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate Despise me if I do not Three great ones of the city In personal suit to make me his lieutenant Off capp'd to him and by the faith of man I know my price I am worth no worse a place But he as loving his own pride and purposes Evades them with a bumbast circumstance Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war And in conclusion Nonsuits my mediators for Certes says he I have already chose my officer And what was he Forsooth a great arithmetician One Michael Cassio a Florentine A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife That never set a squadron in the field Nor the division of a battle knows More than a spinster unless the bookish theoric Wherein the toged consuls can propose As masterly as he Mere prattle without practice Is all his soldiership But he sir had the election And I of whom his eyes had seen the proof At Rhodes at Cyprus and on other grounds Christian and heathen must be belee'd and calm'd By debitor and creditor This counter caster He in good time must his lieutenant be And I- God bless the mark!- his Moorship 's ancient By heaven I rather would have been his hangman Why there 's no remedy ' Tis the curse of service Preferment goes by letter and affection And not by old gradation where each second Stood heir to the first Now sir be judge yourself Whether I in any just term am affined To love the Moor I would not follow him then O sir content you I follow him to serve my turn upon him We can not all be masters nor all masters Can not be truly follow'd You shall mark Many a duteous and knee crooking knave That doting on his own obsequious bondage Wears out his time much like his master 's ass For nought but provender and when he 's old cashier'd Whip me such honest knaves Others there are Who trimm'd in forms and visages of duty Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves And throwing but shows of service on their lords Do well thrive by them and when they have lined their coats Do themselves homage These fellows have some soul And such a one do I profess myself For sir It is as sure as you are Roderigo Were I the Moor I would not be Iago In following him I follow but myself Heaven is my judge not I for love and duty But seeming so for my peculiar end For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In complement extern ' tis not long after But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at I am not what I am What a full fortune does the thick lips owe If he can carry't thus Call up her father Rouse him make after him poison his delight Proclaim him in the streets incense her kinsmen And though he in a fertile climate dwell Plague him with flies Though that his joy be joy Yet throw such changes of vexation on't As it may lose some color Here is her father 's house I 'll call aloud Do with like timorous accent and dire yell As when by night and negligence the fire Is spied in populous cities What ho Brabantio Signior Brabantio ho Awake What ho Brabantio Thieves Thieves Thieves Look to your house your daughter and your bags Thieves Thieves What is the reason of this terrible summons What is the matter there Signior is all your family within Are your doors lock'd Why Wherefore ask you this ' Zounds sir you 're robb'd For shame put on your gown Your heart is burst you have lost half your soul Even now now very now an old black ram Is tupping your white ewe Arise arise Awake the snorting citizens with the bell Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you Arise I say What have you lost your wits Most reverend signior do you know my voice Not I. What are you My name is Roderigo The worser welcome I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors In honest plainness thou hast heard me say My daughter is not for thee and now in madness Being full of supper and distempering draughts Upon malicious bravery dost thou come To start my quiet Sir sir sir- But thou must needs be sure My spirit and my place have in them power To make this bitter to thee Patience good sir What tell'st thou me of robbing This is Venice My house is not a grange Most grave Brabantio In simple and pure soul I come to you ' Zounds sir you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil bid you Because we come to do you service and you think we are ruffians you 'll have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse you 'll have your nephews neigh to you you 'll have coursers for cousins and gennets for germans What profane wretch art thou I am one sir that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs Thou are a villain You are- a senator This thou shalt answer I know thee Roderigo Sir I will answer anything But I beseech you If't be your pleasure and most wise consent As partly I find it is that your fair daughter At this odd even and dull watch o ' the night Transported with no worse nor better guard But with a knave of common hire a gondolier To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor- If this be known to you and your allowance We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs But if you know not this my manners tell me We have your wrong rebuke Do not believe That from the sense of all civility I thus would play and trifle with your reverence Your daughter if you have not given her leave I say again hath made a gross revolt Tying her duty beauty wit and fortunes In an extravagant and wheeling stranger Of here and everywhere Straight satisfy yourself If she be in her chamber or your house Let loose on me the justice of the state For thus deluding you Strike on the tinder ho Give me a taper Call up all my people This accident is not unlike my dream Belief of it oppresses me already Light I say light Exit above Farewell for I must leave you It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place To be produced- as if I stay I shall- Against the Moor for I do know the state However this may gall him with some check Can not with safety cast him for he 's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars Which even now stands in act that for their souls Another of his fathom they have none To lead their business in which regard Though I do hate him as I do hell pains Yet for necessity of present life I must show out a flag and sign of love Which is indeed but sign That you shall surely find him Lead to the Sagittary the raised search And there will I be with him So farewell Exit It is too true an evil gone she is And what 's to come of my despised time Is nought but bitterness Now Roderigo Where didst thou see her O unhappy girl With the Moor say'st thou Who would be a father How didst thou know ' twas she O she deceives me Past thought What said she to you Get more tapers Raise all my kindred Are they married think you Truly I think they are O heaven How got she out O treason of the blood Fathers from hence trust not your daughters ' minds By what you see them act Is there not charms By which the property of youth and maidhood May be abused Have you not read Roderigo Of some such thing Yes sir I have indeed Call up my brother O would you had had her Some one way some another Do you know Where we may apprehend her and the Moor I think I can discover him if you please To get good guard and go along with me Pray you lead on At every house I 'll call I may command at most Get weapons ho And raise some special officers of night On good Roderigo I 'll deserve your pains Exeunt Though in the trade of war I have slain men Yet do I hold it very stuff o ' the conscience To do no contrived murther I lack iniquity Sometimes to do me service Nine or ten times I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs ' Tis better as it is Nay but he prated And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms Against your honor That with the little godliness I have I did full hard forbear him But I pray you sir Are you fast married Be assured of this That the magnifico is much beloved And hath in his effect a voice potential As double as the Duke 's He will divorce you Or put upon you what restraint and grievance The law with all his might to enforce it on Will give him cable Let him do his spite My services which I have done the signiory Shall out tongue his complaints ' Tis yet to know- Which when I know that boasting is an honor I shall promulgate- I fetch my life and being From men of royal siege and my demerits May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune As this that I have reach'd For know Iago But that I love the gentle Desdemona I would not my unhoused free condition Put into circumscription and confine For the sea 's worth But look What lights come yond Those are the raised father and his friends You were best go in Not I I must be found My parts my title and my perfect soul Shall manifest me rightly Is it they By Janus I think no The servants of the Duke And my lieutenant The goodness of the night upon you friends What is the news The Duke does greet you general And he requires your haste post haste appearance Even on the instant What is the matter think you Something from Cyprus as I may divine It is a business of some heat The galleys Have sent a dozen sequent messengers This very night at one another 's heels And many of the consuls raised and met Are at the Duke 's already You have been hotly call'd for When being not at your lodging to be found The Senate hath sent about three several quests To search you out ' Tis well I am found by you I will but spend a word here in the house And go with you Exit Ancient what makes he here Faith he tonight hath boarded a land carack If it prove lawful prize he 's made forever I do not understand He 's married To who Marry to- Come captain will you go Have with you Here comes another troop to seek for you It is Brabantio General be advised He comes to bad intent Holla Stand there Signior it is the Moor Down with him thief You Roderigo Come sir I am for you Keep up your bright swords for the dew will rust them Good signior you shall more command with years Than with your weapons O thou foul thief where hast thou stow'd my daughter Damn'd as thou art thou hast enchanted her For I 'll refer me to all things of sense If she in chains of magic were not bound Whether a maid so tender fair and happy So opposite to marriage that she shunn'd The wealthy curled darlings of our nation Would ever have to incur a general mock Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom Of such a thing as thou- to fear not to delight Judge me the world if ' tis not gross in sense That thou hast practiced on her with foul charms Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals That weaken motion I 'll have't disputed on ' Tis probable and palpable to thinking I therefore apprehend and do attach thee For an abuser of the world a practicer Of arts inhibited and out of warrant Lay hold upon him If he do resist Subdue him at his peril Hold your hands Both you of my inclining and the rest Were it my cue to fight I should have known it Without a prompter Where will you that I go To answer this your charge To prison till fit time Of law and course of direct session Call thee to answer What if I do obey How may the Duke be therewith satisfied Whose messengers are here about my side Upon some present business of the state To bring me to him ' Tis true most worthy signior The Duke 's in council and your noble self I am sure is sent for How The Duke in council In this time of the night Bring him away Mine 's not an idle cause The Duke himself Or any of my brothers of the state Can not but feel this wrong as ' twere their own For if such actions may have passage free Bond slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be Exeunt There is no composition in these news That gives them credit Indeed they are disproportion'd My letters say a hundred and seven galleys And mine a hundred and forty And mine two hundred But though they jump not on a just account- As in these cases where the aim reports ' Tis oft with difference- yet do they all confirm A Turkish fleet and bearing up to Cyprus Nay it is possible enough to judgement I do not so secure me in the error But the main article I do approve In fearful sense Within What ho What ho What ho A messenger from the galleys Now what 's the business The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes So was I bid report here to the state By Signior Angelo How say you by this change This can not be By no assay of reason ' tis a pageant To keep us in false gaze When we consider The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk And let ourselves again but understand That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes So may he with more facile question bear it For that it stands not in such warlike brace But altogether lacks the abilities That Rhodes is dress'd in If we make thought of this We must not think the Turk is so unskillful To leave that latest which concerns him first Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain To wake and wage a danger profitless Nay in all confidence he 's not for Rhodes Here is more news The Ottomites reverend and gracious Steering with due course toward the isle of Rhodes Have there injointed them with an after fleet Ay so I thought How many as you guess Of thirty sail and now they do re stem Their backward course bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus Signior Montano Your trusty and most valiant servitor With his free duty recommends you thus And prays you to believe him ' Tis certain then for Cyprus Marcus Luccicos is not he in town He 's now in Florence Write from us to him post post haste dispatch Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor Valiant Othello we must straight employ you Against the general enemy Ottoman To Brabantio I did not see you welcome gentle signior We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight So did I yours Good your Grace pardon me Neither my place nor aught I heard of business Hath raised me from my bed nor doth the general care Take hold on me for my particular grief Is of so flood gate and o'erbearing nature That it engluts and swallows other sorrows And it is still itself Why what 's the matter My daughter O my daughter Dead Ay to me She is abused stol'n from me and corrupted By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks For nature so preposterously to err Being not deficient blind or lame of sense Sans witchcraft could not Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself And you of her the bloody book of law You shall yourself read in the bitter letter After your own sense yea though our proper son Stood in your action Humbly I thank your Grace Here is the man this Moor whom now it seems Your special mandate for the state affairs Hath hither brought We are very sorry for't To Othello What in your own part can you say to this Nothing but this is so Most potent grave and reverend signiors My very noble and approved good masters That I have ta'en away this old man 's daughter It is most true true I have married her The very head and front of my offending Hath this extent no more Rude am I in my speech And little blest with the soft phrase of peace For since these arms of mine had seven years ' pith Till now some nine moons wasted they have used Their dearest action in the tented field And little of this great world can I speak More than pertains to feats of broil and battle And therefore little shall I grace my cause In speaking for myself Yet by your gracious patience I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver Of my whole course of love what drugs what charms What conjuration and what mighty magic- For such proceeding I am charged withal- I won his daughter A maiden never bold Of spirit so still and quiet that her motion Blush'd at herself and she- in spite of nature Of years of country credit everything- To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on It is judgement maim'd and most imperfect That will confess perfection so could err Against all rules of nature and must be driven To find out practices of cunning hell Why this should be I therefore vouch again That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood Or with some dram conjured to this effect He wrought upon her To vouch this is no proof Without more certain and more overt test Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods Of modern seeming do prefer against him But Othello speak Did you by indirect and forced courses Subdue and poison this young maid 's affections Or came it by request and such fair question As soul to soul affordeth I do beseech you Send for the lady to the Sagittary And let her speak of me before her father If you do find me foul in her report The trust the office I do hold of you Not only take away but let your sentence Even fall upon my life Fetch Desdemona hither Ancient conduct them you best know the place Say it Othello Her father loved me oft invited me Still question'd me the story of my life From year to year the battles sieges fortunes That I have pass'd I ran it through even from my boyish days To the very moment that he bade me tell it Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances Of moving accidents by flood and field Of hair breadth ' scapes i ' the imminent deadly breach Of being taken by the insolent foe And sold to slavery of my redemption thence And portance in my travels ' history Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle Rough quarries rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven It was my hint to speak- such was the process- And of the Cannibals that each other eat The Anthropophagi and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders This to hear Would Desdemona seriously incline But still the house affairs would draw her thence Which ever as she could with haste dispatch She'ld come again and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourse which I observing Took once a pliant hour and found good means To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart That I would all my pilgrimage dilate Whereof by parcels she had something heard But not intentively I did consent And often did beguile her of her tears When I did speak of some distressful stroke That my youth suffer'd My story being done She gave me for my pains a world of sighs She swore in faith ' twas strange ' twas passing strange ' Twas pitiful ' twas wondrous pitiful She wish'd she had not heard it yet she wish'd That heaven had made her such a man she thank'd me And bade me if I had a friend that loved her I should but teach him how to tell my story And that would woo her Upon this hint I spake She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd And I loved her that she did pity them This only is the witchcraft I have used Here comes the lady let her witness it I think this tale would win my daughter too Good Brabantio Take up this mangled matter at the best Men do their broken weapons rather use Than their bare hands I pray you hear her speak If she confess that she was half the wooer Destruction on my head if my bad blame Light on the man Come hither gentle mistress Do you perceive in all this noble company Where most you owe obedience My noble father I do perceive here a divided duty To you I am bound for life and education My life and education both do learn me How to respect you you are the lord of duty I am hitherto your daughter But here 's my husband And so much duty as my mother show'd To you preferring you before her father So much I challenge that I may profess Due to the Moor my lord God be with you I have done Please it your Grace on to the state affairs I had rather to adopt a child than get it Come hither Moor I here do give thee that with all my heart Which but thou hast already with all my heart I would keep from thee For your sake jewel I am glad at soul I have no other child For thy escape would teach me tyranny To hang clogs on them I have done my lord Let me speak like yourself and lay a sentence Which as a grise or step may help these lovers Into your favor When remedies are past the griefs are ended By seeing the worst which late on hopes depended To mourn a mischief that is past and gone Is the next way to draw new mischief on What can not be preserved when Fortune takes Patience her injury a mockery makes The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief He robs himself that spends a bootless grief So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile We lose it not so long as we can smile He bears the sentence well that nothing bears But the free comfort which from thence he hears But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow That to pay grief must of poor patience borrow These sentences to sugar or to gall Being strong on both sides are equivocal But words are words I never yet did hear That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear I humbly beseech you proceed to the affairs of state The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for Cyprus Othello the fortitude of the place is best known to you and though we have there a substitute of most allowed sufficiency yet opinion a sovereign mistress of effects throws a more safer voice on you You must therefore be content to slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this more stubborn and boisterous expedition The tyrant custom most grave senators Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war My thrice driven bed of down I do agnize A natural and prompt alacrity I find in hardness and do undertake These present wars against the Ottomites Most humbly therefore bending to your state I crave fit disposition for my wife Due reference of place and exhibition With such accommodation and besort As levels with her breeding If you please Be't at her father 's I 'll not have it so Nor I. Nor I. I would not there reside To put my father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye Most gracious Duke To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear And let me find a charter in your voice To assist my simpleness What would you Desdemona That I did love the Moor to live with him My downright violence and storm of fortunes May trumpet to the world My heart 's subdued Even to the very quality of my lord I saw Othello 's visage in his mind And to his honors and his valiant parts Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate So that dear lords if I be left behind A moth of peace and he go to the war The rites for which I love him are bereft me And I a heavy interim shall support By his dear absence Let me go with him Let her have your voices Vouch with me heaven I therefore beg it not To please the palate of my appetite Nor to comply with heat- the young affects In me defunct- and proper satisfaction But to be free and bounteous to her mind And heaven defend your good souls that you think I will your serious and great business scant For she is with me No when light wing'd toys Of feather'd Cupid seel with wanton dullness My speculative and officed instruments That my disports corrupt and taint my business Let housewives make a skillet of my helm And all indign and base adversities Make head against my estimation Be it as you shall privately determine Either for her stay or going The affair cries haste And speed must answer't you must hence tonight Tonight my lord This night With all my heart At nine i ' the morning here we 'll meet again Othello leave some officer behind And he shall our commission bring to you With such things else of quality and respect As doth import you So please your Grace my ancient A man he is of honesty and trust To his conveyance I assign my wife With what else needful your good Grace shall think To be sent after me Let it be so Good night to everyone To Brabantio And noble signior If virtue no delighted beauty lack Your son in law is far more fair than black Adieu brave Moor use Desdemona well Look to her Moor if thou hast eyes to see She has deceived her father and may thee My life upon her faith Honest Iago My Desdemona must I leave to thee I prithee let thy wife attend on her And bring them after in the best advantage Come Desdemona I have but an hour Of love of worldly matters and direction To spend with thee We must obey the time Iago What say'st thou noble heart What will I do thinkest thou Why go to bed and sleep I will incontinently drown myself If thou dost I shall never love thee after Why thou silly gentleman It is silliness to live when to live is torment and then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician O villainous I have looked upon the world for four times seven years and since I could distinguish betwixt a benefit and an injury I never found man that knew how to love himself Ere I would say I would drown myself for the love of a guinea hen I would change my humanity with a baboon What should I do I confess it is my shame to be so fond but it is not in my virtue to amend it Virtue a fig ' Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus Our bodies are gardens to the which our wills are gardeners so that if we will plant nettles or sow lettuce set hyssop and weed up thyme supply it with one gender of herbs or distract it with many either to have it sterile with idleness or manured with industry why the power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills If the balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of sensuality the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to most preposterous conclusions But we have reason to cool our raging motions our carnal stings our unbitted lusts whereof I take this that you call love to be a sect or scion It can not be It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of the will Come be a man Drown thyself Drown cats and blind puppies I have professed me thy friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of perdurable toughness I could never better stead thee than now Put money in thy purse follow thou the wars defeat thy favor with an usurped beard I say put money in thy purse It can not be that Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor- put money in thy purse- nor he his to her It was a violent commencement and thou shalt see an answerable sequestration- put but money in thy purse These Moors are changeable in their wills- fill thy purse with money The food that to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb as the coloquintida She must change for youth when she is sated with his body she will find the error of her choice She must have change she must therefore put money in thy purse If thou wilt needs damn thyself do it a more delicate way than drowning Make all the money thou canst If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell thou shalt enjoy her- therefore make money A pox of drowning thyself It is clean out of the way Seek thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her Wilt thou be fast to my hopes if I depend on the issue Thou art sure of me- go make money I have told thee often and I retell thee again and again I hate the Moor My cause is hearted thine hath no less reason Let us be conjunctive in our revenge against him If thou canst cuckold him thou dost thyself a pleasure me a sport There are many events in the womb of time which will be delivered Traverse go provide thy money We will have more of this tomorrow Adieu Where shall we meet i ' the morning At my lodging I 'll be with thee betimes Go to farewell Do you hear Roderigo What say you No more of drowning do you hear I am changed I 'll go sell all my land Exit Thus do I ever make my fool my purse For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane If I would time expend with such a snipe But for my sport and profit I hate the Moor And it is thought abroad that ' twixt my sheets He has done my office I know not if't be true But I for mere suspicion in that kind Will do as if for surety He holds me well The better shall my purpose work on him Cassio 's a proper man Let me see now- To get his place and to plume up my will In double knavery- How how?- Let 's see- After some time to abuse Othello 's ear That he is too familiar with his wife He hath a person and a smooth dispose To be suspected- framed to make women false The Moor is of a free and open nature That thinks men honest that but seem to be so And will as tenderly be led by the nose As asses are I have't It is engender'd Hell and night Must bring this monstrous birth to the world 's light What from the cape can you discern at sea Nothing at all It is a high wrought flood I can not ' twixt the heaven and the main Descry a sail Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea What ribs of oak when mountains melt on them Can hold the mortise What shall we hear of this A segregation of the Turkish fleet For do but stand upon the foaming shore The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds The wind shaked surge with high and monstrous mane Seems to cast water on the burning bear And quench the guards of the ever fixed pole I never did like molestation view On the enchafed flood If that the Turkish fleet Be not enshelter'd and embay'd they are drown'd It is impossible to bear it out News lads Our wars are done The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks That their designment halts A noble ship of Venice Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance On most part of their fleet How Is this true The ship is here put in A Veronesa Michael Cassio Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello Is come on shore the Moor himself at sea And is in full commission here for Cyprus I am glad on't ' tis a worthy governor But this same Cassio though he speak of comfort Touching the Turkish loss yet he looks sadly And prays the Moor be safe for they were parted With foul and violent tempest Pray heavens he be For I have served him and the man commands Like a full soldier Let 's to the seaside ho As well to see the vessel that 's come in As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello Even till we make the main and the aerial blue An indistinct regard Come let 's do so For every minute is expectancy Of more arrivance Thanks you the valiant of this warlike isle That so approve the Moor O let the heavens Give him defense against the elements For I have lost him on a dangerous sea I she well shipp'd His bark is stoutly timber'd and his pilot Of very expert and approved allowance Therefore my hopes not surfeited to death Stand in bold cure The town is empty on the brow o ' the sea Stand ranks of people and they cry A sail My hopes do shape him for the governor They do discharge their shot of courtesy- Our friends at least I pray you sir go forth And give us truth who ' tis that is arrived I shall Exit But good lieutenant is your general wived Most fortunately he hath achieved a maid That paragons description and wild fame One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens And in the essential vesture of creation Does tire the ingener ' Tis one Iago ancient to the general He has had most favorable and happy speed Tempests themselves high seas and howling winds The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel As having sense of beauty do omit Their mortal natures letting go safely by The divine Desdemona What is she She that I spake of our great captain 's captain Left in the conduct of the bold Iago Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts A se'nnight 's speed Great Jove Othello guard And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath That he may bless this bay with his tall ship Make love 's quick pants in Desdemona 's arms Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits And bring all Cyprus comfort I thank you valiant Cassio What tidings can you tell me of my lord He is not yet arrived nor know I aught But that he 's well and will be shortly here O but I fear- How lost you company The great contention of the sea and skies Parted our fellowship- But hark a sail They give their greeting to the citadel This likewise is a friend See for the news Sir would she give you so much of her lips As of her tongue she oft bestows on me You'ld have enough Alas she has no speech In faith too much I find it still when I have list to sleep Marry before your ladyship I grant She puts her tongue a little in her heart And chides with thinking You have little cause to say so Come on come on You are pictures out of doors Bells in your parlors wildcats in your kitchens Saints in your injuries devils being offended Players in your housewifery and housewives in your beds O fie upon thee slanderer Nay it is true or else I am a Turk You rise to play and go to bed to work You shall not write my praise No let me not What wouldst thou write of me if thou shouldst praise me O gentle lady do not put me to't For I am nothing if not critical Come on assay- There 's one gone to the harbor Ay madam I am not merry but I do beguile The thing I am by seeming otherwise Come how wouldst thou praise me I am about it but indeed my invention Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frieze It plucks out brains and all But my Muse labors And thus she is deliver'd If she be fair and wise fairness and wit The one 's for use the other useth it Well praised How if she be black and witty If she be black and thereto have a wit She 'll find a white that shall her blackness fit Worse and worse How if fair and foolish She never yet was foolish that was fair For even her folly help'd her to an heir These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i ' the alehouse What miserable praise hast thou for her that 's foul and foolish There 's none so foul and foolish thereunto But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do O heavy ignorance Thou praisest the worst best But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving woman indeed one that in the authority of her merit did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself She that was ever fair and never proud Had tongue at will and yet was never loud Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay Fled from her wish and yet said Now I may She that being anger'd her revenge being nigh Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly She that in wisdom never was so frail To change the cod 's head for the salmon 's tail She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind See suitors following and not look behind She was a wight if ever such wight were- To do what To suckle fools and chronicle small beer O most lame and impotent conclusion Do not learn of him Emilia though he be thy husband How say you Cassio Is he not a most profane and liberal counselor He speaks home madam You may relish him more in the soldier than in the scholar Aside He takes her by the palm ay well said whisper With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as Cassio Ay smile upon her do I will gyve thee in thine own courtship You say true ' tis so indeed If such tricks as these strip you out of your lieutenantry it had been better you had not kissed your three fingers so oft which now again you are most apt to play the sir in Very good Well kissed an excellent courtesy ' tis so indeed Yet again your fingers to your lips Would they were clyster pipes for your sake Trumpet within The Moor I know his trumpet ' Tis truly so Let 's meet him and receive him Lo where he comes O my fair warrior My dear Othello It gives me wonder great as my content To see you here before me O my soul 's joy If after every tempest come such calms May the winds blow till they have waken'd death And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas Olympus high and duck again as low As hell 's from heaven If it were now to die ' Twere now to be most happy for I fear My soul hath her content so absolute That not another comfort like to this Succeeds in unknown fate The heavens forbid But that our loves and comforts should increase Even as our days do grow Amen to that sweet powers I can not speak enough of this content It stops me here it is too much of joy And this and this the greatest discords be Kisses her That e'er our hearts shall make Aside O you are well tuned now But I 'll set down the pegs that make this music As honest as I am Come let us to the castle News friends our wars are done the Turks are drown'd How does my old acquaintance of this isle Honey you shall be well desired in Cyprus I have found great love amongst them O my sweet I prattle out of fashion and I dote In mine own comforts I prithee good Iago Go to the bay and disembark my coffers Bring thou the master to the citadel He is a good one and his worthiness Does challenge much respect Come Desdemona Once more well met at Cyprus Do thou meet me presently at the harbor Come hither If thou be'st valiant- as they say base men being in love have then a nobility in their natures more than is native to them- list me The lieutenant tonight watches on the court of guard First I must tell thee this Desdemona is directly in love with him With him Why ' tis not possible Lay thy finger thus and let thy soul be instructed Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies And will she love him still for prating Let not thy discreet heart think it Her eye must be fed and what delight shall she have to look on the devil When the blood is made dull with the act of sport there should be again to inflame it and to give satiety a fresh appetite loveliness in favor sympathy in years manners and beauties- all which the Moor is defective in Now for want of these required conveniences her delicate tenderness will find itself abused begin to heave the gorge disrelish and abhor the Moor very nature will instruct her in it and compel her to some second choice Now sir this granted- as it is a most pregnant and unforced position- who stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does A knave very voluble no further conscionable than in putting on the mere form of civil and humane seeming for the better compass of his salt and most hidden loose affection Why none why none- a slipper and subtle knave a finder out of occasions that has an eye can stamp and counterfeit advantages though true advantage never present itself- a devilish knave Besides the knave is handsome young and hath all those requisites in him that folly and green minds look after- a pestilent complete knave and the woman hath found him already I can not believe that in her she 's full of most blest condition Blest fig's end The wine she drinks is made of grapes If she had been blest she would never have loved the Moor Blest pudding Didst thou not see her paddle with the palm of his hand Didst not mark that Yes that I did but that was but courtesy Lechery by this hand an index and obscure prologue to the history of lust and foul thoughts They met so near with their lips that their breaths embraced together Villainous thoughts Roderigo When these mutualities so marshal the way hard at hand comes the master and main exercise the incorporate conclusion Pish But sir be you ruled by me I have brought you from Venice Watch you tonight for the command I 'll lay't upon you Cassio knows you not I 'll not be far from you Do you find some occasion to anger Cassio either by speaking too loud or tainting his discipline or from what other course you please which the time shall more favorably minister Well Sir he is rash and very sudden in choler and haply may strike at you Provoke him that he may for even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to mutiny whose qualification shall come into no true taste again but by the displanting of Cassio So shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by the means I shall then have to prefer them and the impediment most profitably removed without the which there were no expectation of our prosperity I will do this if I can bring it to any opportunity I warrant thee Meet me by and by at the citadel I must fetch his necessaries ashore Farewell Adieu Exit That Cassio loves her I do well believe it That she loves him ' tis apt and of great credit The Moor howbeit that I endure him not Is of a constant loving noble nature And I dare think he 'll prove to Desdemona A most dear husband Now I do love her too Not out of absolute lust though peradventure I stand accountant for as great a sin But partly led to diet my revenge For that I do suspect the lusty Moor Hath leap'd into my seat the thought whereof Doth like a poisonous mineral gnaw my inwards And nothing can or shall content my soul Till I am even'd with him wife for wife Or failing so yet that I put the Moor At least into a jealousy so strong That judgement can not cure Which thing to do If this poor trash of Venice whom I trace For his quick hunting stand the putting on I 'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb For I fear Cassio with my nightcap too Make the Moor thank me love me and reward me For making him egregiously an ass And practicing upon his peace and quiet Even to madness ' Tis here but yet confused Knavery 's plain face is never seen till used Exit It is Othello 's pleasure our noble and valiant general that upon certain tidings now arrived importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet every man put himself into triumph some to dance some to make bonfires each man to what sport and revels his addiction leads him for besides these beneficial news it is the celebration of his nuptial So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed All offices are open and there is full liberty of feasting from this present hour of five till the bell have told eleven Heaven bless the isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello Exeunt Good Michael look you to the guard tonight Let 's teach ourselves that honorable stop Not to outsport discretion Iago hath direction what to do But notwithstanding with my personal eye Will I look to't Iago is most honest Michael good night Tomorrow with your earliest Let me have speech with you Come my dear love The purchase made the fruits are to ensue That profit 's yet to come ' tween me and you Good night Welcome Iago we must to the watch Not this hour lieutenant ' tis not yet ten o ' the clock Our general cast us thus early for the love of his Desdemona who let us not therefore blame He hath not yet made wanton the night with her and she is sport for Jove She 's a most exquisite lady And I 'll warrant her full of game Indeed she 's a most fresh and delicate creature What an eye she has Methinks it sounds a parley to provocation An inviting eye and yet methinks right modest And when she speaks is it not an alarum to love She is indeed perfection Well happiness to their sheets Come lieutenant I have a stope of wine and here without are a brace of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to the health of black Othello Not tonight good Iago I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking I could well wish courtesy would invent some other custom of entertainment O they are our friends But one cup I 'll drink for you I have drunk but one cup tonight and that was craftily qualified too and behold what innovation it makes here I am unfortunate in the infirmity and dare not task my weakness with any more What man ' Tis a night of revels the gallants desire it Where are they Here at the door I pray you call them in I 'll do't but it dislikes me Exit If I can fasten but one cup upon him With that which he hath drunk tonight already He 'll be as full of quarrel and offense As my young mistress ' dog Now my sick fool Roderigo Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out To Desdemona hath tonight caroused Potations pottle deep and he 's to watch Three lads of Cyprus noble swelling spirits That hold their honors in a wary distance The very elements of this warlike isle Have I tonight fluster'd with flowing cups And they watch too Now ' mongst this flock of drunkards Am I to put our Cassio in some action That may offend the isle But here they come If consequence do but approve my dream My boat sails freely both with wind and stream ' Fore God they have given me a rouse already Good faith a little one not past a pint as I am a soldier Some wine ho ' Fore God an excellent song I learned it in England where indeed they are most potent in potting Your Dane your German and your swag bellied Hollander- Drink ho!- are nothing to your English Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking Why he drinks you with facility your Dane dead drunk he sweats not to overthrow your Almain he gives your Hollander a vomit ere the next pottle can be filled To the health of our general I am for it lieutenant and I 'll do you justice O sweet England Why this is a more exquisite song than the other Will you hear't again No for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that does those things Well God 's above all and there be souls must be saved and there be souls must not be saved It 's true good lieutenant For mine own part- no offense to the general nor any man of quality- I hope to be saved And so do I too lieutenant Ay but by your leave not before me the lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient Let 's have no more of this let 's to our affairs God forgive us our sins Gentlemen let 's look to our business Do not think gentlemen I am drunk this is my ancient this is my right hand and this is my left I am not drunk now I can stand well enough and I speak well enough Excellent well Why very well then you must not think then that I am drunk Exit To the platform masters come let 's set the watch You see this fellow that is gone before He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar And give direction And do but see his vice ' Tis to his virtue a just equinox The one as long as the other ' Tis pity of him I fear the trust Othello puts him in On some odd time of his infirmity Will shake this island But is he often thus ' Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep He 'll watch the horologe a double set If drink rock not his cradle It were well The general were put in mind of it Perhaps he sees it not or his good nature Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio And looks not on his evils Is not this true Aside to him How now Roderigo I pray you after the lieutenant go Exit Roderigo And ' tis great pity that the noble Moor Should hazard such a place as his own second With one of an ingraft infirmity It were an honest action to say So to the Moor Not I for this fair island I do love Cassio well and would do much To cure him of this evil- But hark What noise ' Zounds You rogue You rascal What 's the matter lieutenant A knave teach me my duty But I 'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle Beat me Dost thou prate rogue Strikes Roderigo Nay good lieutenant I pray you sir hold your hand Let me go sir or I 'll knock you o'er the mazzard Come come you 're drunk Drunk They fight Aside to Roderigo Away I say go out and cry a mutiny What is the matter here ' Zounds I bleed still I am hurt to the death Hold for your lives Hold ho Lieutenant- sir- Montano- gentlemen- Have you forgot all place of sense and duty Hold the general speaks to you Hold hold for shame Why how now ho from whence ariseth this Are we turn'd Turks and to ourselves do that Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites For Christian shame put by this barbarous brawl He that stirs next to carve for his own rage Holds his soul light he dies upon his motion Silence that dreadful bell it frights the isle From her propriety What is the matter masters Honest Iago that look'st dead with grieving Speak who began this On thy love I charge thee I do not know Friends all but now even now In quarter and in terms like bride and groom Devesting them for bed and then but now As if some planet had unwitted men Swords out and tilting one at other 's breast In opposition bloody I can not speak Any beginning to this peevish odds And would in action glorious I had lost Those legs that brought me to a part of it How comes it Michael you are thus forgot I pray you pardon me I can not speak Worthy Montano you were wo nt be civil The gravity and stillness of your youth The world hath noted and your name is great In mouths of wisest censure What 's the matter That you unlace your reputation thus And spend your rich opinion for the name Of a night brawler Give me answer to it Worthy Othello I am hurt to danger Your officer Iago can inform you- While I spare speech which something now offends me- Of all that I do know Nor know I aught By me that 's said or done amiss this night Unless self charity be sometimes a vice And to defend ourselves it be a sin When violence assails us Now by heaven My blood begins my safer guides to rule And passion having my best judgement collied Assays to lead the way If I once stir Or do but lift this arm the best of you Shall sink in my rebuke Give me to know How this foul rout began who set it on And he that is approved in this offense Though he had twinn'd with me both at a birth Shall lose me What in a town of war Yet wild the people 's hearts brimful of fear To manage private and domestic quarrel In night and on the court and guard of safety ' Tis monstrous Iago who began't If partially affined or leagued in office Thou dost deliver more or less than truth Thou art no soldier Touch me not so near I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth Than it should do offense to Michael Cassio Yet I persuade myself to speak the truth Shall nothing wrong him Thus it is general Montano and myself being in speech There comes a fellow crying out for help And Cassio following him with determined sword To execute upon him Sir this gentleman Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause Myself the crying fellow did pursue Lest by his clamor- as it so fell out- The town might fall in fright He swift of foot Outran my purpose and I return'd the rather For that I heard the clink and fall of swords And Cassio high in oath which till tonight I ne'er might say before When I came back- For this was brief- I found them close together At blow and thrust even as again they were When you yourself did part them More of this matter can not I report But men are men the best sometimes forget Though Cassio did some little wrong to him As men in rage strike those that wish them best Yet surely Cassio I believe received From him that fled some strange indignity Which patience could not pass I know Iago Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter Making it light to Cassio Cassio I love thee But never more be officer of mine What 's the matter All 's well now sweeting come away to bed Sir for your hurts myself will be your surgeon Lead him off Exit Montano attended Iago look with care about the town And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted Come Desdemona ' tis the soldiers ' life To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife What are you hurt lieutenant Ay past all surgery Marry heaven forbid Reputation reputation reputation O I have lost my reputation I have lost the immortal part of myself and what remains is bestial My reputation Iago my reputation As I am an honest man I thought you had received some bodily wound there is more sense in that than in reputation Reputation is an idle and most false imposition oft got without merit and lost without deserving You have lost no reputation at all unless you repute yourself such a loser What man there are ways to recover the general again You are but now cast in his mood a punishment more in policy than in malice even so as one would beat his offenseless dog to affright an imperious lion Sue to him again and he 's yours I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a commander with so slight so drunken and so indiscreet an officer Drunk and speak parrot and squabble swagger swear and discourse fustian with one 's own shadow O thou invisible spirit of wine if thou hast no name to be known by let us call thee devil What was he that you followed with your sword What had he done to you I know not Is't possible I remember a mass of things but nothing distinctly a quarrel but nothing wherefore O God that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains that we should with joy pleasance revel and applause transform ourselves into beasts Why but you are now well enough How came you thus It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place to the devil wrath one unperfectness shows me another to make me frankly despise myself Come you are too severe a moraler As the time the place and the condition of this country stands I could heartily wish this had not befallen but since it is as it is mend it for your own good I will ask him for my place again he shall tell me I am a drunkard Had I as many mouths as Hydra such an answer would stop them all To be now a sensible man by and by a fool and presently a beast O strange Every inordinate cup is unblest and the ingredient is a devil Come come good wine is a good familiar creature if it be well used Exclaim no more against it And good lieutenant I think you think I love you I have well approved it sir I drunk You or any man living may be drunk at some time man I 'll tell you what you shall do Our general 's wife is now the general I may say so in this respect for that he hath devoted and given up himself to the contemplation mark and denotement of her parts and graces Confess yourself freely to her importune her help to put you in your place again She is of so free so kind so apt so blessed a disposition she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more than she is requested This broken joint between you and her husband entreat her to splinter and my fortunes against any lay worth naming this crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before You advise me well I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness I think it freely and betimes in the morning I will beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me I am desperate of my fortunes if they check me here You are in the right Good night lieutenant I must to the watch Good night honest Iago Exit And what 's he then that says I play the villain When this advice is free I give and honest Probal to thinking and indeed the course To win the Moor again For ' tis most easy The inclining Desdemona to subdue In any honest suit She 's framed as fruitful As the free elements And then for her To win the Moor were't to renounce his baptism All seals and symbols of redeemed sin His soul is so enfetter'd to her love That she may make unmake do what she list Even as her appetite shall play the god With his weak function How am I then a villain To counsel Cassio to this parallel course Directly to his good Divinity of hell When devils will the blackest sins put on They do suggest at first with heavenly shows As I do now For whiles this honest fool Plies Desdemona to repair his fortune And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor I 'll pour this pestilence into his ear That she repeals him for her body 's lust And by how much she strives to do him good She shall undo her credit with the Moor So will I turn her virtue into pitch And out of her own goodness make the net That shall enmesh them all I do follow here in the chase not like a hound that hunts but one that fills up the cry My money is almost spent I have been tonight exceedingly well cudgeled and I think the issue will be I shall have so much experience for my pains and so with no money at all and a little more wit return again to Venice How poor are they that have not patience What wound did ever heal but by degrees Thou know'st we work by wit and not by witchcraft And wit depends on dilatory time Does't not go well Cassio hath beaten thee And thou by that small hurt hast cashier'd Cassio Though other things grow fair against the sun Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe Content thyself awhile By the mass ' tis morning Pleasure and action make the hours seem short Retire thee go where thou art billeted Away I say Thou shalt know more hereafter Nay get thee gone Exit Roderigo Two things are to be done My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress- I 'll set her on Myself the while to draw the Moor apart And bring him jump when he may Cassio find Soliciting his wife Ay that 's the way Dull not device by coldness and delay Exit Masters play here I will content your pains Something that 's brief and bid Good morrow general Music Why masters have your instruments been in Naples that they speak i ' the nose thus How sir how Are these I pray you wind instruments Ay marry are they sir O thereby hangs a tail Whereby hangs a tale sir Marry sir by many a wind instrument that I know But masters here 's money for you and the general so likes your music that he desires you for love 's sake to make no more noise with it Well sir we will not If you have any music that may not be heard to't again but as they say to hear music the general does not greatly care We have none such sir Then put up your pipes in your bag for I 'll away Go vanish into air away Exeunt Musicians Dost thou hear my honest friend No I hear not your honest friend I hear you Prithee keep up thy quillets There 's a poor piece of gold for thee If the gentlewoman that attends the general 's wife be stirring tell her there 's one Cassio entreats her a little favor of speech Wilt thou do this She is stirring sir If she will stir hither I shall seem to notify unto her Do good my friend Exit Clown You have not been abed then Why no the day had broke Before we parted I have made bold Iago To send in to your wife My suit to her Is that she will to virtuous Desdemona Procure me some access I 'll send her to you presently And I 'll devise a mean to draw the Moor Out of the way that your converse and business May be more free I humbly thank you for't Exit Iago I never knew A Florentine more kind and honest Good morrow good lieutenant I am sorry For your displeasure but all will sure be well The general and his wife are talking of it And she speaks for you stoutly The Moor replies That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus And great affinity and that in wholesome wisdom He might not but refuse you but he protests he loves you And needs no other suitor but his likings To take the safest occasion by the front To bring you in again Yet I beseech you If you think fit or that it may be done Give me advantage of some brief discourse With Desdemona alone Pray you come in I will bestow you where you shall have time To speak your bosom freely I am much bound to you These letters give Iago to the pilot And by him do my duties to the Senate That done I will be walking on the works Repair there to me Well my good lord I 'll do't This fortification gentlemen shall we see't We 'll wait upon your lordship Exeunt Be thou assured good Cassio I will do All my abilities in thy behalf Good madam do I warrant it grieves my husband As if the cause were his O that 's an honest fellow Do not doubt Cassio But I will have my lord and you again As friendly as you were Bounteous madam Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio He 's never anything but your true servant I know't I thank you You do love my lord You have known him long and be you well assured He shall in strangeness stand no farther off Than in a politic distance Ay but lady That policy may either last so long Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet Or breed itself so out of circumstances That I being absent and my place supplied My general will forget my love and service Do not doubt that Before Emilia here I give thee warrant of thy place assure thee If I do vow a friendship I 'll perform it To the last article My lord shall never rest I 'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience His bed shall seem a school his board a shrift I 'll intermingle everything he does With Cassio 's suit Therefore be merry Cassio For thy solicitor shall rather die Than give thy cause away Madam here comes my lord Madam I 'll take my leave Nay stay and hear me speak Madam not now I am very ill at ease Unfit for mine own purposes Well do your discretion Exit Cassio Ha I like not that What dost thou say Nothing my lord or if- I know not what Was not that Cassio parted from my wife Cassio my lord No sure I can not think it That he would steal away so guilty like Seeing you coming I do believe ' twas he How now my lord I have been talking with a suitor here A man that languishes in your displeasure Who is't you mean Why your lieutenant Cassio Good my lord If I have any grace or power to move you His present reconciliation take For if he be not one that truly loves you That errs in ignorance and not in cunning I have no judgement in an honest face I prithee call him back Went he hence now Ay sooth so humbled That he hath left part of his grief with me To suffer with him Good love call him back Not now sweet Desdemona some other time But shall't be shortly The sooner sweet for you Shall't be tonight at supper No not tonight Tomorrow dinner then I shall not dine at home I meet the captains at the citadel Why then tomorrow night or Tuesday morn On Tuesday noon or night on Wednesday morn I prithee name the time but let it not Exceed three days In faith he 's penitent And yet his trespass in our common reason- Save that they say the wars must make example Out of their best- is not almost a fault To incur a private check When shall he come Tell me Othello I wonder in my soul What you would ask me that I should deny Or stand so mammering on What Michael Cassio That came awooing with you and so many a time When I have spoke of you dispraisingly Hath ta'en your part- to have so much to do To bring him in Trust me I could do much- Prithee no more Let him come when he will I will deny thee nothing Why this is not a boon ' Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves Or feed on nourishing dishes or keep you warm Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit To your own person Nay when I have a suit Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed It shall be full of poise and difficult weight And fearful to be granted I will deny thee nothing Whereon I do beseech thee grant me this To leave me but a little to myself Shall I deny you No Farewell my lord Farewell my Desdemona I 'll come to thee straight Emilia come Be as your fancies teach you Whate'er you be I am obedient Excellent wretch Perdition catch my soul But I do love thee and when I love thee not Chaos is come again My noble lord- What dost thou say Iago Did Michael Cassio when you woo'd my lady Know of your love He did from first to last Why dost thou ask But for a satisfaction of my thought No further harm Why of thy thought Iago I did not think he had been acquainted with her O yes and went between us very oft Indeed Indeed ay indeed Discern'st thou aught in that Is he not honest Honest my lord Honest Ay honest My lord for aught I know What dost thou think Think my lord Think my lord By heaven he echoes me As if there were some monster in his thought Too hideous to be shown Thou dost mean something I heard thee say even now thou like'st not that When Cassio left my wife What didst not like And when I told thee he was of my counsel In my whole course of wooing thou criedst Indeed And didst contract and purse thy brow together As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain Some horrible conceit If thou dost love me Show me thy thought My lord you know I love you I think thou dost And for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more For such things in a false disloyal knave Are tricks of custom but in a man that 's just They 're close dilations working from the heart That passion can not rule For Michael Cassio I dare be sworn I think that he is honest I think so too Men should be what they seem Or those that be not would they might seem none Certain men should be what they seem Why then I think Cassio 's an honest man Nay yet there 's more in this I prithee speak to me as to thy thinkings As thou dost ruminate and give thy worst of thoughts The worst of words Good my lord pardon me Though I am bound to every act of duty I am not bound to that all slaves are free to Utter my thoughts Why say they are vile and false As where 's that palace whereinto foul things Sometimes intrude not Who has a breast so pure But some uncleanly apprehensions Keep leets and law days and in session sit With meditations lawful Thou dost conspire against thy friend Iago If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear A stranger to thy thoughts I do beseech you- Though I perchance am vicious in my guess As I confess it is my nature 's plague To spy into abuses and oft my jealousy Shapes faults that are not- that your wisdom yet From one that so imperfectly conceits Would take no notice nor build yourself a trouble Out of his scattering and unsure observance It were not for your quiet nor your good Nor for my manhood honesty or wisdom To let you know my thoughts What dost thou mean Good name in man and woman dear my lord Is the immediate jewel of their souls Who steals my purse steals trash ' tis something nothing ' Twas mine ' tis his and has been slave to thousands But he that filches from me my good name Robs me of that which not enriches him And makes me poor indeed By heaven I 'll know thy thoughts You can not if my heart were in your hand Nor shall not whilst ' tis in my custody Ha O beware my lord of jealousy It is the green eyed monster which doth mock The meat it feeds on That cuckold lives in bliss Who certain of his fate loves not his wronger But O what damned minutes tells he o'er Who dotes yet doubts suspects yet strongly loves O misery Poor and content is rich and rich enough But riches fineless is as poor as winter To him that ever fears he shall be poor Good heaven the souls of all my tribe defend From jealousy Why why is this Think'st thou I'ld make a life of jealousy To follow still the changes of the moon With fresh suspicions No To be once in doubt Is once to be resolved Exchange me for a goat When I shall turn the business of my soul To such exsufflicate and blown surmises Matching thy inference ' Tis not to make me jealous To say my wife is fair feeds well loves company Is free of speech sings plays and dances well Where virtue is these are more virtuous Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt For she had eyes and chose me No Iago I 'll see before I doubt when I doubt prove And on the proof there is no more but this- Away at once with love or jealousy I am glad of it for now I shall have reason To show the love and duty that I bear you With franker spirit Therefore as I am bound Receive it from me I speak not yet of proof Look to your wife observe her well with Cassio Wear your eye thus not jealous nor secure I would not have your free and noble nature Out of self bounty be abused Look to't I know our country disposition well In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks They dare not show their husbands their best conscience Is not to leave't undone but keep't unknown Dost thou say so She did deceive her father marrying you And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks She loved them most And so she did Why go to then She that so young could give out such a seeming To seel her father 's eyes up close as oak- He thought ' twas witchcraft- but I am much to blame I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much loving you I am bound to thee forever I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits Not a jot not a jot I'faith I fear it has I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from my love But I do see you 're moved I am to pray you not to strain my speech To grosser issues nor to larger reach Than to suspicion I will not Should you do so my lord My speech should fall into such vile success Which my thoughts aim not at Cassio 's my worthy friend- My lord I see you 're moved No not much moved I do not think but Desdemona 's honest Long live she so and long live you to think so And yet how nature erring from itself- Ay there 's the point as- to be bold with you- Not to affect many proposed matches Of her own clime complexion and degree Whereto we see in all things nature tends- Foh one may smell in such a will most rank Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural But pardon me I do not in position Distinctly speak of her though I may fear Her will recoiling to her better judgement May fall to match you with her country forms And happily repent Farewell farewell If more thou dost perceive let me know more Set on thy wife to observe Leave me Iago Going My lord I take my leave Why did I marry This honest creature doubtless Sees and knows more much more than he unfolds Returning My lord I would I might entreat your honor To scan this thing no further leave it to time Though it be fit that Cassio have his place For sure he fills it up with great ability Yet if you please to hold him off awhile You shall by that perceive him and his means Note if your lady strain his entertainment With any strong or vehement importunity Much will be seen in that In the meantime Let me be thought too busy in my fears- As worthy cause I have to fear I am- And hold her free I do beseech your honor Fear not my government I once more take my leave Exit This fellow 's of exceeding honesty And knows all qualities with a learned spirit Of human dealings If I do prove her haggard Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind To prey at fortune Haply for I am black And have not those soft parts of conversation That chamberers have or for I am declined Into the vale of years- yet that 's not much- She 's gone I am abused and my relief Must be to loathe her O curse of marriage That we can call these delicate creatures ours And not their appetites I had rather be a toad And live upon the vapor of a dungeon Than keep a corner in the thing I love For others ' uses Yet ' tis the plague of great ones Prerogatived are they less than the base ' Tis destiny unshunnable like death Even then this forked plague is fated to us When we do quicken Desdemona comes How now my dear Othello Your dinner and the generous islanders By you invited do attend your presence I am to blame Why do you speak so faintly Are you not well I have a pain upon my forehead here Faith that 's with watching ' twill away again Let me but bind it hard within this hour It will be well Your napkin is too little I am very sorry that you are not well I am glad I have found this napkin This was her first remembrance from the Moor My wayward husband hath a hundred times Woo'd me to steal it but she so loves the token For he conjured her she should ever keep it That she reserves it evermore about her To kiss and talk to I 'll have the work ta'en out And give't Iago What he will do with it Heaven knows not I I nothing but to please his fantasy How now what do you here alone Do not you chide I have a thing for you A thing for me It is a common thing- Ha To have a foolish wife O is that all What will you give me now For that same handkerchief What handkerchief What handkerchief Why that the Moor first gave to Desdemona That which so often you did bid me steal Hast stol'n it from her No faith she let it drop by negligence And to the advantage I being here took't up Look here it is A good wench give it me What will you do with't that you have been so earnest To have me filch it Snatching it Why what is that to you If't be not for some purpose of import Give't me again Poor lady she 'll run mad When she shall lack it Be not acknown on't I have use for it Go leave me Exit Emilia I will in Cassio 's lodging lose this napkin And let him find it Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmations strong As proofs of holy writ this may do something The Moor already changes with my poison Dangerous conceits are in their natures poisons Which at the first are scarce found to distaste But with a little act upon the blood Burn like the mines of sulphur I did say so Look where he comes Ha ha false to me Why how now general No more of that Avaunt be gone Thou hast set me on the rack I swear ' tis better to be much abused Than but to know't a little How now my lord What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust I saw't not thought it not it harm'd not me I slept the next night well was free and merry I found not Cassio 's kisses on her lips He that is robb'd not wanting what is stol'n Let him not know't and he 's not robb'd at all I am sorry to hear this I had been happy if the general camp Pioners and all had tasted her sweet body So I had nothing known O now forever Farewell the tranquil mind Farewell content Farewell the plumed troop and the big wars That make ambition virtue O farewell Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump The spirit stirring drum the ear piercing fife The royal banner and all quality Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious war And O you mortal engines whose rude throats The immortal Jove 's dread clamors counterfeit Farewell Othello 's occupation 's gone Is't possible my lord Villain be sure thou prove my love a whore Be sure of it Give me the ocular proof Or by the worth of man 's eternal soul Thou hadst been better have been born a dog Than answer my waked wrath Is't come to this Make me to see't or at the least so prove it That the probation bear no hinge nor loop To hang a doubt on or woe upon thy life My noble lord- If thou dost slander her and torture me Never pray more abandon all remorse On horror 's head horrors accumulate Do deeds to make heaven weep all earth amazed For nothing canst thou to damnation add Greater than that O grace O heaven defend me Are you a man have you a soul or sense God be wi ' you take mine office O wretched fool That livest to make thine honesty a vice O monstrous world Take note take note O world To be direct and honest is not safe I thank you for this profit and from hence I 'll love no friend sith love breeds such offense Nay stay thou shouldst be honest I should be wise for honesty 's a fool And loses that it works for By the world I think my wife be honest and think she is not I think that thou art just and think thou art not I 'll have some proof Her name that was as fresh As Dian 's visage is now begrimed and black As mine own face If there be cords or knives Poison or fire or suffocating streams I 'll not endure it Would I were satisfied I see sir you are eaten up with passion I do repent me that I put it to you You would be satisfied Would Nay I will And may But how how satisfied my lord Would you the supervisor grossly gape on Behold her topp'd Death and damnation O It were a tedious difficulty I think To bring them to that prospect Damn them then If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster More than their own What then how then What shall I say Where 's satisfaction It is impossible you should see this Were they as prime as goats as hot as monkeys As salt as wolves in pride and fools as gross As ignorance made drunk But yet I say If imputation and strong circumstances Which lead directly to the door of truth Will give you satisfaction you may have't Give me a living reason she 's disloyal I do not like the office But sith I am enter'd in this cause so far Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love I will go on I lay with Cassio lately And being troubled with a raging tooth I could not sleep There are a kind of men so loose of soul That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs One of this kind is Cassio In sleep I heard him say Sweet Desdemona Let us be wary let us hide our loves And then sir would he gripe and wring my hand Cry O sweet creature and then kiss me hard As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots That grew upon my lips then laid his leg Over my thigh and sigh'd and kiss'd and then Cried Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor O monstrous monstrous Nay this was but his dream But this denoted a foregone conclusion ' Tis a shrewd doubt though it be but a dream And this may help to thicken other proofs That do demonstrate thinly I 'll tear her all to pieces Nay but be wise yet we see nothing done She may be honest yet Tell me but this Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief Spotted with strawberries in your wife 's hand I gave her such a one ' twas my first gift I know not that but such a handkerchief- I am sure it was your wife's- did I today See Cassio wipe his beard with If it be that- If it be that or any that was hers It speaks against her with the other proofs O that the slave had forty thousand lives One is too poor too weak for my revenge Now do I see ' tis true Look here Iago All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven ' Tis gone Arise black vengeance from thy hollow hell Yield up O love thy crown and hearted throne To tyrannous hate Swell bosom with thy fraught For ' tis of aspics ' tongues Yet be content O blood blood blood Patience I say your mind perhaps may change Never Iago Like to the Pontic Sea Whose icy current and compulsive course Ne'er feels retiring ebb but keeps due on To the Propontic and the Hellespont Even so my bloody thoughts with violent pace Shall ne'er look back ne'er ebb to humble love Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up Now by yond marble heaven In the due reverence of a sacred vow Kneels I here engage my words Do not rise yet Kneels Witness you ever burning lights above You elements that clip us round about Witness that here Iago doth give up The execution of his wit hands heart To wrong'd Othello 's service Let him command And to obey shall be in me remorse What bloody business ever They rise I greet thy love Not with vain thanks but with acceptance bounteous And will upon the instant put thee to't Within these three days let me hear thee say That Cassio 's not alive My friend is dead ' tis done at your request But let her live Damn her lewd minx O damn her Come go with me apart I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift means of death For the fair devil Now art thou my lieutenant I am your own forever Exeunt Do you know sirrah where Lieutenant Cassio lies I dare not say he lies anywhere Why man He 's a soldier and for one to say a soldier lies is stabbing Go to Where lodges he To tell you where he lodges is to tell you where I lie Can anything be made of this I know not where he lodges and for me to devise a lodging and say he lies here or he lies there were to lie in mine own throat Can you inquire him out and be edified by report I will catechize the world for him that is make questions and by them answer Seek him bid him come hither Tell him I have moved my lord on his behalf and hope all will be well To do this is within the compass of man 's wit and therefore I will attempt the doing it Exit Where should I lose that handkerchief Emilia I know not madam Believe me I had rather have lost my purse Full of crusadoes and but my noble Moor Is true of mind and made of no such baseness As jealous creatures are it were enough To put him to ill thinking Is he not jealous Who he I think the sun where he was born Drew all such humors from him Look where he comes I will not leave him now till Cassio Be call'd to him Well my good lady Aside O hardness to dissemble How do you Desdemona Well my good lord Give me your hand This hand is moist my lady It yet has felt no age nor known no sorrow This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart Hot hot and moist This hand of yours requires A sequester from liberty fasting and prayer Much castigation exercise devout For here 's a young and sweating devil here That commonly rebels ' Tis a good hand A frank one You may indeed say so For ' twas that hand that gave away my heart A liberal hand The hearts of old gave hands But our new heraldry is hands not hearts I can not speak of this Come now your promise What promise chuck I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me Lend me thy handkerchief Here my lord That which I gave you I have it not about me Not No faith my lord That 's a fault That handkerchief Did an Egyptian to my mother give She was a charmer and could almost read The thoughts of people She told her while she kept it ' Twould make her amiable and subdue my father Entirely to her love but if she lost it Or made a gift of it my father 's eye Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt After new fancies She dying gave it me And bid me when my fate would have me wive To give it her I did so and take heed on't Make it a darling like your precious eye To lose't or give't away were such perdition As nothing else could match Is't possible ' Tis true there 's magic in the web of it A sibyl that had number'd in the world The sun to course two hundred compasses In her prophetic fury sew'd the work The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk And it was dyed in mummy which the skillful Conserved of maiden 's hearts Indeed is't true Most veritable therefore look to't well Then would to God that I had never seen't Ha wherefore Why do you speak so startingly and rash Is't lost is't gone speak is it out o ' the way Heaven bless us Say you It is not lost but what an if it were How I say it is not lost Fetch't let me see it Why so I can sir but I will not now This is a trick to put me from my suit Pray you let Cassio be received again Fetch me the handkerchief my mind misgives Come come You 'll never meet a more sufficient man The handkerchief I pray talk me of Cassio The handkerchief A man that all his time Hath founded his good fortunes on your love Shared dangers with you- The handkerchief In sooth you are to blame Away Exit Is not this man jealous I ne'er saw this before Sure there 's some wonder in this handkerchief I am most unhappy in the loss of it ' Tis not a year or two shows us a man They are all but stomachs and we all but food They eat us hungerly and when they are full They belch us Look you Cassio and my husband There is no other way ' tis she must do't And lo the happiness Go and importune her How now good Cassio What 's the news with you Madam my former suit I do beseech you That by your virtuous means I may again Exist and be a member of his love Whom I with all the office of my heart Entirely honor I would not be delay'd If my offense be of such mortal kind That nor my service past nor present sorrows Nor purposed merit in futurity Can ransom me into his love again But to know so must be my benefit So shall I clothe me in a forced content And shut myself up in some other course To Fortune 's alms Alas thrice gentle Cassio My advocation is not now in tune My lord is not my lord nor should I know him Were he in favor as in humor alter'd So help me every spirit sanctified As I have spoken for you all my best And stood within the blank of his displeasure For my free speech You must awhile be patient What I can do I will and more I will Than for myself I dare Let that suffice you Is my lord angry He went hence but now And certainly in strange unquietness Can he be angry I have seen the cannon When it hath blown his ranks into the air And like the devil from his very arm Puff'd his own brother And can he be angry Something of moment then I will go meet him There 's matter in't indeed if he be angry I prithee do so Exit Iago Pray heaven it be state matters as you think And no conception nor no jealous toy Concerning you Alas the day I never gave him cause But jealous souls will not be answer'd so They are not ever jealous for the cause But jealous for they are jealous ' Tis a monster Begot upon itself born on itself Heaven keep that monster from Othello 's mind Lady amen I will go seek him Cassio walk hereabout If I do find him fit I 'll move your suit And seek to effect it to my uttermost I humbly thank your ladyship Save you friend Cassio What make you from home How is it with you my most fair Bianca I'faith sweet love I was coming to your house And I was going to your lodging Cassio What keep a week away seven days and nights Eight score eight hours and lovers ' absent hours More tedious than the dial eight score times O weary reckoning Pardon me Bianca I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd But I shall in a more continuate time Strike off this score of absence Sweet Bianca O Cassio whence came this This is some token from a newer friend To the felt absence now I feel a cause Is't come to this Well well Go to woman Throw your vile guesses in the devil 's teeth From whence you have them You are jealous now That this is from some mistress some remembrance No by my faith Bianca Why whose is it I know not sweet I found it in my chamber I like the work well Ere it be demanded- As like enough it will- I'ld have it copied Take it and do't and leave me for this time Leave you wherefore I do attend here on the general And think it no addition nor my wish To have him see me woman'd Why I pray you Not that I love you not But that you do not love me I pray you bring me on the way a little And say if I shall see you soon at night ' Tis but a little way that I can bring you For I attend here but I 'll see you soon ' Tis very good I must be circumstanced Exeunt Will you think so Think so Iago What To kiss in private An unauthorized kiss Or to be naked with her friend in bed An hour or more not meaning any harm Naked in bed Iago and not mean harm It is hypocrisy against the devil They that mean virtuously and yet do so The devil their virtue tempts and they tempt heaven So they do nothing ' tis a venial slip But if I give my wife a handkerchief- What then Why then ' tis hers my lord and being hers She may I think bestow't on any man She is protectress of her honor too May she give that Her honor is an essence that 's not seen They have it very oft that have it not But for the handkerchief- By heaven I would most gladly have forgot it Thou said'st- O it comes o'er my memory As doth the raven o'er the infected house Boding to all- he had my handkerchief Ay what of that That 's not so good now What If I had said I had seen him do you wrong Or heard him say- as knaves be such abroad Who having by their own importunate suit Or voluntary dotage of some mistress Convinced or supplied them can not choose But they must blab- Hath he said anything He hath my lord but be you well assured No more than he 'll unswear What hath he said Faith that he did- I know not what he did What what Lie- With her With her on her what you will Lie with her lie on her We say lie on her when they belie her Lie with her ' Zounds that 's fulsome Handkerchief- confessions- handkerchief To confess and be hanged for his labor- first to be hanged and then to confess I tremble at it Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing passion without some instruction It is not words that shakes me thus Pish Noses ears and lips Is't possible Confess Handkerchief O devil Work on My medicine work Thus credulous fools are caught And many worthy and chaste dames even thus All guiltless meet reproach What ho My lord My lord I say Othello What 's the matter My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy This is his second fit he had one yesterday Rub him about the temples No forbear The lethargy must have his quiet course If not he foams at mouth and by and by Breaks out to savage madness Look he stirs Do you withdraw yourself a little while He will recover straight When he is gone I would on great occasion speak with you Exit Cassio How is it general Have you not hurt your head Dost thou mock me I mock you No by heaven Would you would bear your fortune like a man A horned man 's a monster and a beast There 's many a beast then in a populous city And many a civil monster Did he confess it Good sir be a man Think every bearded fellow that 's but yoked May draw with you There 's millions now alive That nightly lie in those unproper beds Which they dare swear peculiar Your case is better O ' tis the spite of hell the fiend 's arch mock To lip a wanton in a secure couch And to suppose her chaste No let me know And knowing what I am I know what she shall be O thou art wise ' tis certain Stand you awhile apart Confine yourself but in a patient list Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief- A passion most unsuiting such a man- Cassio came hither I shifted him away And laid good ' scuse upon your ecstasy Bade him anon return and here speak with me The which he promised Do but encave yourself And mark the fleers the gibes and notable scorns That dwell in every region of his face For I will make him tell the tale anew Where how how oft how long ago and when He hath and is again to cope your wife I say but mark his gesture Marry patience Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen And nothing of a man Dost thou hear Iago I will be found most cunning in my patience But dost thou hear most bloody That 's not amiss But yet keep time in all Will you withdraw The worser that you give me the addition Whose want even kills me Ply Desdemona well and you are sure on't Now if this suit lay in Bianco 's power How quickly should you speed Alas poor caitiff Look how he laughs already I never knew a woman love man so Alas poor rogue I think i'faith she loves me Now he denies it faintly and laughs it out Do you hear Cassio Now he importunes him To tell it o'er Go to well said well said She gives it out that you shall marry her Do you intend it Ha ha ha Do you triumph Roman Do you triumph I marry her What A customer I prithee bear some charity to my wit do not think it so unwholesome Ha ha ha So so so so They laugh that win Faith the cry goes that you shall marry her Prithee say true I am a very villain else Have you scored me Well This is the monkey 's own giving out She is persuaded I will marry her out of her own love and flattery not out of my promise Iago beckons me now he begins the story She was here even now she haunts me in every place I was the other day talking on the sea bank with certain Venetians and thither comes the bauble and by this hand she falls me thus about my neck- Crying O dear Cassio as it were his gesture imports it So hangs and lolls and weeps upon me so hales and pulls me Ha ha ha Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber O I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to Well I must leave her company Before me look where she comes ' Tis such another fitchew marry a perfumed one Let the devil and his dam haunt you What did you mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now I was a fine fool to take it I must take out the work A likely piece of work that you should find it in your chamber and not know who left it there This is some minx 's token and I must take out the work There give it your hobbyhorse Wheresoever you had it I 'll take out no work on't How now my sweet Bianca how now how now By heaven that should be my handkerchief An you 'll come to supper tonight you may an you will not come when you are next prepared for Exit After her after her Faith I must she 'll rail i ' the street else Will you sup there Faith I intend so Well I may chance to see you for I would very fain speak with you Prithee come will you Go to say no more Exit Cassio Advancing How shall I murther him Iago Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice O Iago And did you see the handkerchief Was that mine Yours by this hand And to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife She gave it him and he hath given it his whore I would have him nine years akilling A fine woman a fair woman a sweet woman Nay you must forget that Ay let her rot and perish and be damned tonight for she shall not live No my heart is turned to stone I strike it and it hurts my hand O the world hath not a sweeter creature She might lie by an emperor 's side and command him tasks Nay that 's not your way Hang her I do but say what she is So delicate with her needle an admirable musician O she will sing the savageness out of a bear Of so high and plenteous wit and invention- She 's the worse for all this O a thousand a thousand times And then of so gentle a condition Ay too gentle Nay that 's certain But yet the pity of it Iago O Iago the pity of it Iago If you are so fond over her iniquity give her patent to offend for if it touch not you it comes near nobody I will chop her into messes Cuckold me O ' tis foul in her With mine officer That 's fouler Get me some poison Iago this night I 'll not expostulate with her lest her body and beauty unprovide my mind again This night Iago Do it not with poison strangle her in her bed even the bed she hath contaminated Good good the justice of it pleases very good And for Cassio let me be his undertaker You shall hear more by midnight Excellent good A trumpet within What trumpet is that same Something from Venice sure ' Tis Lodovico Come from the Duke And see your wife is with him God save the worthy general With all my heart sir The Duke and Senators of Venice greet you I kiss the instrument of their pleasures And what 's the news good cousin Lodovico I am very glad to see you signior Welcome to Cyprus I thank you How does Lieutenant Cassio Lives sir Cousin there 's fall'n between him and my lord An unkind breech but you shall make all well Are you sure of that My lord Reads This fail you not to do as you will- He did not call he 's busy in the paper Is there division ' twixt my lord and Cassio A most unhappy one I would do much To atone them for the love I bear to Cassio Fire and brimstone My lord Are you wise What is he angry May be the letter moved him For as I think they do command him home Deputing Cassio in his government By my troth I am glad on't Indeed My lord I am glad to see you mad Why sweet Othello Devil Strikes her I have not deserved this My lord this would not be believed in Venice Though I should swear I saw't ' Tis very much Make her amends she weeps O devil devil If that the earth could teem with woman 's tears Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile Out of my sight Going I will not stay to offend you Truly an obedient lady I do beseech your lordship call her back Mistress My lord What would you with her sir Who I my lord Ay you did wish that I would make her turn Sir she can turn and turn and yet go on And turn again and she can weep sir weep And she 's obedient as you say obedient Very obedient Proceed you in your tears Concerning this sir- O well painted passion!- I am commanded home Get you away I 'll send for you anon Sir I obey the mandate And will return to Venice Hence avaunt Is this the noble Moor whom our full Senate Call all in all sufficient This the nature Whom passion could not shake whose solid virtue The shot of accident nor dart of chance Could neither graze nor pierce He is much changed Are his wits safe Is he not light of brain He 's that he is I may not breathe my censure What he might be if what he might he is not I would to heaven he were What strike his wife Faith that was not so well yet would I knew That stroke would prove the worst Is it his use Or did the letters work upon his blood And new create this fault Alas alas It is not honesty in me to speak What I have seen and known You shall observe him And his own courses will denote him so That I may save my speech Do but go after And mark how he continues I am sorry that I am deceived in him Exeunt You have seen nothing then Nor ever heard nor ever did suspect Yes you have seen Cassio and she together But then I saw no harm and then I heard Each syllable that breath made up between them What did they never whisper Never my lord Nor send you out o ' the way Never To fetch her fan her gloves her mask nor nothing Never my lord That 's strange I durst my lord to wager she is honest Lay down my soul at stake If you think other Remove your thought it doth abuse your bosom If any wretch have put this in your head Let heaven requite it with the serpent 's curse

on my bare head Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes I should have found in some place of my soul A drop of patience but alas to make me A fixed figure for the time of scorn To point his slow unmoving finger at Yet could I bear that too well very well But there where I have garner'd up my heart Where either I must live or bear no life The fountain from the which my current runs Or else dries up to be discarded thence Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads To knot and gender in Turn thy complexion there Patience thou young and rose lipp'd cherubin Ay

go to him for by this light of heaven I know not how I lost him Here I kneel If e'er my will did trespass ' gainst his love Either in discourse of thought or actual deed Or that mine eyes mine ears or any sense Delighted them in any other form Or that I do not yet and ever did And ever will though he do shake me off To beggarly divorcement love him dearly Comfort forswear me Unkindness may do much And his unkindness may defeat my life But never taint my love I can not say whore It doth abhor me now I speak the word To do the act that might the addition earn Not the world 's mass of vanity could

lord and lady what hath happ'd Will you go on Aside This is the night That either makes me or fordoes me quite Exeunt It is the cause it is the cause my soul Let me not name it to you you chaste stars It is the cause Yet I 'll not shed her blood Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow And smooth as monumental alabaster Yet she must die else she 'll betray more men Put out the light and then put out the light If I quench thee thou flaming minister I can again thy former light restore Should I repent me but once put out thy light Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature I know not where is that Promethean heat That can thy light relume When I have pluck'd the rose I can not give it vital growth again It must needs wither I 'll smell it on the tree Kisses her O balmy breath that dost almost persuade Justice to break her sword One more one more Be thus when thou art dead and I will kill thee And love thee after One more and this the last So sweet was ne'er so fatal I must weep But they are cruel tears this sorrow 's heavenly It strikes where it doth love She wakes Who 's there Othello Ay Desdemona Will you come to bed my lord Have you pray'd tonight Desdemona Ay my lord If you bethink yourself of any crime Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace Solicit for it straight Alas my lord what may you mean by that Well do it and be brief I will walk by I would not kill thy unprepared spirit No heaven forfend I would not kill thy soul Talk you of killing Ay I do Then heaven have mercy on me Amen with all my heart If you say so I hope you will not kill me Hum And yet I fear you for you are fatal then When your eyes roll so Why I should fear I know not Since guiltiness I know not but yet I feel I fear Think on thy sins They are loves I bear to you Ay and for that thou diest That death 's unnatural that kills for loving Alas why gnaw you so your nether lip Some bloody passion shakes your very frame These are portents but yet I hope I hope They do not point on me Peace and be still I will so What 's the matter That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee Thou gavest to Cassio No by my life and soul Send for the man and ask him Sweet soul take heed Take heed of perjury thou are on thy deathbed Ay but not yet to die Yes presently Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin For to deny each article with oath Can not remove nor choke the strong conception That I do groan withal Thou art to die Then Lord have mercy on me I say amen And have you mercy too I never did Offend you in my life never loved Cassio But with such general warranty of heaven As I might love I never gave him token By heaven I saw my handkerchief in 's hand O perjured woman Thou dost stone my heart And makest me call what I intend to do A murther which I thought a sacrifice I saw the handkerchief He found it then I never gave it him Send for him hither Let him confess a truth He hath confess'd What my lord That he hath used thee How unlawfully Ay He will not say so No his mouth is stopp'd Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't O my fear interprets What is he dead Had all his hairs been lives my great revenge Had stomach for them all Alas he is betray'd and I undone Out strumpet Weep'st thou for him to my face O banish me my lord but kill me not Down strumpet Kill me tomorrow let me live tonight Nay if you strive- But half an hour Being done there is no pause But while I say one prayer It is too late He stifles her Within My lord my lord What ho my lord my lord What noise is this Not dead not yet quite dead I that am cruel am yet merciful I would not have thee linger in thy pain So so Within What ho my lord my lord Who 's there Within O good my lord I would speak a word with you Yes ' tis Emilia By and by She 's dead ' Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio 's death The noise was here Ha no more moving Still as the grave Shall she come in were't good I think she stirs again No What 's best to do If she come in she 'll sure speak to my wife My wife My wife What wife I have no wife O insupportable O heavy hour Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse Of sun and moon and that the affrighted globe Should yawn at alteration Within I do beseech you That I may speak with you O good my lord I had forgot thee O come in Emilia Soft by and by Let me the curtains draw Where art thou Unlocks the door O my good lord yonder 's foul murthers done What now But

kill'd No Cassio is not kill'd Not Cassio kill'd Then murther 's out of tune And sweet revenge grows harsh O falsely falsely murther'd Alas what cry is that That what Out and alas That was my lady 's voice Help help ho help O lady speak again Sweet Desdemona O sweet mistress speak A guiltless death I die O who hath done this deed Nobody I myself Farewell Commend me to my kind lord O farewell Dies Why how should she be murther'd Alas who knows You heard her say herself it was not I. She said so I must needs report the truth She 's like a liar gone to burning hell ' Twas I that kill'd her O the more angel she And you the blacker devil She turn'd to folly and she was a whore Thou dost belie her and thou art a devil She was false as water Thou art rash as fire to say That she was false O she was heavenly true Cassio did top her ask thy husband else O I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell But that I did proceed upon just grounds To this extremity Thy husband knew it all My husband Thy husband That she was false to wedlock Ay with Cassio Nay had she been true If heaven would make me such another world Of one entire and perfect chrysolite I'ld not have sold her for it My husband Ay ' twas he that told me first An honest man he is and hates the slime That sticks on filthy deeds My husband What needs this iteration woman I say thy husband O mistress villainy hath made mocks with love My husband say that she was false He woman I say thy husband Dost understand the word My friend thy husband honest honest Iago If he say so may his pernicious soul Rot half a grain a day He lies to the heart She was too fond of her most filthy bargain Ha Do thy worst This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven Than thou wast worthy her Peace you were best Thou hast not half that power to do me harm As I have to be hurt O gull O dolt As ignorant as dirt Thou hast done a deed- I care not for thy sword I 'll make thee known Though I lost twenty lives Help help ho help The Moor hath kill'd my mistress Murther murther What is the matter How now general O are you come Iago You have done well That men must lay their murthers on your neck What is the matter Disprove this villain if thou be'st a man He says thou told'st him that his wife was false I know thou didst not thou'rt not such a villain Speak for my heart is full I told him what I thought and told no more Than what he found himself was apt and true But did you ever tell him she was false I did You told a lie an odious damned lie Upon my soul a lie a wicked lie She false with Cassio Did you say with Cassio With Cassio mistress Go to charm your tongue I will not charm my tongue I am bound to speak My mistress here lies murther'd in her bed- O heavens forfend And your reports have set the murther on Nay stare not masters it is true indeed ' Tis a strange truth O monstrous act Villainy villainy villainy I think upon't I think I smell't O villainy I thought so then I 'll kill myself for grief O villainy villainy What are you mad I charge you get you home Good gentlemen let me have leave to speak ' Tis proper I obey him but not now Perchance Iago I will ne'er go home O O O Falls on the bed Nay lay thee down and roar For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent That e'er did lift up eye Rises O she was foul I scarce did know you uncle there lies your niece Whose breath indeed these hands have newly stopp'd I know this act shows horrible and grim Poor Desdemon I am glad thy father 's dead Thy match was mortal to him and pure grief Shore his old thread in twain did he live now This sight would make him do a desperate turn Yea curse his better angel from his side And fall to reprobation ' Tis pitiful but yet Iago knows That she with Cassio hath the act of shame A thousand times committed Cassio confess'd it And she did gratify his amorous works With that recognizance and pledge of love Which I first gave her I saw it in his hand It was a handkerchief an antique token My father gave my mother O heaven O heavenly powers ' Zounds Hold your peace ' Twill out ' twill I peace No I will speak as liberal as the north Let heaven and men and devils let them all All all cry shame against me yet I 'll speak Be wise and get you home I will not Fie Your sword upon a woman O thou dull Moor That handkerchief thou speak'st of I found by fortune and did give my husband For often with a solemn earnestness More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle He begg'd of me to steal it Villainous whore She give it Cassio No alas I found it And I did give't my husband Filth thou liest By heaven I do not I do not gentlemen O murtherous coxcomb What should such a fool Do with so good a wife Are there not stones in heaven But what serve for thunder Precious villain The woman falls sure he hath kill'd his wife Ay ay O lay me by my mistress ' side Exit Iago He 's gone but his wife 's kill'd ' Tis a notorious villain Take you this weapon Which I have here recover'd from the Moor Come guard the door without let him not pass But kill him rather I 'll after that same villain For ' tis a damned slave Exeunt all but Othello and Emilia I am not valiant neither But every puny whipster gets my sword But why should honor outlive honesty Let it go all What did thy song bode lady Hark canst thou hear me I will play the swan And die in music Sings Willow willow willow Moor she was chaste she loved thee cruel Moor So come my soul to bliss as I speak true So speaking as I think I die I die Dies I have another weapon in this chamber It is a sword of Spain the ice brook 's temper- O here it is Uncle I must come forth Within If thou attempt it it will cost thee dear Thou hast no weapon and perforce must suffer Look in upon me then and speak with me Or naked as I am I will assault thee What is the matter Behold I have a weapon A better never did itself sustain Upon a soldier 's thigh I have seen the day That with this little arm and this good sword I have made my way through more impediments Than twenty times your stop But O vain boast Who can control his fate ' Tis not so now Be not afraid though you do see me weapon'd Here is my journey 's end here is my butt And very sea mark of my utmost sail Do you go back dismay'd ' Tis a lost fear Man but a rush against Othello 's breast And he retires Where should Othello go Now how dost thou look now O ill starr'd wench Pale as thy smock When we shall meet at compt This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven And fiends will snatch at it Cold cold my girl Even like thy chastity O cursed cursed slave Whip me ye devils From the possession of this heavenly sight Blow me about in winds Roast me in sulphur Wash me in steep down gulfs of liquid fire O Desdemon dead Desdemon dead O O O Where is this rash and most unfortunate man That 's he that was Othello Here I am Where is that viper Bring the villain forth I look down towards his feet but that 's a fable If that thou be'st a devil I can not kill thee Wounds Iago Wrench his sword from him I bleed sir but not kill'd I am not sorry neither I'ld have thee live For in my sense ' tis happiness to die O thou Othello that wert once so good Fall'n in the practice of a damned slave What shall be said to thee Why anything An honorable murtherer if you will For nought did I in hate but all in honor This wretch hath part confess'd his villainy Did you and he consent in Cassio 's death Ay Dear general I never gave you cause I do believe it and I ask your pardon Will you I pray demand that demi devil Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body Demand me nothing what you know you know From this time forth I never will speak word What not to pray Torments will ope your lips Well thou dost best Sir you shall understand what hath befall'n Which as I think you know not Here is a letter Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo And here another The one of them imports The death of Cassio to be undertook By Roderigo O villain Most heathenish and most gross Now here 's another discontented paper Found in his pocket too and this it seems Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain But that belike Iago in the interim Came in and satisfied him O the pernicious caitiff How came you Cassio by that handkerchief That was my wife 's I found it in my chamber And he himself confess'd but even now That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose Which wrought to his desire O fool fool fool There is besides in Roderigo 's letter How he upbraids Iago that he made him Brave me upon the watch whereon it came That I was cast And even but now he spake After long seeming dead Iago hurt him Iago set him on You must forsake this room and go with us Your power and your command is taken off And Cassio rules in Cyprus For this slave If there be any cunning cruelty That can torment him much and hold him long It shall be his You shall close prisoner rest Till that the nature of your fault be known To the Venetian state Come bring away Soft you a word or two before you go I have done the state some service and they know't No more of that I pray you in your letters When you shall these unlucky deeds relate Speak of me as I am nothing extenuate Nor set down aught in malice Then must you speak Of one that loved not wisely but too well Of one not easily jealous but being wrought Perplex'd in the extreme of one whose hand Like the base Indian threw a pearl away Richer than all his tribe of one whose subdued eyes Albeit unused to the melting mood Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees Their medicinal gum Set you down this And say besides that in Aleppo once Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk Beat a Venetian and traduced the state I took by the throat the circumcised dog And smote him thus Stabs himself O bloody period All that 's spoke is marr'd I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee No way but this Killing myself to die upon a kiss This did I fear but thought he had no weapon For he was great of heart To Iago O Spartan dog More fell than anguish hunger or the sea Look on the tragic loading of this bed This is thy work The object poisons sight Let it be hid Gratiano keep the house And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor For they succeed on you To you Lord Governor Remains the censure of this hellish villain The time the place the torture O enforce it Myself will straight aboard and to the state This heavy act with heavy heart relate Exeunt Old John of Gaunt time honoured Lancaster Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal Which then our leisure would not let us hear Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray I have my liege Tell me moreover hast thou sounded him If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice Or worthily as a good subject should On some known ground of treachery in him As near as I could sift him on that argument On some apparent danger seen in him Aim'd at your Highness no inveterate malice Then call them to our presence face to face And frowning brow to brow ourselves will hear The accuser and the accused freely speak High stomach'd are they both and full of ire In rage deaf as the sea hasty as fire Many years of happy days befall My gracious sovereign my most loving liege Each day still better other 's happiness Until the heavens envying earth 's good hap Add an immortal title to your crown We thank you both yet one but flatters us As well appeareth by the cause you come Namely to appeal each other of high treason Cousin of Hereford what dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray First heaven be the record to my speech In the devotion of a subject 's love Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince And free from other misbegotten hate Come I appellant to this princely presence Now Thomas Mowbray do I turn to thee And mark my greeting well for what I speak My body shall make good upon this earth Or my divine soul answer it in heaven- Thou art a traitor and a miscreant Too good to be so and too bad to live Since the more fair and crystal is the sky The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly Once more the more to aggravate the note With a foul traitor 's name stuff I thy throat And wish so please my sovereign ere I move What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal ' Tis not the trial of a woman 's war The bitter clamour of two eager tongues Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this Yet can I not of such tame patience boast As to be hush'd and nought at an to say First the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech Which else would post until it had return'd These terms of treason doubled down his throat Setting aside his high blood 's royalty And let him be no kinsman to my liege I do defy him and I spit at him Call him a slanderous coward and a villain Which to maintain I would allow him odds And meet him were I tied to run afoot Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps Or any other ground inhabitable Where ever Englishman durst set his foot Meantime let this defend my loyalty- By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie Pale trembling coward there I throw my gage Disclaiming here the kindred of the King And lay aside my high blood 's royalty Which fear not reverence makes thee to except If guilty dread have left thee so much strength As to take up mine honour 's pawn then stoop By that and all the rites of knighthood else Will I make good against thee arm to arm What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise I take it up and by that sword I swear Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder I 'll answer thee in any fair degree Or chivalrous design of knightly trial And when I mount alive may I not light If I be traitor or unjustly fight What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray 's charge It must be great that can inherit us So much as of a thought of ill in him Look what I speak my life shall prove it true- That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles In name of lendings for your Highness ' soldiers The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments Like a false traitor and injurious villain Besides I say and will in battle prove- Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge That ever was survey'd by English eye- That all the treasons for these eighteen years Complotted and contrived in this land Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring Further I say and further will maintain Upon his bad life to make all this good That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester 's death Suggest his soon believing adversaries And consequently like a traitor coward Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood Which blood like sacrificing Abel 's cries Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth To me for justice and rough chastisement And by the glorious worth of my descent This arm shall do it or this life be spent How high a pitch his resolution soars Thomas of Norfolk what say'st thou to this O let my sovereign turn away his face And bid his ears a little while be deaf Till I have told this slander of his blood How God and good men hate so foul a liar Mowbray impartial are our eyes and cars Were he my brother nay my kingdom 's heir As he is but my father 's brother 's son Now by my sceptre 's awe I make a vow Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood Should nothing privilege him nor partialize The unstooping firmness of my upright soul He is our subject Mowbray so art thou Free speech and fearless I to thee allow Then Bolingbroke as low as to thy heart Through the false passage of thy throat thou liest Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais Disburs'd I duly to his Highness ' soldiers The other part reserv'd I by consent For that my sovereign liege was in my debt Upon remainder of a dear account Since last I went to France to fetch his queen Now swallow down that lie For Gloucester 's death- I slew him not but to my own disgrace Neglected my sworn duty in that case For you my noble Lord of Lancaster The honourable father to my foe Once did I lay an ambush for your life A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament I did confess it and exactly begg'd Your Grace 's pardon and I hope I had it This is my fault As for the rest appeal'd It issues from the rancour of a villain A recreant and most degenerate traitor Which in myself I boldly will defend And interchangeably hurl down my gage Upon this overweening traitor 's foot To prove myself a loyal gentleman Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom In haste whereof most heartily I pray Your Highness to assign our trial day Wrath kindled gentlemen be rul'd by me Let 's purge this choler without letting blood- This we prescribe though no physician Deep malice makes too deep incision Forget forgive conclude and be agreed Our doctors say this is no month to bleed Good uncle let this end where it begun We 'll calm the Duke of Norfolk you your son To be a make peace shall become my age Throw down my son the Duke of Norfolk 's gage And Norfolk throw down his When Harry when Obedience bids I should not bid again Norfolk throw down we bid There is no boot Myself I throw dread sovereign at thy foot My life thou shalt command but not my shame The one my duty owes but my fair name Despite of death that lives upon my grave To dark dishonour 's use thou shalt not have I am disgrac'd impeach'd and baffl'd here Pierc'd to the soul with slander 's venom'd spear The which no balm can cure but his heart blood Which breath'd this poison Rage must be withstood Give me his gage lions make leopards tame Yea but not change his spots Take but my shame And I resign my gage My dear dear lord The purest treasure mortal times afford Is spotless reputation that away Men are but gilded loam or painted clay A jewel in a ten times barr'd up chest Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast Mine honour is my life both grow in one Take honour from me and my life is done Then dear my liege mine honour let me try In that I live and for that will I die Cousin throw up your gage do you begin O God defend my soul from such deep sin Shall I seem crest fallen in my father 's sight Or with pale beggar fear impeach my height Before this outdar'd dastard Ere my tongue Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong Or sound so base a parle my teeth shall tear The slavish motive of recanting fear And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace Where shame doth harbour even in Mowbray 's face We were not born to sue but to command Which since we can not do to make you friends Be ready as your lives shall answer it At Coventry upon Saint Lambert 's day There shall your swords and lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your settled hate Since we can not atone you we shall see Justice design the victor 's chivalry Lord Marshal command our officers at arms Be ready to direct these home alarms Exeunt Alas the part I had in Woodstock 's blood Doth more solicit me than your exclaims To stir against the butchers of his life But since correction lieth in those hands Which made the fault that we can not correct Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven Who when they see the hours ripe on earth Will rain hot vengeance on offenders ' heads Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur Hath love in thy old blood no living fire Edward 's seven sons whereof thyself art one Were as seven vials of his sacred blood Or seven fair branches springing from one root Some of those seven are dried by nature 's course Some of those branches by the Destinies cut But Thomas my dear lord my life my Gloucester One vial full of Edward 's sacred blood One flourishing branch of his most royal root Is crack'd and all the precious liquor spilt Is hack'd down and his summer leaves all faded By envy 's hand and murder 's bloody axe Ah Gaunt his blood was thine That bed that womb That mettle that self mould that fashion'd thee Made him a man and though thou livest and breathest Yet art thou slain in him Thou dost consent In some large measure to thy father 's death In that thou seest thy wretched brother die Who was the model of thy father 's life Call it not patience Gaunt it is despair In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee That which in mean men we entitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts What shall I say To safeguard thine own life The best way is to venge my Gloucester 's death God 's is the quarrel for God 's substitute His deputy anointed in His sight Hath caus'd his death the which if wrongfully Let heaven revenge for I may never lift An angry arm against His minister Where then alas may I complain myself To God the widow 's champion and defence Why then I will Farewell old Gaunt Thou goest to Coventry there to behold Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight O sit my husband 's wrongs on Hereford 's spear That it may enter butcher Mowbray 's breast Or if misfortune miss the first career Be Mowbray 's sins so heavy in his bosom That they may break his foaming courser 's back And throw the rider headlong in the lists A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford Farewell old Gaunt thy sometimes brother 's wife With her companion Grief must end her life Sister farewell I must to Coventry As much good stay with thee as go with me Yet one word more- grief boundeth where it falls Not with the empty hollowness but weight I take my leave before I have begun For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done Commend me to thy brother Edmund York Lo this is all- nay yet depart not so Though this be all do not so quickly go I shall remember more Bid him- ah what?- With all good speed at Plashy visit me Alack and what shall good old York there see But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls Unpeopled offices untrodden stones And what hear there for welcome but my groans Therefore commend me let him not come there To seek out sorrow that dwells every where Desolate desolate will I hence and die The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye Exeunt My Lord Aumerle is Harry Hereford arm'd Yea at all points and longs to enter in The Duke of Norfolk spightfully and bold Stays but the summons of the appelant 's trumpet Why then the champions are prepar'd and stay For nothing but his Majesty 's approach Marshal demand of yonder champion The cause of his arrival here in arms Ask him his name and orderly proceed To swear him in the justice of his cause In God 's name and the King 's say who thou art And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms Against what man thou com'st and what thy quarrel Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath As so defend thee heaven and thy valour My name is Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk Who hither come engaged by my oath- Which God defend a knight should violate!- Both to defend my loyalty and truth To God my King and my succeeding issue Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me And by the grace of God and this mine arm To prove him in defending of myself A traitor to my God my King and me And as I truly fight defend me heaven Marshal ask yonder knight in arms Both who he is and why he cometh hither Thus plated in habiliments of war And formally according to our law Depose him in the justice of his cause What is thy name and wherefore com'st thou hither Before King Richard in his royal lists Against whom comest thou and what 's thy quarrel Speak like a true knight so defend thee heaven Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby Am I who ready here do stand in arms To prove by God 's grace and my body 's valour In lists on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk That he is a traitor foul and dangerous To God of heaven King Richard and to me And as I truly fight defend me heaven On pain of death no person be so bold Or daring hardy as to touch the lists Except the Marshal and such officers Appointed to direct these fair designs Lord Marshal let me kiss my sovereign 's hand And bow my knee before his Majesty For Mowbray and myself are like two men That vow a long and weary pilgrimage Then let us take a ceremonious leave And loving farewell of our several friends The appellant in all duty greets your Highness And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave We will descend and fold him in our arms Cousin of Hereford as thy cause is right So be thy fortune in this royal fight Farewell my blood which if to day thou shed Lament we may but not revenge thee dead O let no noble eye profane a tear For me if I be gor'd with Mowbray 's spear As confident as is the falcon 's flight Against a bird do I with Mowbray fight My loving lord I take my leave of you Of you my noble cousin Lord Aumerle Not sick although I have to do with death But lusty young and cheerly drawing breath Lo as at English feasts so I regreet The daintiest last to make the end most sweet O thou the earthly author of my blood Whose youthful spirit in me regenerate Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up To reach at victory above my head Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers And with thy blessings steel my lance 's point That it may enter Mowbray 's waxen coat And furbish new the name of John o ' Gaunt Even in the lusty haviour of his son God in thy good cause make thee prosperous Be swift like lightning in the execution And let thy blows doubly redoubled Fall like amazing thunder on the casque Of thy adverse pernicious enemy Rouse up thy youthful blood be valiant and live Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive However God or fortune cast my lot There lives or dies true to King Richard 's throne A loyal just and upright gentleman Never did captive with a freer heart Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement More than my dancing soul doth celebrate This feast of battle with mine adversary Most mighty liege and my companion peers Take from my mouth the wish of happy years As gentle and as jocund as to jest Go I to fight truth hath a quiet breast Farewell my lord securely I espy Virtue with valour couched in thine eye Order the trial Marshal and begin Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby Receive thy lance and God defend the right Strong as a tower in hope I cry amen To an officer Go bear this lance to Thomas Harry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby Stands here for God his sovereign and himself On pain to be found false and recreant To prove the Duke of Norfolk Thomas Mowbray A traitor to his God his King and him And dares him to set forward to the fight Here standeth Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolk On pain to be found false and recreant Both to defend himself and to approve Henry of Hereford Lancaster and Derby To God his sovereign and to him disloyal Courageously and with a free desire Attending but the signal to begin Sound trumpets and set forward combatants Let them lay by their helmets and their spears And both return back to their chairs again Withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound While we return these dukes what we decree Your will be done This must my comfort be- That sun that warms you here shall shine on me And those his golden beams to you here lent Shall point on me and gild my banishment Norfolk for thee remains a heavier doom Which I with some unwillingness pronounce The sly slow hours shall not determinate The dateless limit of thy dear exile The hopeless word of ' never to return ' Breathe I against thee upon pain of life A heavy sentence my most sovereign liege And all unlook'd for from your Highness ' mouth A dearer merit not so deep a maim As to be cast forth in the common air Have I deserved at your Highness ' hands The language I have learnt these forty years My native English now I must forgo And now my tongue 's use is to me no more Than an unstringed viol or a harp Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up Or being open put into his hands That knows no touch to tune the harmony Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips And dull unfeeling barren ignorance Is made my gaoler to attend on me I am too old to fawn upon a nurse Too far in years to be a pupil now What is thy sentence then but speechless death Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath It boots thee not to be compassionate After our sentence plaining comes too late Then thus I turn me from my countrv 's light To dwell in solemn shades of endless night Return again and take an oath with thee Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands Swear by the duty that you owe to God Our part therein we banish with yourselves To keep the oath that we administer You never shall so help you truth and God Embrace each other 's love in banishment Nor never look upon each other 's face Nor never write regreet nor reconcile This louring tempest of your home bred hate Nor never by advised purpose meet To plot contrive or complot any ill ' Gainst us our state our subjects or our land I swear And I to keep all this Norfolk so far as to mine enemy By this time had the King permitted us One of our souls had wand'red in the air Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh As now our flesh is banish'd from this land- Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm Since thou hast far to go bear not along The clogging burden of a guilty soul No Bolingbroke if ever I were traitor My name be blotted from the book of life And I from heaven banish'd as from hence But what thou art God thou and I do know And all too soon I fear the King shall rue Farewell my liege Now no way can I stray Save back to England an the world 's my way Exit Uncle even in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy grieved heart Thy sad aspect Hath from the number of his banish'd years Pluck'd four away To BOLINGBROKE Six frozen winters spent Return with welcome home from banishment How long a time lies in one little word Four lagging winters and four wanton springs End in a word such is the breath of Kings I thank my liege that in regard of me He shortens four years of my son 's exile But little vantage shall I reap thereby For ere the six years that he hath to spend Can change their moons and bring their times about My oil dried lamp and time bewasted light Shall be extinct with age and endless night My inch of taper will be burnt and done And blindfold death not let me see my son Why uncle thou hast many years to live But not a minute King that thou canst give Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow And pluck nights from me but not lend a morrow Thou can'st help time to furrow me with age But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage Thy word is current with him for my death But dead thy kingdom can not buy my breath Thy son is banish'd upon good advice Whereto thy tongue a party verdict gave Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour You urg'd me as a judge but I had rather You would have bid me argue like a father O had it been a stranger not my child To smooth his fault I should have been more mild A partial slander sought I to avoid And in the sentence my own life destroy'd Alas I look'd when some of you should say I was too strict to make mine own away But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue Against my will to do myself this wrong Cousin farewell and uncle bid him so Six years we banish him and he shall go Cousin farewell what presence must not know From where you do remain let paper show My lord no leave take I for I will ride As far as land will let me by your side O to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends I have too few to take my leave of you When the tongue 's office should be prodigal To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart Thy grief is but thy absence for a time Joy absent grief is present for that time What is six winters They are quickly gone To men in joy but grief makes one hour ten Call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure My heart will sigh when I miscall it so Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage The sullen passage of thy weary steps Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set The precious jewel of thy home return Nay rather every tedious stride I make Will but remember me what a deal of world I wander from the jewels that I love Must I not serve a long apprenticehood To foreign passages and in the end Having my freedom boast of nothing else But that I was a journeyman to grief All places that the eye of heaven visits Are to a wise man ports and happy havens Teach thy necessity to reason thus There is no virtue like necessity Think not the King did banish thee But thou the King Woe doth the heavier sit Where it perceives it is but faintly home Go say I sent thee forth to purchase honour And not the King exil'd thee or suppose Devouring pestilence hangs in our air And thou art flying to a fresher clime Look what thy soul holds dear imagine it To lie that way thou goest not whence thou com'st Suppose the singing birds musicians The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd The flowers fair ladies and thy steps no more Than a delightful measure or a dance For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite The man that mocks at it and sets it light O who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frosty Caucasus Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast Or wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantastic summer 's heat O no the apprehension of the good Gives but the greater feeling to the worse Fell sorrow 's tooth doth never rankle more Than when he bites but lanceth not the sore Come come my son I 'll bring thee on thy way Had I thy youtli and cause I would not stay Then England 's ground farewell sweet soil adieu My mother and my nurse that bears me yet Where'er I wander boast of this I can Though banish'd yet a trueborn English man Exeunt We did observe Cousin Aumerle How far brought you high Hereford on his way I brought high Hereford if you call him so But to the next high way and there I left him And say what store of parting tears were shed Faith none for me except the north east wind Which then blew bitterly against our faces Awak'd the sleeping rheum and so by chance Did grace our hollow parting with a tear What said our cousin when you parted with him ' Farewell ' And for my heart disdained that my tongue Should so profane the word that taught me craft To counterfeit oppression of such grief That words seem'd buried in my sorrow 's grave Marry would the word ' farewell ' have length'ned hours And added years to his short banishment He should have had a volume of farewells But since it would not he had none of me He is our cousin cousin but ' tis doubt When time shall call him home from banishment Whether our kinsman come to see his friends Ourself and Bushy Bagot here and Green Observ'd his courtship to the common people How he did seem to dive into their hearts With humble and familiar courtesy What reverence he did throw away on slaves Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles And patient underbearing of his fortune As ' twere to banish their affects with him Off goes his bonnet to an oyster wench A brace of draymen bid God speed him well And had the tribute of his supple knee With ' Thanks my countrymen my loving friends ' As were our England in reversion his And he our subjects ' next degree in hope Well he is gone and with him go these thoughts Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland Expedient manage must be made my liege Ere further leisure yicld them further means For their advantage and your Highness ' loss We will ourself in person to this war And for our coffers with too great a court And liberal largess are grown somewhat light We are enforc'd to farm our royal realm The revenue whereof shall furnish us For our affairs in hand If that come short Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters Whereto when they shall know what men are rich They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold And send them after to supply our wants For we will make for Ireland presently Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick my lord Suddenly taken and hath sent poste haste To entreat your Majesty to visit him Where lies he At Ely House Now put it God in the physician 's mind To help him to his grave immediately The lining of his coffers shall make coats To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars Come gentlemen let 's all go visit him Pray God we may make haste and come too late Amen Exeunt Will the King come that I may breathe my last In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth Vex not yourself nor strive not with your breath For all in vain comes counsel to his ear O but they say the tongues of dying men Enforce attention like deep harmony Where words are scarce they are seldom spent in vain For they breathe truth that breathe their words -in pain He that no more must say is listen'd more Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose More are men 's ends mark'd than their lives before The setting sun and music at the close As the last taste of sweets is sweetest last Writ in remembrance more than things long past Though Richard my life 's counsel would not hear My death 's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear No it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds As praises of whose taste the wise are fond Lascivious metres to whose venom sound The open ear of youth doth always listen Report of fashions in proud Italy Whose manners still our tardy apish nation Limps after in base imitation Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity- So it be new there 's no respect how vile- That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears Then all too late comes counsel to be heard Where will doth mutiny with wit 's regard Direct not him whose way himself will choose ' Tis breath thou lack'st and that breath wilt thou lose Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd And thus expiring do foretell of him His rash fierce blaze of riot can not last For violent fires soon burn out themselves Small showers last long but sudden storms are short He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder Light vanity insatiate cormorant Consuming means soon preys upon itself This royal throne of kings this scept'red isle This earth of majesty this seat of Mars This other Eden demi paradise This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war This happy breed of men this little world This precious stone set in the silver sea Which serves it in the office of a wall Or as a moat defensive to a house Against the envy of less happier lands This blessed plot this earth this realm this England This nurse this teeming womb of royal kings Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth Renowned for their deeds as far from home For Christian service and true chivalry As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry Of the world 's ransom blessed Mary 's Son This land of such dear souls this dear dear land Dear for her reputation through the world Is now leas'd out I die pronouncing it- Like to a tenement or pelting farm England bound in with the triumphant sea Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege Of wat'ry Neptune is now bound in with shame With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds That England that was wo nt to conquer others Hath made a shameful conquest of itself Ah would the scandal vanish with my life How happy then were my ensuing death The King is come deal mildly with his youth For young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more How fares our noble uncle Lancaster What comfort man How is't with aged Gaunt O how that name befits my composition Old Gaunt indeed and gaunt in being old Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt For sleeping England long time have I watch'd Watching breeds leanness leanness is an gaunt The pleasure that some fathers feed upon Is my strict fast I mean my children 's looks And therein fasting hast thou made me gaunt Gaunt am I for the grave gaunt as a grave Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones Can sick men play so nicely with their names No misery makes sport to mock itself Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me I mock my name great king to flatter thee Should dying men flatter with those that live No no men living flatter those that die Thou now a dying sayest thou flatterest me O no thou diest though I the sicker be I am in health I breathe and see thee ill Now He that made me knows I see thee ill Ill in myself to see and in thee seeing ill Thy death bed is no lesser than thy land Wherein thou liest in reputation sick And thou too careless patient as thou art Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure Of those physicians that first wounded thee A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown Whose compass is no bigger than thy head And yet incaged in so small a verge The waste is no whit lesser than thy land O had thy grandsire with a prophet 's eye Seen how his son 's son should destroy his sons From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd Which art possess'd now to depose thyself Why cousin wert thou regent of the world It were a shame to let this land by lease But for thy world enjoying but this land Is it not more than shame to shame it so Landlord of England art thou now not King Thy state of law is bondslave to the law And thou- A lunatic lean witted fool Presuming on an ague 's privilege Darest with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheek chasing the royal blood With fury from his native residence Now by my seat 's right royal majesty Wert thou not brother to great Edward 's son This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders O Spare me not my brother Edward 's son For that I was his father Edward 's son That blood already like the pelican Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly carous'd My brother Gloucester plain well meaning soul- Whom fair befall in heaven ' mongst happy souls!- May be a precedent and witness good That thou respect'st not spilling Edward 's blood Join with the present sickness that I have And thy unkindness be like crooked age To crop at once a too long withered flower Live in thy shame but die not shame with thee These words hereafter thy tormentors be Convey me to my bed then to my grave Love they to live that love and honour have And let them die that age and sullens have For both hast thou and both become the grave I do beseech your Majesty impute his words To wayward sickliness and age in him He loves you on my life and holds you dear As Harry Duke of Hereford were he here Right you say true as Hereford 's love so his As theirs so mine and all be as it is My liege old Gaunt commends him to your Majesty What says he Nay nothing all is said His tongue is now a stringless instrument Words life and all old Lancaster hath spent Be York the next that must be bankrupt so Though death be poor it ends a mortal woe The ripest fruit first falls and so doth he His time is spent our pilgrimage must be So much for that Now for our Irish wars We must supplant those rough rug headed kerns Which live like venom where no venom else But only they have privilege to live And for these great affairs do ask some charge Towards our assistance we do seize to us The plate coin revenues and moveables Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd How long shall I be patient Ah how long Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong Not Gloucester 's death nor Hereford 's banishment Nor Gaunt 's rebukes nor England 's private wrongs Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke About his marriage nor my own disgrace Have ever made me sour my patient cheek Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign 's face I am the last of noble Edward 's sons Of whom thy father Prince of Wales was first In war was never lion rag'd more fierce In peace was never gentle lamb more mild Than was that young and princely gentleman His face thou hast for even so look'd he Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours But when he frown'd it was against the French And not against his friends His noble hand Did win what he did spend and spent not that Which his triumphant father 's hand had won His hands were guilty of no kindred blood But bloody with the enemies of his kin O Richard York is too far gone with grief Or else he never would compare between- Why uncle what 's the matter O my liege Pardon me if you please if not I pleas'd Not to be pardoned am content withal Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford Is not Gaunt dead and doth not Hereford live Was not Gaunt just and is not Harry true Did not the one deserve to have an heir Is not his heir a well deserving son Take Hereford 's rights away and take from Time His charters and his customary rights Let not to morrow then ensue to day Be not thyself for how art thou a king But by fair sequence and succession Now afore God God forbid I say true!- If you do wrongfully seize Hereford 's rights Call in the letters patents that he hath By his attorneys general to sue His livery and deny his off'red homage You pluck a thousand dangers on your head You lose a thousand well disposed hearts And prick my tender patience to those thoughts Which honour and allegiance can not think Think what you will we seize into our hands His plate his goods his money and his lands I 'll not be by the while My liege farewell What will ensue hereof there 's none can tell But by bad courses may be understood That their events can never fall out good Exit Go Bushy to the Earl of Wiltshire straight Bid him repair to us to Ely House To see this business To morrow next We will for Ireland and ' tis time I trow And we create in absence of ourself Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England For he is just and always lov'd us well Come on our queen to morrow must we part Be merry for our time of stay is short Well lords the Duke of Lancaster is dead Ross And living too for now his son is Duke Barely in title not in revenues Richly in both if justice had her right My heart is great but it must break with silence Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue Nay speak thy mind and let him ne'er speak more That speaks thy words again to do thee harm Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford If it be so out with it boldly man Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him No good at all that I can do for him Unless you call it good to pity him Bereft and gelded of his patrimony Now afore God ' tis shame such wrongs are borne In him a royal prince and many moe Of noble blood in this declining land The King is not himself but basely led By flatterers and what they will inform Merely in hate ' gainst any of us an That will the King severely prosecute ' Gainst us our lives our children and our heirs The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes And quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he find For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts And daily new exactions are devis'd As blanks benevolences and I wot not what But what a God 's name doth become of this Wars hath not wasted it for warr'd he hath not But basely yielded upon compromise That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows More hath he spent in peace than they in wars The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm The King 's grown bankrupt like a broken man Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him He hath not money for these Irish wars His burdenous taxations notwithstanding But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke His noble kinsman most degenerate king But lords we hear this fearful tempest sing Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm We see the wind sit sore upon our sails And yet we strike not but securely perish We see the very wreck that we must suffer And unavoided is the danger now For suffering so the causes of our wreck Not so even through the hollow eyes of death I spy life peering but I dare not say How near the tidings of our comfort is Nay let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours Be confident to speak Northumberland We three are but thyself and speaking so Thy words are but as thoughts therefore be bold Then thus I have from Le Port Blanc a bay In Brittany receiv'd intelligence That Harry Duke of Hereford Rainold Lord Cobham That late broke from the Duke of Exeter His brother Archbishop late of Canterbury Sir Thomas Erpingham Sir John Ramston Sir John Norbery Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint- All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine With eight tall ships three thousand men of war Are making hither with all due expedience And shortly mean to touch our northern shore Perhaps they had ere this but that they stay The first departing of the King for Ireland If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke Imp out our drooping country 's broken wing Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre 's gilt And make high majesty look like itself Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh But if you faint as fearing to do so Stay and be secret and myself will go To horse to horse Urge doubts to them that fear Hold out my horse and I will first be there Madam your Majesty is too much sad You promis'd when you parted with the King To lay aside life harming heaviness And entertain a cheerful disposition To please the King I did to please myself I can not do it yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as grief Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard Yet again methinks Some unborn sorrow ripe in fortune 's womb Is coming towards me and my inward soul With nothing trembles At some thing it grieves More than with parting from my lord the King Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows Which shows like grief itself but is not so For sorrow 's eye glazed with blinding tears Divides one thing entire to many objects Like perspectives which rightly gaz'd upon Show nothing but confusion ey'd awry Distinguish form So your sweet Majesty Looking awry upon your lord 's departure Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail Which look'd on as it is is nought but shadows Of what it is not Then thrice gracious Queen More than your lord 's departure weep not more is not seen Or if it be ' tis with false sorrow 's eye Which for things true weeps things imaginary It may be so but yet my inward soul Persuades me it is otherwise Howe'er it be I can not but be sad so heavy sad As though on thinking on no thought I think- Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink ' Tis nothing but conceit my gracious lady ' Tis nothing less conceit is still deriv'd From some forefather grief mine is not so For nothing hath begot my something grief Or something hath the nothing that I grieve ' Tis in reversion that I do possess- But what it is that is not yet known what I can not name ' tis nameless woe I wot God save your Majesty and well met gentlemen I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland Why hopest thou so ' Tis better hope he is For his designs crave haste his haste good hope Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd That he our hope might have retir'd his power And driven into despair an enemy 's hope Who strongly hath set footing in this land The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd At Ravenspurgh Now God in heaven forbid Ah madam ' tis too true and that is worse The Lord Northumberland his son young Henry Percy The Lords of Ross Beaumond and Willoughby With all their powerful friends are fled to him Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland And all the rest revolted faction traitors We have whereupon the Earl of Worcester Hath broken his staff resign'd his stewardship And all the household servants fled with him To Bolingbroke So Green thou art the midwife to my woe And Bolingbroke my sorrow 's dismal heir Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy And I a gasping new deliver'd mother Have woe to woe sorrow to sorrow join'd Despair not madam Who shall hinder me I will despair and be at enmity With cozening hope he is a flatterer A parasite a keeper back of death Who gently would dissolve the bands of life Which false hope lingers in extremity Here comes the Duke of York With signs of war about his aged neck O full of careful business are his looks Uncle for God 's sake speak comfortable words Should I do so I should belie my thoughts Comfort 's in heaven and we are on the earth Where nothing lives but crosses cares and grief Your husband he is gone to save far off Whilst others come to make him lose at home Here am I left to underprop his land Who weak with age can not support myself Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him My lord your son was gone before I came He was why so go all which way it will The nobles they are fled the commons they are cold And will I fear revolt on Hereford 's side Sirrah get thee to Plashy to my sister Gloucester Bid her send me presently a thousand pound Hold take my ring My lord I had forgot to tell your lordship To day as I came by I called there- But I shall grieve you to report the rest What is't knave An hour before I came the Duchess died God for his mercy what a tide of woes Comes rushing on this woeful land at once I know not what to do I would to God So my untruth had not provok'd him to it The King had cut off my head with my brother 's What are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland How shall we do for money for these wars Come sister cousin I would say pray pardon me Go fellow get thee home provide some carts And bring away the armour that is there The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland But none returns For us to levy power Proportionable to the enemy Is all unpossible Besides our nearness to the King in love Is near the hate of those love not the King And that is the wavering commons for their love Lies in their purses and whoso empties them By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd If judgment lie in them then so do we Because we ever have been near the King Well I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle The Earl of Wiltshire is already there Thither will I with you for little office Will the hateful commons perform for us Except Eke curs to tear us all to pieces Will you go along with us No I will to Ireland to his Majesty Farewell If heart 's presages be not vain We three here part that ne'er shall meet again That 's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke Alas poor Duke the task he undertakes Is numb'ring sands and drinking oceans dry Where one on his side fights thousands will fly Farewell at once for once for all and ever Well we may meet again I fear me never Exeunt How far is it my lord to Berkeley now Believe me noble lord I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire These high wild hills and rough uneven ways Draws out our miles and makes them wearisome And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar Making the hard way sweet and delectable But I bethink me what a weary way From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found In Ross and Willoughby wanting your company Which I protest hath very much beguil'd The tediousness and process of my travel But theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have The present benefit which I possess And hope to joy is little less in joy Than hope enjoy'd By this the weary lords Shall make their way seem short as mine hath done By sight of what I have your noble company Of much less value is my company Than your good words But who comes here It is my son young Harry Percy Sent from my brother Worcester whencesoever Harry how fares your uncle I had thought my lord to have learn'd his health of you Why is he not with the Queen No my good lord he hath forsook the court Broken his staff of office and dispers'd The household of the King What was his reason He was not so resolv'd when last we spake together Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor But he my lord is gone to Ravenspurgh To offer service to the Duke of Hereford And sent me over by Berkeley to discover What power the Duke of York had levied there Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford boy No my good lord for that is not forgot Which ne'er I did remember to my knowledge I never in my life did look on him Then learn to know him now this is the Duke My gracious lord I tender you my service Such as it is being tender raw and young Which elder days shall ripen and confirm To more approved service and desert I thank thee gentle Percy and be sure I count myself in nothing else so happy As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends And as my fortune ripens with thy love It shall be still thy true love 's recompense My heart this covenant makes my hand thus seals it How far is it to Berkeley And what stir Keeps good old York there with his men of war There stands the castle by yon tuft of trees Mann'd with three hundred men as I have heard And in it are the Lords of York Berkeley and Seymour- None else of name and noble estimate Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby Bloody with spurring fiery red with haste Welcome my lords I wot your love pursues A banish'd traitor All my treasury Is yet but unfelt thanks which more enrich'd Shall be your love and labour 's recompense Your presence makes us rich most noble lord And far surmounts our labour to attain it Evermore thanks the exchequer of the poor Which till my infant fortune comes to years Stands for my bounty But who comes here It is my Lord of Berkeley as I guess My Lord of Hereford my message is to you My lord my answer is-'to Lancaster ' And I am come to seek that name in England And I must find that title in your tongue Before I make reply to aught you say Mistake me not my lord ' tis not my meaning To raze one title of your honour out To you my lord I come what lord you will- From the most gracious regent of this land The Duke of York to know what pricks you on To take advantage of the absent time And fright our native peace with self borne arms I shall not need transport my words by you Here comes his Grace in person My noble uncle Show me thy humble heart and not thy knee Whose duty is deceivable and false My gracious uncle!- Tut tut Grace me no grace nor uncle me no uncle I am no traitor 's uncle and that word ' grace ' In an ungracious mouth is but profane Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs Dar'd once to touch a dust of England 's ground But then more ' why?'-why have they dar'd to march So many miles upon her peaceful bosom Frighting her pale fac'd villages with war And ostentation of despised arms Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence Why foolish boy the King is left behind And in my loyal bosom lies his power Were I but now lord of such hot youth As when brave Gaunt thy father and myself Rescued the Black Prince that young Mars of men From forth the ranks of many thousand French O then how quickly should this arm of mine Now prisoner to the palsy chastise the And minister correction to thy fault Even in condition of the worst degree- In gross rebellion and detested treason Thou art a banish'd man and here art come Before the expiration of thy time In braving arms against thy sovereign As I was banish'd I was banish'd Hereford But as I come I come for Lancaster And noble uncle I beseech your Grace Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye You are my father for methinks in you I see old Gaunt alive O then my father Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd A wandering vagabond my rights and royalties Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away To upstart unthrifts Wherefore was I born If that my cousin king be King in England It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster You have a son Aumerle my noble cousin Had you first died and he been thus trod down He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay I am denied to sue my livery here And yet my letters patents give me leave My father 's goods are all distrain'd and sold And these and all are all amiss employ'd What would you have me do I am a subject And I challenge law attorneys are denied me And therefore personally I lay my claim To my inheritance of free descent The noble Duke hath been too much abused It stands your Grace upon to do him right Base men by his endowments are made great My lords of England let me tell you this I have had feeling of my cousin 's wrongs And labour'd all I could to do him right But in this kind to come in braving arms Be his own carver and cut out his way To find out right with wrong it may not be And you that do abet him in this kind Cherish rebellion and are rebels all The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is But for his own and for the right of that We all have strongly sworn to give him aid And let him never see joy that breaks that oath Well well I see the issue of these arms I can not mend it I must needs confess Because my power is weak and all ill left But if I could by Him that gave me life I would attach you all and make you stoop Unto the sovereign mercy of the King But since I can not be it known unto you I do remain as neuter So fare you well Unless you please to enter in the castle And there repose you for this night An offer uncle that we will accept But we must win your Grace to go with us To Bristow Castle which they say is held By Bushy Bagot and their complices The caterpillars of the commonwealth Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away It may be I will go with you but yet I 'll pause For I am loath to break our country 's laws Nor friends nor foes to me welcome you are Things past redress are now with me past care Exeunt My Lord of Salisbury we have stay'd ten days And hardly kept our countrymen together And yet we hear no tidings from the King Therefore we will disperse ourselves Farewell Stay yet another day thou trusty Welshman The King reposeth all his confidence in thee ' Tis thought the King is dead we will not stay The bay trees in our country are all wither'd And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven The pale fac'd moon looks bloody on the earth And lean look'd prophets whisper fearful change Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap- The one in fear to lose what they enjoy The other to enjoy by rage and war These signs forerun the death or fall of kings Farewell Our countrymen are gone and fled As well assur'd Richard their King is dead Exit Ah Richard with the eyes of heavy mind I see thy glory like a shooting star Fall to the base earth from the firmament The sun sets weeping in the lowly west Witnessing storms to come woe and unrest Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes And crossly to thy good all fortune goes Exit Bring forth these men Bushy and Green I will not vex your souls- Since presently your souls must part your bodies- With too much urging your pernicious lives For ' twere no charity yet to wash your blood From off my hands here in the view of men I will unfold some causes of your deaths You have misled a prince a royal king A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments By you unhappied and disfigured clean You have in manner with your sinful hours Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him Broke the possession of a royal bed And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen 's cheeks With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs Myself a prince by fortune of my birth Near to the King in blood and near in love Till you did make him misinterpret me- Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds Eating the bitter bread of banishment Whilst you have fed upon my signories Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods From my own windows torn my household coat Raz'd out my imprese leaving me no sign Save men 's opinions and my living blood To show the world I am a gentleman This and much more much more than twice all this Condemns you to the death See them delivered over To execution and the hand of death More welcome is the stroke of death to me Than Bolingbroke to England Lords farewell My comfort is that heaven will take our souls And plague injustice with the pains of hell My Lord Northumberland see them dispatch'd A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd With letters of your love to her at large Thanks gentle uncle Come lords away To fight with Glendower and his complices Awhile to work and after holiday Exeunt Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand Yea my lord How brooks your Grace the air After your late tossing on the breaking seas Needs must I like it well I weep for joy To stand upon my kingdom once again Dear earth I do salute thee with my hand Though rebels wound thee with their horses ' hoofs As a long parted mother with her child Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting So weeping smiling greet I thee my earth And do thee favours with my royal hands Feed not thy sovereign 's foe my gentle earth Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense But let thy spiders that suck up thy venom And heavy gaited toads lie in their way Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet Which with usurping steps do trample thee Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower Guard it I pray thee with a lurking adder Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch Throw death upon thy sovereign 's enemies Mock not my senseless conjuration lords This earth shall have a feeling and these stones Prove armed soldiers ere her native king Shall falter under foul rebellion 's arms Fear not my lord that Power that made you king Hath power to keep you king in spite of all The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd And not neglected else if heaven would And we will not heaven 's offer we refuse The proffered means of succour and redress He means my lord that we are too remiss Whilst Bolingbroke through our security Grows strong and great in substance and in power Discomfortable cousin know'st thou not That when the searching eye of heaven is hid Behind the globe that lights the lower world Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen In murders and in outrage boldly here But when from under this terrestrial ball He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines And darts his light through every guilty hole Then murders treasons and detested sins The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs Stand bare and naked trembling at themselves So when this thief this traitor Bolingbroke Who all this while hath revell'd in the night Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes Shall see us rising in our throne the east His treasons will sit blushing in his face Not able to endure the sight of day But self affrighted tremble at his sin Not all the water in the rough rude sea Can wash the balm off from an anointed king The breath of worldly men can not depose The deputy elected by the Lord For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay A glorious angel Then if angels fight Weak men must fall for heaven still guards the right Nor near nor farther off my gracious lord Than this weak arm Discomfort guides my tongue And bids me speak of nothing but despair One day too late I fear me noble lord Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth O call back yesterday bid time return And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men To day to day unhappy day too late O'erthrows thy joys friends fortune and thy state For all the Welshmen hearing thou wert dead Are gone to Bolingbroke dispers'd and fled Comfort my liege why looks your Grace so pale But now the blood of twenty thousand men Did triumph in my face and they are fled And till so much blood thither come again Have I not reason to look pale and dead All souls that will be safe fly from my side For time hath set a blot upon my pride Comfort my liege remember who you are I had forgot myself am I not King Awake thou coward majesty thou sleepest Is not the King 's name twenty thousand names Arm arm my name a puny subject strikes At thy great glory Look not to the ground Ye favourites of a king are we not high High be our thoughts I know my uncle York Hath power enough to serve our turn But who comes here More health and happiness betide my liege Than can my care tun'd tongue deliver him Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold Say is my kingdom lost Why ' twas my care And what loss is it to be rid of care Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we Greater he shall not be if he serve God We 'll serve him too and be his fellow so Revolt our subjects That we can not mend They break their faith to God as well as us Cry woe destruction ruin and decay- The worst is death and death will have his day Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd To bear the tidings of calamity Like an unseasonable stormy day Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears So high above his limits swells the rage Of Bolingbroke covering your fearful land With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel White beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps Against thy majesty boys with women 's voices Strive to speak big and clap their female joints In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows Of double fatal yew against thy state Yea distaff women manage rusty bills Against thy seat both young and old rebel And all goes worse than I have power to tell Too well too well thou tell'st a tale so in Where is the Earl of Wiltshire Where is Bagot What is become of Bushy Where is Green That they have let the dangerous enemy Measure our confines with such peaceful steps If we prevail their heads shall pay for it I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke Peace have they made with him indeed my lord O villains vipers damn'd without redemption Dogs easily won to fawn on any man Snakes in my heart blood warm'd that sting my heart Three Judases each one thrice worse than Judas Would they make peace Terrible hell make war Upon their spotted souls for this offence Sweet love I see changing his property Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate Again uncurse their souls their peace is made With heads and not with hands those whom you curse Have felt the worst of death 's destroying wound And lie full low grav'd in the hollow ground Is Bushy Green and the Earl of Wiltshire dead Ay all of them at Bristow lost their heads Where is the Duke my father with his power No matter where of comfort no man speak Let 's talk of graves of worms and epitaphs Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth Let 's choose executors and talk of wills And yet not so for what can we bequeath Save our deposed bodies to the ground Our lands our lives and an are Bolingbroke 's And nothing can we can our own but death And that small model of the barren earth Which serves as paste and cover to our bones For God 's sake let us sit upon the ground And tell sad stories of the death of kings How some have been depos'd some slain in war Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd Some poison'd by their wives some sleeping kill'd All murder'd for within the hollow crown That rounds the mortal temples of a king Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp Allowing him a breath a little scene To monarchize be fear'd and kill with looks Infusing him with self and vain conceit As if this flesh which walls about our life Were brass impregnable and humour'd thus Comes at the last and with a little pin Bores through his castle wall and farewell king Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood With solemn reverence throw away respect Tradition form and ceremonious duty For you have but mistook me all this while I live with bread like you feel want Taste grief need friends subjected thus How can you say to me I am a king My lord wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes But presently prevent the ways to wail To fear the foe since fear oppresseth strength Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe And so your follies fight against yourself Fear and be slain no worse can come to fight And fight and die is death destroying death Where fearing dying pays death servile breath My father hath a power inquire of him And learn to make a body of a limb Thou chid'st me well Proud Bolingbroke I come To change blows with thee for our day of doom This ague fit of fear is over blown An easy task it is to win our own Say Scroop where lies our uncle with his power Speak sweetly man although thy looks be sour Men judge by the complexion of the sky The state in inclination of the day So may you by my dull and heavy eye My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say I play the torturer by small and small To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke And all your northern castles yielded up And all your southern gentlemen in arms Upon his party Thou hast said enough My liege one word He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue Discharge my followers let them hence away From Richard 's night to Bolingbroke 's fair day Exeunt So that by this intelligence we learn The Welshmen are dispers'd and Salisbury Is gone to meet the King who lately landed With some few private friends upon this coast The news is very fair and good my lord Richard not far from hence hath hid his head It would beseem the Lord Northumberland To say ' King Richard ' Alack the heavy day When such a sacred king should hide his head Your Grace mistakes only to be brief Left I his title out The time hath been Would you have been so brief with him he would Have been so brief with you to shorten you For taking so the head your whole head 's length Mistake not uncle further than you should Take not good cousin further than you should Lest you mistake The heavens are over our heads I know it uncle and oppose not myself Against their will But who comes here The castle royally is mann'd my lord Against thy entrance Royally Why it contains no king Yes my good lord It doth contain a king King Richard lies Within the limits of yon lime and stone And with him are the Lord Aumerle Lord Salisbury Sir Stephen Scroop besides a clergyman Of holy reverence who I can not learn O belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle To NORTHUMBERLAND Noble lord Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley Into his ruin'd ears and thus deliver Henry Bolingbroke On both his knees doth kiss King Richard 's hand And sends allegiance and true faith of heart To his most royal person hither come Even at his feet to lay my arms and power Provided that my banishment repeal'd And lands restor'd again be freely granted If not I 'll use the advantage of my power And lay the summer 's dust with showers of blood Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke It is such crimson tempest should bedrench The fresh green lap of fair King Richard 's land My stooping duty tenderly shall show Go signify as much while here we march Upon the grassy carpet of this plain Yet he looks like a king Behold his eye As bright as is the eagle 's lightens forth Controlling majesty Alack alack for woe That any harm should stain so fair a show To NORTHUMBERLAND We are amaz'd and thus long The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King Should so with civil and uncivil arms Be rush'd upon Thy thrice noble cousin Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand And by the honourable tomb he swears That stands upon your royal grandsire 's bones And by the royalties of both your bloods Currents that spring from one most gracious head And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt And by the worth and honour of himself Comprising all that may be sworn or said His coming hither hath no further scope Than for his lineal royalties and to beg Enfranchisement immediate on his knees Which on thy royal party granted once His glittering arms he will commend to rust His barbed steeds to stables and his heart To faithful service of your Majesty This swears he as he is a prince is just And as I am a gentleman I credit him Northumberland say thus the King returns His noble cousin is right welcome hither And all the number of his fair demands Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction With all the gracious utterance thou hast Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends To AUMERLE We do debase ourselves cousin do we not To look so poorly and to speak so fair Shall we call back Northumberland and send Defiance to the traitor and so die No good my lord let 's fight with gentle words Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords O God O God that e'er this tongue of mine That laid the sentence of dread banishment On yon proud man should take it off again With words of sooth O that I were as great As is my grief or lesser than my name Or that I could forget what I have been Or not remember what I must be now Swell'st thou proud heart I 'll give thee scope to beat Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke What must the King do now Must he submit The King shall do it Must he be depos'd The King shall be contented Must he lose The name of king A God 's name let it go I 'll give my jewels for a set of beads My gorgeous palace for a hermitage My gay apparel for an almsman 's gown My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood My sceptre for a palmer 's walking staff My subjects for a pair of carved saints And my large kingdom for a little grave A little little grave an obscure grave- Or I 'll be buried in the king 's high way Some way of common trade where subjects ' feet May hourly trample on their sovereign 's head For on my heart they tread now whilst I live And buried once why not upon my head Aumerle thou weep'st my tender hearted cousin We 'll make foul weather with despised tears Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn And make a dearth in this revolting land Or shall we play the wantons with our woes And make some pretty match with shedding tears As thus to drop them still upon one place Till they have fretted us a pair of graves Within the earth and therein laid there lies Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes Would not this ill do well Well well I see I talk but idly and you laugh at me Most mighty prince my Lord Northumberland What says King Bolingbroke Will his Majesty Give Richard leave to live till Richard die You make a leg and Bolingbroke says ay My lord in the base court he doth attend To speak with you may it please you to come down Down down I come like glist'ring Phaethon Wanting the manage of unruly jades In the base court Base court where kings grow base To come at traitors ' calls and do them grace In the base court Come down Down court down king For night owls shriek where mounting larks should sing What says his Majesty Sorrow and grief of heart Makes him speak fondly like a frantic man Yet he is come Stand all apart And show fair duty to his Majesty He kneels down My gracious lord- Fair cousin you debase your princely knee To make the base earth proud with kissing it Me rather had my heart might feel your love Than my unpleas'd eye see your courtesy Up cousin up your heart is up I know Touching his own head Thus high at least although your My gracious lord I come but for mine own Your own is yours and I am yours and all So far be mine my most redoubted lord As my true service shall deserve your love Well you deserve They well deserve to have That know the strong'st and surest way to get Uncle give me your hands nay dry your eyes Tears show their love but want their remedies Cousin I am too young to be your father Though you are old enough to be my heir What you will have I 'll give and willing too For do we must what force will have us do Set on towards London Cousin is it so Yea my good lord Then I must not say no Flourish Exeunt What sport shall we devise here in this garden To drive away the heavy thought of care Madam we 'll play at bowls ' Twill make me think the world is full of rubs And that my fortune runs against the bias Madam we 'll dance My legs can keep no measure in delight When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief Therefore no dancing girl some other sport Madam we 'll tell tales Of sorrow or of joy Of either madam Of neither girl For if of joy being altogether wanting It doth remember me the more of sorrow Or if of grief being altogether had It adds more sorrow to my want of joy For what I have I need not to repeat And what I want it boots not to complain Madam I 'll sing ' Tis well ' that thou hast cause But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep I could weep madam would it do you good And I could sing would weeping do me good And never borrow any tear of thee Go bind thou up yon dangling apricocks Which like unruly children make their sire Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight Give some supportance to the bending twigs Go thou and Eke an executioner Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays That look too lofty in our commonwealth All must be even in our government You thus employ'd I will go root away The noisome weeds which without profit suck The soil 's fertility from wholesome flowers Why should we in the compass of a pale Keep law and form and due proportion Showing as in a model our firm estate When our sea walled garden the whole land Is full of weeds her fairest flowers chok'd up Her fruit trees all unprun'd her hedges ruin'd Her knots disordered and her wholesome herbs Swarming with caterpillars Hold thy peace He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf The weeds which his broad spreading leaves did shelter That seem'd in eating him to hold him up Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke- I mean the Earl of Wiltshire Bushy Green What are they dead They are and Bolingbroke Hath seiz'd the wasteful King O what pity is it That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land As we this garden We at time of year Do wound the bark the skin of our fruit trees Lest being over proud in sap and blood With too much riches it confound itself Had he done so to great and growing men They might have Ev'd to bear and he to taste Their fruits of duty Superfluous branches We lop away that bearing boughs may live Had he done so himself had home the crown Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down What think you the King shall be deposed Depress'd he is already and depos'd ' Tis doubt he will be Letters came last night To a dear friend of the good Duke of York 's That tell black tidings O I am press'd to death through want of speaking Pardon me madam little joy have To breathe this news yet what I say is true King Richard he is in the mighty hold Of Bolingbroke Their fortunes both are weigh'd In your lord 's scale is nothing but himself And some few vanities that make him light But in the balance of great Bolingbroke Besides himself are all the English peers And with that odds he weighs King Richard down Post you to London and you will find it so I speak no more than every one doth know Nimble mischance that art so light of foot Doth not thy embassage belong to me And am I last that knows it O thou thinkest To serve me last that I may longest keep Thy sorrow in my breast Come ladies go To meet at London London 's King in woe What was I born to this that my sad look Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke Gard'ner for telling me these news of woe Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow Poor Queen so that thy state might be no worse I would my skill were subject to thy curse Here did she fall a tear here in this place I 'll set a bank of rue sour herb of grace Rue even for ruth here shortly shall be seen In the remembrance of a weeping queen Exeunt Call forth Bagot Now Bagot freely speak thy mind- What thou dost know of noble Gloucester 's death Who wrought it with the King and who perform'd The bloody office of his timeless end Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle Cousin stand forth and look upon that man My Lord Aumerle I know your daring tongue Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd In that dead time when Gloucester 's death was plotted I heard you say ' Is not my arm of length That reacheth from the restful English Court As far as Calais to mine uncle 's head ' Amongst much other talk that very time I heard you say that you had rather refuse The offer of an hundred thousand crowns Than Bolingbroke 's return to England Adding withal how blest this land would be In this your cousin 's death Princes and noble lords What answer shall I make to this base man Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars On equal terms to give him chastisement Either I must or have mine honour soil'd With the attainder of his slanderous lips There is my gage the manual seal of death That marks thee out for hell I say thou liest And will maintain what thou hast said is false In thy heart blood through being all too base To stain the temper of my knightly sword Bagot forbear thou shalt not take it up Excepting one I would he were the best In all this presence that hath mov'd me so If that thy valour stand on sympathy There is my gage Aumerle in gage to thine By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st I heard thee say and vauntingly thou spak'st it That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester 's death If thou deniest it twenty times thou liest And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart Where it was forged with my rapier 's point Thou dar'st not coward live to see that day Now by my soul I would it were this hour Fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this Aumerle thou liest his honour is as true In this appeal as thou art an unjust And that thou art so there I throw my gage To prove it on thee to the extremest point Of mortal breathing Seize it if thou dar'st An if I do not may my hands rot of And never brandish more revengeful steel Over the glittering helmet of my foe I task the earth to the like forsworn Aumerle And spur thee on with fun as many lies As may be halloa'd in thy treacherous ear From sun to sun There is my honour 's pawn Engage it to the trial if thou darest Who sets me else By heaven I 'll throw at all I have a thousand spirits in one breast To answer twenty thousand such as you My Lord Fitzwater I do remember well The very time Aumerle and you did talk ' Tis very true you were in presence then And you can witness with me this is true As false by heaven as heaven itself is true Surrey thou liest Dishonourable boy That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword That it shall render vengeance and revenge Till thou the lie giver and that lie do he In earth as quiet as thy father 's skull In proof whereof there is my honour 's pawn Engage it to the trial if thou dar'st How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse If I dare eat or drink or breathe or live I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness And spit upon him whilst I say he lies And lies and lies There is my bond of faith To tie thee to my strong correction As I intend to thrive in this new world Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal Besides I heard the banish'd Norfolk say That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men To execute the noble Duke at Calais Some honest Christian trust me with a gage That Norfolk lies Here do I throw down this If he may be repeal'd to try his honour These differences shall all rest under gage Till Norfolk be repeal'd repeal'd he shall be And though mine enemy restor'd again To all his lands and signories When he is return'd Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial That honourable day shall never be seen Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross Against black pagans Turks and Saracens And toil'd with works of war retir'd himself To Italy and there at Venice gave His body to that pleasant country 's earth And his pure soul unto his captain Christ Under whose colours he had fought so long Why Bishop is Norfolk dead As surely as I live my lord Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom Of good old Abraham Lords appellants Your differences shall all rest under gage Till we assign you to your days of trial Great Duke of Lancaster I come to the From plume pluck'd Richard who with willing soul Adopts thee heir and his high sceptre yields To the possession of thy royal hand Ascend his throne descending now from him- And long live Henry fourth of that name In God 's name I 'll ascend the regal throne Marry God forbid Worst in this royal presence may I speak Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth Would God that any in this noble presence Were enough noble to be upright judge Of noble Richard Then true noblesse would Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong What subject can give sentence on his king And who sits here that is not Richard 's subject Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear Although apparent guilt be seen in them And shall the figure of God 's majesty His captain steward deputy elect Anointed crowned planted many years Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath And he himself not present O forfend it God That in a Christian climate souls refin'd Should show so heinous black obscene a deed I speak to subjects and a subject speaks Stirr'd up by God thus boldly for his king My Lord of Hereford here whom you call king Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford 's king And if you crown him let me prophesy- The blood of English shall manure the ground And future ages groan for this foul act Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound Disorder horror fear and mutiny Shall here inhabit and this land be call'd The field of Golgotha and dead men 's skulls O if you raise this house against this house It will the woefullest division prove That ever fell upon this cursed earth Prevent it resist it let it not be so Lest child child 's children cry against you woe Well have you argued sir and for your pains Of capital treason we arrest you here My Lord of Westminster be it your charge To keep him safely till his day of trial May it please you lords to grant the commons ' suit Fetch hither Richard that in common view He may surrender so we shall proceed Without suspicion I will be his conduct Exit Lords you that here are under our arrest Procure your sureties for your days of answer Little are we beholding to your love And little look'd for at your helping hands Alack why am I sent for to a king Before I have shook off the regal thoughts Wherewith I reign'd I hardly yet have learn'd To insinuate flatter bow and bend my knee Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me To this submission Yet I well remember The favours of these men Were they not mine Did they not sometime cry ' All hail ' to me So Judas did to Christ but he in twelve Found truth in all but one I in twelve thousand none God save the King Will no man say amen Am I both priest and clerk Well then amen God save the King although I be not he And yet amen if heaven do think him me To do what service am I sent for hither To do that office of thine own good will Which tired majesty did make thee offer- The resignation of thy state and crown To Henry Bolingbroke Give me the crown Here cousin seize the crown Here cousin On this side my hand and on that side thine Now is this golden crown like a deep well That owes two buckets filling one another The emptier ever dancing in the air The other down unseen and full of water That bucket down and fun of tears am I Drinking my griefs whilst you mount up on high I thought you had been willing to resign My crown I am but still my griefs are mine You may my glories and my state depose But not my griefs still am I king of those Part of your cares you give me with your crown Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down My care is loss of care by old care done Your care is gain of care by new care won The cares I give I have though given away They tend the crown yet still with me they stay Are you contented to resign the crown Ay no no ay for I must nothing be Therefore no no for I resign to thee Now mark me how I will undo myself I give this heavy weight from off my head And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand The pride of kingly sway from out my heart With mine own tears I wash away my balm With mine own hands I give away my crown With mine own tongue deny my sacred state With mine own breath release all duteous oaths All pomp and majesty I do forswear My manors rents revenues I forgo My acts decrees and statutes I deny God pardon all oaths that are broke to me God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee Make me that nothing have with nothing griev'd And thou with all pleas'd that hast an achiev'd Long mayst thou live in Richard 's seat to sit And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit God save King Henry unking'd Richard says And send him many years of sunshine days What more remains No more but that you read These accusations and these grievous crimes Committed by your person and your followers Against the state and profit of this land That by confessing them the souls of men May deem that you are worthily depos'd Must I do so And must I ravel out My weav'd up follies Gentle Northumberland If thy offences were upon record Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop To read a lecture of them If thou wouldst There shouldst thou find one heinous article Containing the deposing of a king And cracking the strong warrant of an oath Mark'd with a blot damn'd in the book of heaven Nay all of you that stand and look upon me Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands Showing an outward pity yet you Pilates Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross And water can not wash away your sin My lord dispatch read o'er these articles Mine eyes are full of tears I can not see And yet salt water blinds them not so much But they can see a sort of traitors here Nay if I turn mine eyes upon myself I find myself a traitor with the rest For I have given here my soul 's consent T'undeck the pompous body of a king Made glory base and sovereignty a slave Proud majesty a subject state a peasant My lord- No lord of thine thou haught insulting man Nor no man 's lord I have no name no tide- No not that name was given me at the font- But ' tis usurp'd Alack the heavy day That I have worn so many winters out And know not now what name to call myself O that I were a mockery king of snow Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke To melt myself away in water drops Good king great king and yet not greatly good An if my word be sterling yet in England Let it command a mirror hither straight That it may show me what a face I have Since it is bankrupt of his majesty Go some of you and fetch a looking glass Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come Fiend thou torments me ere I come to hell Urge it no more my Lord Northumberland The Commons will not then be satisfied They shall be satisfied I 'll read enough When I do see the very book indeed Where all my sins are writ and that 's myself The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd The shadow of your face Say that again The shadow of my sorrow Ha let 's see ' Tis very true my grief lies all within And these external manner of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul There lies the substance and I thank thee king For thy great bounty that not only giv'st Me cause to wail but teachest me the way How to lament the cause I 'll beg one boon And then be gone and trouble you no more Shall I obtain it Name it fair cousin Fair cousin I am greater than a king For when I was a king my flatterers Were then but subjects being now a subject I have a king here to my flatterer Being so great I have no need to beg Yet ask And shall I have You shall Then give me leave to go Whither Whither you will so I were from your sights Go some of you convey him to the Tower O good Convey Conveyers are you all That rise thus nimbly by a true king 's fall On Wednesday next we solemnly set down Our coronation Lords prepare yourselves A woeful pageant have we here beheld The woe 's to come the children yet unborn Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn You holy clergymen is there no plot To rid the realm of this pernicious blot My lord Before I freely speak my mind herein You shall not only take the sacrament To bury mine intents but also to effect Whatever I shall happen to devise I see your brows are full of discontent Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears Come home with me to supper I will lay A plot shall show us all a merry day Exeunt This way the King will come this is the way To Julius Caesar 's ill erected tower To whose flint bosom my condemned lord Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke Here let us rest if this rebellious earth Have any resting for her true King 's queen Join not with grief fair woman do not so To make my end too sudden Learn good soul To think our former state a happy dream From which awak'd the truth of what we are Shows us but this I am sworn brother sweet To grim Necessity and he and Will keep a league till death Hie thee to France And cloister thee in some religious house Our holy lives must win a new world 's crown Which our profane hours here have thrown down What is my Richard both in shape and mind Transform'd and weak'ned Hath Bolingbroke depos'd Thine intellect Hath he been in thy heart The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw And wounds the earth if nothing else with rage To be o'erpow'r'd and wilt thou pupil like Take the correction mildly kiss the rod And fawn on rage with base humility Which art a lion and the king of beasts A king of beasts indeed If aught but beasts I had been still a happy king of men Good sometimes queen prepare thee hence for France Think I am dead and that even here thou takest As from my death bed thy last living leave In winter 's tedious nights sit by the fire With good old folks and let them tell thee tales Of woeful ages long ago betid And ere thou bid good night to quit their griefs Tell thou the lamentable tale of me And send the hearers weeping to their beds For why the senseless brands will sympathize The heavy accent of thy moving tongue And in compassion weep the fire out And some will mourn in ashes some coal black For the deposing of a rightful king My lord the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd You must to Pomfret not unto the Tower And madam there is order ta'en for you With all swift speed you must away to France Northumberland thou ladder wherewithal The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne The time shall not be many hours of age More than it is ere foul sin gathering head Shall break into corruption Thou shalt think Though he divide the realm and give thee half It is too little helping him to all And he shall think that thou which knowest the way To plant unrightful kings wilt know again Being ne'er so little urg'd another way To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne The love of wicked men converts to fear That fear to hate and hate turns one or both To worthy danger and deserved death My guilt be on my head and there an end Take leave and part for you must part forthwith Doubly divorc'd Bad men you violate A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me And then betwixt me and my married wife Let me unkiss the oath ' twixt thee and me And yet not so for with a kiss ' twas made Part us Northumberland I towards the north Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime My wife to France from whence set forth in pomp She came adorned hither like sweet May Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day And must we be divided Must we part Ay hand from hand my love and heart from heart Banish us both and send the King with me That were some love but little policy Then whither he goes thither let me go So two together weeping make one woe Weep thou for me in France I for thee here Better far off than near be ne'er the near Go count thy way with sighs I mine with groans So longest way shall have the longest moans Twice for one step I 'll groan the way being short And piece the way out with a heavy heart Come come in wooing sorrow let 's be brief Since wedding it there is such length in grief One kiss shall stop our mouths and dumbly part Thus give I mine and thus take I thy heart Give me mine own again ' twere no good part To take on me to keep and kill thy heart So now I have mine own again be gone That I may strive to kill it with a groan We make woe wanton with this fond delay Once more adieu the rest let sorrow say Exeunt My Lord you told me you would tell the rest When weeping made you break the story off Of our two cousins ' coming into London Where did I leave At that sad stop my lord Where rude misgoverned hands from windows ' tops Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard 's head Then as I said the Duke great Bolingbroke Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know With slow but stately pace kept on his course Whilst all tongues cried ' God save thee Bolingbroke ' You would have thought the very windows spake So many greedy looks of young and old Through casements darted their desiring eyes Upon his visage and that all the walls With painted imagery had said at once ' Jesu preserve thee Welcome Bolingbroke ' Whilst he from the one side to the other turning Bareheaded lower than his proud steed 's neck Bespake them thus ' I thank you countrymen ' And thus still doing thus he pass'd along Alack poor Richard where rode he the whilst As in a theatre the eyes of men After a well grac'd actor leaves the stage Are idly bent on him that enters next Thinking his prattle to be tedious Even so or with much more contempt men 's eyes Did scowl on gentle Richard no man cried ' God save him ' No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home But dust was thrown upon his sacred head Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off His face still combating with tears and smiles The badges of his grief and patience That had not God for some strong purpose steel'd The hearts of men they must perforce have melted And barbarism itself have pitied him But heaven hath a hand in these events To whose high will we bound our calm contents To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now Whose state and honour I for aye allow Here comes my son Aumerle Aumerle that was But that is lost for being Richard 's friend And madam you must call him Rudand now I am in Parliament pledge for his truth And lasting fealty to the new made king Welcome my son Who are the violets now That strew the green lap of the new come spring Madam I know not nor I greatly care not God knows I had as lief be none as one Well bear you well in this new spring of time Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime What news from Oxford Do these justs and triumphs hold For aught I know my lord they do You will be there I know If God prevent not I purpose so What seal is that that without thy bosom Yea look'st thou pale Let me see the writing My lord ' tis nothing No matter then who see it I will be satisfied let me see the writing I do beseech your Grace to pardon me It is a matter of small consequence Which for some reasons I would not have seen Which for some reasons sir I mean to see I fear I fear- What should you fear ' Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into For gay apparel ' gainst the triumph day Bound to himself What doth he with a bond That he is bound to Wife thou art a fool Boy let me see the writing I do beseech you pardon me I may not show it I will be satisfied let me see it I say What is the matter my lord Ho who is within there Why York what is it my lord Give me my boots I say saddle my horse What is the matter Peace foolish woman I will not peace What is the matter Aumerle Good mother be content it is no more Than my poor life must answer Thy life answer Bring me my boots I will unto the King Strike him Aumerle Poor boy thou art amaz'd Hence villain never more come in my sight Give me my boots I say Why York what wilt thou do Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own Have we more sons or are we like to have Is not my teeming date drunk up with time And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age And rob me of a happy mother 's name Is he not like thee Is he not thine own Thou fond mad woman Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament And interchangeably set down their hands To kill the King at Oxford He shall be none We 'll keep him here Then what is that to him Away fond woman were he twenty times my son I would appeach him Hadst thou groan'd for him As I have done thou wouldst be more pitiful But now I know thy mind thou dost suspect That I have been disloyal to thy bed And that he is a bastard not thy son Sweet York sweet husband be not of that mind He is as like thee as a man may be Not like to me or any of my kin And yet I love him Make way unruly woman Exit After Aumerle Mount thee upon his horse Spur post and get before him to the King And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee I 'll not be long behind though I be old I doubt not but to ride as fast as York And never will I rise up from the ground Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee Away be gone Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son ' Tis full three months since I did see him last If any plague hang over us ' tis he I would to God my lords he might be found Inquire at London ' mongst the taverns there For there they say he daily doth frequent With unrestrained loose companions Even such they say as stand in narrow lanes And beat our watch and rob our passengers Which he young wanton and effeminate boy Takes on the point of honour to support So dissolute a crew My lord some two days since I saw the Prince And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford And what said the gallant His answer was he would unto the stews And from the common'st creature pluck a glove And wear it as a favour and with that He would unhorse the lustiest challenger As dissolute as desperate yet through both I see some sparks of better hope which elder years May happily bring forth But who comes here Where is the King What means our cousin that he stares and looks So wildly God save your Grace I do beseech your Majesty To have some conference with your Grace alone Withdraw yourselves and leave us here alone For ever may my knees grow to the earth Intended or committed was this fault If on the first how heinous e'er it be To win thy after love I pardon thee Then give me leave that I may turn the key That no man enter till my tale be done Have thy desire Within My liege beware look to thyself Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there Drawing Villain I 'll make thee safe Stay thy revengeful hand thou hast no cause to fear Within Open the door secure foolhardy King Shall I for love speak treason to thy face Open the door or I will break it open What is the matter uncle Speak Recover breath tell us how near is danger That we may arm us to encounter it Peruse this writing here and thou shalt know The treason that my haste forbids me show Remember as thou read'st thy promise pass'd I do repent me read not my name there My heart is not confederate with my hand It was villain ere thy hand did set it down I tore it from the traitor 's bosom King Fear and not love begets his penitence Forget to pity him lest thy pity prove A serpent that will sting thee to the heart O heinous strong and bold conspiracy O loyal father of a treacherous son Thou sheer immaculate and silver fountain From whence this stream through muddy passages Hath held his current and defil'd himself Thy overflow of good converts to bad And thy abundant goodness shall excuse This deadly blot in thy digressing son So shall my virtue be his vice 's bawd And he shall spend mine honour with his shame As thriftless sons their scraping fathers ' gold Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies Or my sham'd life in his dishonour lies Thou kill'st me in his life giving him breath The traitor lives the true man 's put to death Within I What ho my liege for God 's sake let me in What shrill voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry Within A woman and thine aunt great King ' tis I. Speak with me pity me open the door A beggar begs that never begg'd before Our scene is alt'red from a serious thing And now chang'd to ' The Beggar and the King ' My dangerous cousin let your mother in I know she is come to pray for your foul sin If thou do pardon whosoever pray More sins for this forgiveness prosper may This fest'red joint cut off the rest rest sound This let alone will all the rest confound O King believe not this hard hearted man Love loving not itself none other can Thou frantic woman what dost thou make here Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear Sweet York be patient Hear me gentle liege Rise up good aunt Not yet I thee beseech For ever will I walk upon my knees And never see day that the happy sees Till thou give joy until thou bid me joy By pardoning Rutland my transgressing boy Unto my mother 's prayers I bend my knee Against them both my true joints bended be Pleads he in earnest Look upon his face His eyes do drop no tears his prayers are in jest His words come from his mouth ours from our breast He prays but faintly and would be denied We pray with heart and soul and all beside His weary joints would gladly rise I know Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow His prayers are full of false hypocrisy Ours of true zeal and deep integrity Our prayers do out pray his then let them have That mercy which true prayer ought to have Good aunt stand up do not say ' stand up ' Say ' pardon ' first and afterwards ' stand up ' An if I were thy nurse thy tongue to teach ' Pardon ' should be the first word of thy speech I never long'd to hear a word till now Say ' pardon ' King let pity teach thee how The word is short but not so short as sweet No word like ' pardon ' for kings ' mouths so meet Speak it in French King say ' pardonne moy ' Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy Ah my sour husband my hard hearted lord That sets the word itself against the word Speak ' pardon ' as ' tis current in our land The chopping French we do not understand Thine eye begins to speak set thy tongue there Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce Pity may move thee ' pardon ' to rehearse Good aunt stand up I do not sue to stand Pardon is all the suit I have in hand I pardon him as God shall pardon me O happy vantage of a kneeling knee Yet am I sick for fear Speak it again Twice saying ' pardon ' doth not pardon twain But makes one pardon strong With all my heart I pardon him A god on earth thou art But for our trusty brother in law and the Abbot With all the rest of that consorted crew Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels Good uncle help to order several powers To Oxford or where'er these traitors are They shall not live within this world I swear But I will have them if I once know where Uncle farewell and cousin adieu Your mother well hath pray'd and prove you true Come my old son I pray God make thee new Exeunt Didst thou not mark the King what words he spake ' Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear ' Was it not so These were his very words ' Have I no friend ' quoth he He spake it twice And urg'd it twice together did he not He did And speaking it he wishtly look'd on me As who should say ' I would thou wert the man That would divorce this terror from my heart ' Meaning the King at Pomfret Come let 's go I am the King 's friend and will rid his foe Exeunt I have been studying how I may compare This prison where I live unto the world And for because the world is populous And here is not a creature but myself I can not do it Yet I 'll hammer it out My brain I 'll prove the female to my soul My soul the father and these two beget A generation of still breeding thoughts And these same thoughts people this little world In humours like the people of this world For no thought is contented The better sort As thoughts of things divine are intermix'd With scruples and do set the word itself Against the word As thus ' Come little ones ' and then again ' It is as hard to come as for a camel To thread the postern of a small needle 's eye ' Thoughts tending to ambition they do plot Unlikely wonders how these vain weak nails May tear a passage through the flinty ribs Of this hard world my ragged prison walls And for they can not die in their own pride Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves That they are not the first of fortune 's slaves Nor shall not be the last like silly beggars Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame That many have and others must sit there And in this thought they find a kind of ease Bearing their own misfortunes on the back Of such as have before endur'd the like Thus play I in one person many people And none contented Sometimes am I king Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar And so I am Then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king Then am I king'd again and by and by Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke And straight am nothing But whate'er I be Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd With being nothing The music plays Music do I hear Ha ha keep time How sour sweet music is When time is broke and no proportion kept So is it in the music of men 's lives And here have I the daintiness of ear To check time broke in a disorder'd string But for the concord of my state and time Had not an ear to hear my true time broke I wasted time and now doth time waste me For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock My thoughts are minutes and with sighs they jar Their watches on unto mine eyes the outward watch Whereto my finger like a dial 's point Is pointing still in cleansing them from tears Now sir the sound that tells what hour it is Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart Which is the bell So sighs and tears and groans Show minutes times and hours but my time Runs posting on in Bolingbroke 's proud joy While I stand fooling here his Jack of the clock This music mads me Let it sound no more For though it have holp madmen to their wits In me it seems it will make wise men mad Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me For ' tis a sign of love and love to Richard Is a strange brooch in this all hating world Hail royal Prince Thanks noble peer The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear What art thou and how comest thou hither Where no man never comes but that sad dog That brings me food to make misfortune live I was a poor groom of thy stable King When thou wert king who travelling towards York With much ado at length have gotten leave To look upon my sometimes royal master 's face O how it ern'd my heart when I beheld In London streets that coronation day When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary- That horse that thou so often hast bestrid That horse that I so carefully have dress'd Rode he on Barbary Tell me gentle friend How went he under him So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand This hand hath made him proud with clapping him Would he not stumble would he not fall down Since pride must have a fall and break the neck Of that proud man that did usurp his back Forgiveness horse Why do I rail on thee Since thou created to be aw'd by man Wast born to bear I was not made a horse And yet I bear a burden like an ass Spurr'd gall'd and tir'd by jauncing Bolingbroke Fellow give place here is no longer stay If thou love me ' tis time thou wert away my tongue dares not that my heart shall say My lord will't please you to fall to Taste of it first as thou art wo nt to do My lord I dare not Sir Pierce of Exton Who lately came from the King commands the contrary The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee Patience is stale and I am weary of it Help help help The murderers EXTON and servants rush in armed How now What means death in this rude assault Villain thy own hand yields thy death 's instrument As full of valour as of royal blood Both have I spill'd O would the deed were good For now the devil that told me I did well Says that this deed is chronicled in hell This dead King to the living King I 'll bear Take hence the rest and give them burial here Exeunt Kind uncle York the latest news we hear Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not First to thy sacred state wish I all happiness The next news is I have to London sent The heads of Salisbury Spencer Blunt and Kent The manner of their taking may appear At large discoursed in this paper here We thank thee gentle Percy for thy pains And to thy worth will add right worthy gains My lord I have from Oxford sent to London The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely Two of the dangerous consorted traitors That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow Thy pains Fitzwater shall not be forgot Right noble is thy merit well I wot The grand conspirator Abbot of Westminster With clog of conscience and sour melancholy Hath yielded up his body to the grave But here is Carlisle living to abide Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride Carlisle this is your doom Choose out some secret place some reverend room More than thou hast and with it joy thy life So as thou liv'st in peace die free from strife For though mine enemy thou hast ever been High sparks of honour in thee have I seen Great King within this coffin I present Thy buried fear Herein all breathless lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies Richard of Bordeaux by me hither brought Exton I thank thee not for thou hast wrought A deed of slander with thy fatal hand Upon my head and all this famous land From your own mouth my lord did I this deed They love not poison that do poison need Nor do I thee Though I did wish him dead I hate the murderer love him murdered The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour But neither my good word nor princely favour With Cain go wander thorough shades of night And never show thy head by day nor light Lords I protest my soul is full of woe That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow Come mourn with me for what I do lament And put on sullen black incontinent I 'll make a voyage to the Holy Land To wash this blood off from my guilty hand March sadly after grace my mournings here In weeping after this untimely bier Exeunt Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this sun of York And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house In the deep bosom of the ocean buried Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths Our bruised arms hung up for monuments Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings Our dreadful marches to delightful measures Grim visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front And now instead of mounting barbed steeds To fright the souls of fearful adversaries He capers nimbly in a lady 's chamber To the lascivious pleasing of a lute But I that am not shap'd for sportive tricks Nor made to court an amorous looking glass- I that am rudely stamp'd and want love 's majesty To strut before a wanton ambling nymph- I that am curtail'd of this fair proportion Cheated of feature by dissembling nature Deform'd unfinish'd sent before my time Into this breathing world scarce half made up And that so lamely and unfashionable That dogs bark at me as I halt by them- Why I in this weak piping time of peace Have no delight to pass away the time Unless to spy my shadow in the sun And descant on mine own deformity And therefore since I can not prove a lover To entertain these fair well spoken days I am determined to prove a villain And hate the idle pleasures of these days Plots have I laid inductions dangerous By drunken prophecies libels and dreams To set my brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate the one against the other And if King Edward be as true and just As I am subtle false and treacherous This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up- About a prophecy which says that G Of Edward 's heirs the murderer shall be Dive thoughts down to my soul Here Clarence comes His Majesty Tend'ring my person 's safety hath appointed This conduct to convey me to th ' Tower Upon what cause Because my name is George Alack my lord that fault is none of yours He should for that commit your godfathers O belike his Majesty hath some intent That you should be new christ'ned in the Tower But what 's the matter Clarence May I know Yea Richard when I know for I protest As yet I do not but as I can learn He hearkens after prophecies and dreams And from the cross row plucks the letter G And says a wizard told him that by G His issue disinherited should be And for my name of George begins with G It follows in his thought that I am he These as I learn and such like toys as these Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now Why this it is when men are rul'd by women ' Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower My Lady Grey his wife Clarence ' tis she That tempers him to this extremity Was it not she and that good man of worship Antony Woodville her brother there That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower From whence this present day he is delivered We are not safe Clarence we are not safe By heaven I think there is no man is secure But the Queen 's kindred and night walking heralds That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore Heard you not what an humble suppliant Lord Hastings was for her delivery Humbly complaining to her deity Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty I 'll tell you what I think it is our way If we will keep in favour with the King To be her men and wear her livery The jealous o'er worn widow and herself Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen Are mighty gossips in our monarchy I beseech your Graces both to pardon me His Majesty hath straitly given in charge That no man shall have private conference Of what degree soever with your brother Even so an't please your worship Brakenbury You may partake of any thing we say We speak no treason man we say the King Is wise and virtuous and his noble queen Well struck in years fair and not jealous We say that Shore 's wife hath a pretty foot A cherry lip a bonny eye a passing pleasing tongue And that the Queen 's kindred are made gentlefolks How say you sir Can you deny all this With this my lord myself have naught to do Naught to do with Mistress Shore I tell thee fellow He that doth naught with her excepting one Were best to do it secretly alone What one my lord Her husband knave Wouldst thou betray me I do beseech your Grace to pardon me and withal Forbear your conference with the noble Duke We know thy charge Brakenbury and will obey We are the Queen 's abjects and must obey Brother farewell I will unto the King And whatsoe'er you will employ me in- Were it to call King Edward 's widow sister- I will perform it to enfranchise you Meantime this deep disgrace in brotherhood Touches me deeper than you can imagine I know it pleaseth neither of us well Well your imprisonment shall not be long I will deliver or else lie for you Meantime have patience I must perforce Farewell Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return Simple plain Clarence I do love thee so That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven If heaven will take the present at our hands But who comes here The new delivered Hastings Good time of day unto my gracious lord As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain Well are you welcome to the open air How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment With patience noble lord as prisoners must But I shall live my lord to give them thanks That were the cause of my imprisonment No doubt no doubt and so shall Clarence too For they that were your enemies are his And have prevail'd as much on him as you More pity that the eagles should be mew'd Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty What news abroad No news so bad abroad as this at home The King is sickly weak and melancholy And his physicians fear him mightily Now by Saint John that news is bad indeed O he hath kept an evil diet long And overmuch consum'd his royal person ' Tis very grievous to be thought upon Where is he In his bed He is Go you before and I will follow you Set down set down your honourable load- If honour may be shrouded in a hearse Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament Th ' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster Poor key cold figure of a holy king Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost To hear the lamentations of poor Anne Wife to thy Edward to thy slaughtered son Stabb'd by the self same hand that made these wounds Lo in these windows that let forth thy life I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes O cursed be the hand that made these holes Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence More direful hap betide that hated wretch That makes us wretched by the death of thee Than I can wish to adders spiders toads Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives If ever he have child abortive be it Prodigious and untimely brought to light Whose ugly and unnatural aspect May fright the hopeful mother at the view And that be heir to his unhappiness If ever he have wife let her be made More miserable by the death of him Than I am made by my young lord and thee Come now towards Chertsey with your holy load Taken from Paul 's to be interred there And still as you are weary of this weight Rest you whiles I lament King Henry 's corse Stay you that bear the corse and set it down What black magician conjures up this fiend To stop devoted charitable deeds Villains set down the corse or by Saint Paul I 'll make a corse of him that disobeys My lord stand back and let the coffin pass Unmannerd dog Stand thou when I command Advance thy halberd higher than my breast Or by Saint Paul I 'll strike thee to my foot And spurn upon thee beggar for thy boldness What do you tremble Are you all afraid Alas I blame you not for you are mortal And mortal eyes can not endure the devil Avaunt thou dreadful minister of hell Thou hadst but power over his mortal body His soul thou canst not have therefore be gone Sweet saint for charity be not so curst Foul devil for God 's sake hence and trouble us not For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds Behold this pattern of thy butcheries O gentlemen see see Dead Henry 's wounds Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh Blush blush thou lump of foul deformity For ' tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural Provokes this deluge most unnatural O God which this blood mad'st revenge his death O earth which this blood drink'st revenge his death Either heav'n with lightning strike the murd'rer dead Or earth gape open wide and eat him quick As thou dost swallow up this good king 's blood Which his hell govern'd arm hath butchered Lady you know no rules of charity Which renders good for bad blessings for curses Villain thou knowest nor law of God nor man No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity But I know none and therefore am no beast O wonderful when devils tell the truth More wonderful when angels are so angry Vouchsafe divine perfection of a woman Of these supposed crimes to give me leave By circumstance but to acquit myself Vouchsafe diffus'd infection of a man Of these known evils but to give me leave By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self Fairer than tongue can name thee let me have Some patient leisure to excuse myself Fouler than heart can think thee thou canst make No excuse current but to hang thyself By such despair I should accuse myself And by despairing shalt thou stand excused For doing worthy vengeance on thyself That didst unworthy slaughter upon others Say that I slew them not Then say they were not slain But dead they are and devilish slave by thee I did not kill your husband Why then he is alive Nay he is dead and slain by Edward 's hands In thy foul throat thou liest Queen Margaret saw Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood The which thou once didst bend against her breast But that thy brothers beat aside the point I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind That never dream'st on aught but butcheries Didst thou not kill this king I grant ye Dost grant me hedgehog Then God grant me to Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed O he was gentle mild and virtuous The better for the King of Heaven that hath him He is in heaven where thou shalt never come Let him thank me that holp to send him thither For he was fitter for that place than earth And thou unfit for any place but hell Yes one place else if you will hear me name it Some dungeon Your bed chamber Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest So will it madam till I lie with you I hope so I know so But gentle Lady Anne To leave this keen encounter of our wits And fall something into a slower method- Is not the causer of the timeless deaths Of these Plantagenets Henry and Edward As blameful as the executioner Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect Your beauty was the cause of that effect- Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep To undertake the death of all the world So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom If I thought that I tell thee homicide These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks These eyes could not endure that beauty 's wreck You should not blemish it if I stood by As all the world is cheered by the sun So I by that it is my day my life Black night o'ershade thy day and death thy life Curse not thyself fair creature thou art both I would I were to be reveng'd on thee It is a quarrel most unnatural To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee It is a quarrel just and reasonable To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband He that bereft thee lady of thy husband Did it to help thee to a better husband His better doth not breathe upon the earth He lives that loves thee better than he could Name him Plantagenet Why that was he The self same name but one of better nature Where is he Here She spits at him Why dost thou spit at me Would it were mortal poison for thy sake Never came poison from so sweet a place Never hung poison on a fouler toad Out of my sight Thou dost infect mine eyes Thine eyes sweet lady have infected mine Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead I would they were that I might die at once For now they kill me with a living death Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops- These eyes which never shed remorseful tear No when my father York and Edward wept To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made When black fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him Nor when thy warlike father like a child Told the sad story of my father 's death And twenty times made pause to sob and weep That all the standers by had wet their cheeks Like trees bedash'd with rain in that sad time My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear And what these sorrows could not thence exhale Thy beauty hath and made them blind with weeping I never sued to friend nor enemy My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word But now thy beauty is propos'd my fee My proud heart sues and prompts my tongue to speak Arise dissembler though I wish thy death I will not be thy executioner Then bid me kill myself and I will do it I have already That was in thy rage Speak it again and even with the word This hand which for thy love did kill thy love Shall for thy love kill a far truer love To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary I would I knew thy heart ' Tis figur'd in my tongue I fear me both are false Then never was man true well put up your sword Say then my peace is made That shalt thou know hereafter But shall I live in hope All men I hope live so Vouchsafe to wear this ring To take is not to give Puts on the ring Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart Wear both of them for both of them are thine And if thy poor devoted servant may But beg one favour at thy gracious hand Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever What is it That it may please you leave these sad designs To him that hath most cause to be a mourner And presently repair to Crosby House Where after I have solemnly interr'd At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king And wet his grave with my repentant tears- I will with all expedient duty see you For divers unknown reasons I beseech you Grant me this boon With all my heart and much it joys me too To see you are become so penitent Tressel and Berkeley go along with me Bid me farewell ' Tis more than you deserve But since you teach me how to flatter you Imagine I have said farewell already Sirs take up the corse Towards Chertsey noble lord No to White Friars there attend my coming Have patience madam there 's no doubt his Majesty Will soon recover his accustom'd health In that you brook it ill it makes him worse Therefore for God 's sake entertain good comfort And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes If he were dead what would betide on me No other harm but loss of such a lord The loss of such a lord includes all harms The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son To be your comforter when he is gone Ah he is young and his minority Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester A man that loves not me nor none of you Is it concluded he shall be Protector It is determin'd not concluded yet But so it must be if the King miscarry Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby Good time of day unto your royal Grace God make your Majesty joyful as you have been The Countess Richmond good my Lord of Derby To your good prayer will scarcely say amen Yet Derby notwithstanding she 's your wife And loves not me be you good lord assur'd I hate not you for her proud arrogance I do beseech you either not believe The envious slanders of her false accusers Or if she be accus'd on true report Bear with her weakness which I think proceeds From wayward sickness and no grounded malice Saw you the King to day my Lord of Derby But now the Duke of Buckingham and I Are come from visiting his Majesty What likelihood of his amendment Lords Madam good hope his Grace speaks cheerfully God grant him health Did you confer with him Ay madam he desires to make atonement Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers And between them and my Lord Chamberlain And sent to warn them to his royal presence Would all were well But that will never be I fear our happiness is at the height They do me wrong and I will not endure it Who is it that complains unto the King That I forsooth am stern and love them not By holy Paul they love his Grace but lightly That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours Because I can not flatter and look fair Smile in men 's faces smooth deceive and cog Duck with French nods and apish courtesy I must be held a rancorous enemy Can not a plain man live and think no harm But thus his simple truth must be abus'd With silken sly insinuating Jacks To who in all this presence speaks your Grace To thee that hast nor honesty nor grace When have I injur'd thee when done thee wrong Or thee or thee or any of your faction A plague upon you all His royal Grace- Whom God preserve better than you would wish!- Can not be quiet searce a breathing while But you must trouble him with lewd complaints Brother of Gloucester you mistake the matter The King on his own royal disposition And not provok'd by any suitor else- Aiming belike at your interior hatred That in your outward action shows itself Against my children brothers and myself- Makes him to send that he may learn the ground I can not tell the world is grown so bad That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch Since every Jack became a gentleman There 's many a gentle person made a Jack Come come we know your meaning brother Gloucester You envy my advancement and my friends ' God grant we never may have need of you Meantime God grants that I have need of you Our brother is imprison'd by your means Myself disgrac'd and the nobility Held in contempt while great promotions Are daily given to ennoble those That scarce some two days since were worth a noble By Him that rais'd me to this careful height From that contented hap which I enjoy'd I never did incense his Majesty Against the Duke of Clarence but have been An earnest advocate to plead for him My lord you do me shameful injury Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects You may deny that you were not the mean Of my Lord Hastings ' late imprisonment She may my lord for- She may Lord Rivers Why who knows not so She may do more sir than denying that She may help you to many fair preferments And then deny her aiding hand therein And lay those honours on your high desert What may she not She may ay marry may she- What marry may she What marry may she Marry with a king A bachelor and a handsome stripling too Iwis your grandam had a worser match My Lord of Gloucester I have too long borne Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs By heaven I will acquaint his Majesty Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd I had rather be a country servant maid Than a great queen with this condition- To be so baited scorn'd and stormed at And less'ned be that small God I beseech Him Thy honour state and seat is due to me What Threat you me with telling of the King Tell him and spare not Look what I have said I will avouch't in presence of the King I dare adventure to be sent to th ' Tow'r ' Tis time to speak my pains are quite forgot Out devil I do remember them to well Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower And Edward my poor son at Tewksbury Ere you were queen ay or your husband King I was a pack horse in his great affairs A weeder out of his proud adversaries A liberal rewarder of his friends To royalize his blood I spent mine own Ay and much better blood than his or thine In all which time you and your husband Grey Were factious for the house of Lancaster And Rivers so were you Was not your husband In Margaret 's battle at Saint Albans slain Let me put in your minds if you forget What you have been ere this and what you are Withal what I have been and what I am A murd'rous villain and so still thou art Poor Clarence did forsake his father Warwick Ay and forswore himself which Jesu pardon!- Which God revenge To fight on Edward 's party for the crown And for his meed poor lord he is mewed up I would to God my heart were flint like Edward 's Or Edward 's soft and pitiful like mine I am too childish foolish for this world Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this world Thou cacodemon there thy kingdom is My Lord of Gloucester in those busy days Which here you urge to prove us enemies We follow'd then our lord our sovereign king So should we you if you should be our king If I should be I had rather be a pedlar Far be it from my heart the thought thereof As little joy my lord as you suppose You should enjoy were you this country 's king As little joy you may suppose in me That I enjoy being the Queen thereof As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof For I am she and altogether joyless I can no longer hold me patient Advancing Hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out In sharing that which you have pill'd from me Which of you trembles not that looks on me If not that I am Queen you bow like subjects Yet that by you depos'd you quake like rebels Ah gentle villain do not turn away Foul wrinkled witch what mak'st thou in my sight But repetition of what thou hast marr'd That will I make before I let thee go Wert thou not banished on pain of death I was but I do find more pain in banishment Than death can yield me here by my abode A husband and a son thou ow'st to me And thou a kingdom all of you allegiance This sorrow that I have by right is yours And all the pleasures you usurp are mine The curse my noble father laid on thee When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland- His curses then from bitterness of soul Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee And God not we hath plagu'd thy bloody deed So just is God to right the innocent O ' twas the foulest deed to slay that babe And the most merciless that e'er was heard of Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported No man but prophesied revenge for it Northumberland then present wept to see it What were you snarling all before I came Ready to catch each other by the throat And turn you all your hatred now on me Did York 's dread curse prevail so much with heaven That Henry 's death my lovely Edward 's death Their kingdom 's loss my woeful banishment Should all but answer for that peevish brat Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven Why then give way dull clouds to my quick curses Though not by war by surfeit die your king As ours by murder to make him a king Edward thy son that now is Prince of Wales For Edward our son that was Prince of Wales Die in his youth by like untimely violence Thyself a queen for me that was a queen Outlive thy glory like my wretched self Long mayest thou live to wail thy children 's death And see another as I see thee now Deck'd in thy rights as thou art stall'd in mine Long die thy happy days before thy death And after many length'ned hours of grief Die neither mother wife nor England 's Queen Rivers and Dorset you were standers by And so wast thou Lord Hastings when my son Was stabb'd with bloody daggers God I pray him That none of you may live his natural age But by some unlook'd accident cut off Have done thy charm thou hateful wither'd hag And leave out thee Stay dog for thou shalt hear me If heaven have any grievous plague in store Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee O let them keep it till thy sins be ripe And then hurl down their indignation On thee the troubler of the poor world 's peace The worm of conscience still be gnaw thy soul Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine Unless it be while some tormenting dream Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils Thou elvish mark'd abortive rooting hog Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity The slave of nature and the son of hell Thou slander of thy heavy mother 's womb Thou loathed issue of thy father 's loins Thou rag of honour thou detested- Margaret Richard Ha I call thee not I cry thee mercy then for I did think That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names Why so I did but look'd for no reply O let me make the period to my curse ' Tis done by me and ends in Margaret Thus have you breath'd your curse against yourself Poor painted queen vain flourish of my fortune Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about Fool fool thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself The day will come that thou shalt wish for me To help thee curse this poisonous bunch back'd toad False boding woman end thy frantic curse Lest to thy harm thou move our patience Foul shame upon you you have all mov'd mine Were you well serv'd you would be taught your To serve me well you all should do me duty Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects O serve me well and teach yourselves that duty Dispute not with her she is lunatic Peace Master Marquis you are malapert Your fire new stamp of honour is scarce current O that your young nobility could judge What ' twere to lose it and be miserable They that stand high have many blasts to shake them And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces Good counsel marry learn it learn it Marquis It touches you my lord as much as me Ay and much more but I was born so high Our aery buildeth in the cedar 's top And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun And turns the sun to shade alas alas Witness my son now in the shade of death Whose bright out shining beams thy cloudy wrath Hath in eternal darkness folded up Your aery buildeth in our aery 's nest O God that seest it do not suffer it As it is won with blood lost be it so Peace peace for shame if not for charity Urge neither charity nor shame to me Uncharitably with me have you dealt And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd My charity is outrage life my shame And in that shame still live my sorrow 's rage Have done have done O princely Buckingham I 'll kiss thy hand In sign of league and amity with thee Now fair befall thee and thy noble house Thy garments are not spotted with our blood Nor thou within the compass of my curse Nor no one here for curses never pass The lips of those that breathe them in the air I will not think but they ascend the sky And there awake God 's gentle sleeping peace O Buckingham take heed of yonder dog Look when he fawns he bites and when he bites His venom tooth will rankle to the death Have not to do with him beware of him Sin death and hell have set their marks on him And all their ministers attend on him What doth she say my Lord of Buckingham Nothing that I respect my gracious lord What dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel And soothe the devil that I warn thee from O but remember this another day When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow And say poor Margaret was a prophetess Live each of you the subjects to his hate And he to yours and all of you to God 's Exit My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses And so doth mine I muse why she 's at liberty I can not blame her by God 's holy Mother She hath had too much wrong and I repent My part thereof that I have done to her I never did her any to my knowledge Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong I was too hot to do somebody good That is too cold in thinking of it now Marry as for Clarence he is well repaid He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains God pardon them that are the cause thereof A virtuous and a Christian like conclusion To pray for them that have done scathe to us So do I ever- Aside being well advis'd For had I curs'd now I had curs'd myself Madam his Majesty doth can for you And for your Grace and you my gracious lords Catesby I come Lords will you go with me We wait upon your Grace I do the wrong and first begin to brawl The secret mischiefs that I set abroach I lay unto the grievous charge of others Clarence who I indeed have cast in darkness I do beweep to many simple gulls Namely to Derby Hastings Buckingham And tell them ' tis the Queen and her allies That stir the King against the Duke my brother Now they believe it and withal whet me To be reveng'd on Rivers Dorset Grey But then I sigh and with a piece of Scripture Tell them that God bids us do good for evil And thus I clothe my naked villainy With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ And seem a saint when most I play the devil We are my lord and come to have the warrant That we may be admitted where he is Well thought upon I have it here about me Tut tut my lord we will not stand to prate Talkers are no good doers Be assur'd We go to use our hands and not our tongues Your eyes drop millstones when fools ' eyes fall tears I like you lads about your business straight Go go dispatch We will my noble lord Exeunt Why looks your Grace so heavily to day O I have pass'd a miserable night So full of fearful dreams of ugly sights That as I am a Christian faithful man I would not spend another such a night Though ' twere to buy a world of happy days- So full of dismal terror was the time What was your dream my lord I pray you tell me Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy And in my company my brother Gloucester Who from my cabin tempted me to walk Upon the hatches Thence we look'd toward England And cited up a thousand heavy times During the wars of York and Lancaster That had befall'n us As we pac'd along Upon the giddy footing of the hatches Methought that Gloucester stumbled and in falling Struck me that thought to stay him overboard Into the tumbling billows of the main O Lord methought what pain it was to drown What dreadful noise of waters in my ears What sights of ugly death within my eyes Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon Wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl Inestimable stones unvalued jewels All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea Some lay in dead men 's skulls and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept As ' twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by Had you such leisure in the time of death To gaze upon these secrets of the deep Methought I had and often did I strive To yield the ghost but still the envious flood Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth To find the empty vast and wand'ring air But smother'd it within my panting bulk Who almost burst to belch it in the sea Awak'd you not in this sore agony No no my dream was lengthen'd after life O then began the tempest to my soul I pass'd methought the melancholy flood With that sour ferryman which poets write of Unto the kingdom of perpetual night The first that there did greet my stranger soul Was my great father in law renowned Warwick Who spake aloud ' What scourge for perjury Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence ' And so he vanish'd Then came wand'ring by A shadow like an angel with bright hair Dabbled in blood and he shriek'd out aloud ' Clarence is come false fleeting perjur'd Clarence That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury Seize on him Furies take him unto torment ' With that methoughts a legion of foul fiends Environ'd me and howled in mine ears Such hideous cries that with the very noise I trembling wak'd and for a season after Could not believe but that I was in hell Such terrible impression made my dream No marvel lord though it affrighted you I am afraid methinks to hear you tell it Ah Keeper Keeper I have done these things That now give evidence against my soul For Edward 's sake and see how he requites me O God If my deep prayers can not appease Thee But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone O spare my guiltless wife and my poor children I will my lord God give your Grace good rest Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours Makes the night morning and the noontide night Princes have but their titles for their glories An outward honour for an inward toil And for unfelt imaginations They often feel a world of restless cares So that between their tides and low name There 's nothing differs but the outward fame Ho who 's here What wouldst thou fellow and how cam'st thou hither I would speak with Clarence and I came hither on my legs What so brief ' Tis better sir than to be tedious Let him see our commission and talk no more I am in this commanded to deliver The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands I will not reason what is meant hereby Because I will be guiltless from the meaning There lies the Duke asleep and there the keys I 'll to the King and signify to him That thus I have resign'd to you my charge You may sir ' tis a point of wisdom Fare you well Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER What shall I stab him as he sleeps No he 'll say ' twas done cowardly when he wakes Why he shall never wake until the great judgment day Why then he 'll say we stabb'd him sleeping The urging of that word judgment hath bred a kind of remorse in me What art thou afraid Not to kill him having a warrant but to be damn'd for killing him from the which no warrant can defend me I thought thou hadst been resolute So I am to let him live I 'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and tell him so Nay I prithee stay a little I hope this passionate humour of mine will change it was wo nt to hold me but while one tells twenty How dost thou feel thyself now SECOND MURDERER Faith some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me Remember our reward when the deed 's done Zounds he dies I had forgot the reward Where 's thy conscience now O in the Duke of Gloucester 's purse When he opens his purse to give us our reward thy conscience flies out ' Tis no matter let it go there 's few or none will entertain it What if it come to thee again I 'll not meddle with it it makes a man coward a man can not steal but it accuseth him a man can not swear but it checks him a man can not lie with his neighbour 's wife but it detects him ' Tis a blushing shame- fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man 's bosom it fills a man full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that by chance I found It beggars any man that keeps it It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and live without it Zounds ' tis even now at my elbow persuading me not to kill the Duke Take the devil in thy mind and believe him not he would insinuate with thee but to make the sigh I am strong fram'd he can not prevail with me Spoke like a tall man that respects thy reputation Come shall we fall to work Take him on the costard with the hilts of thy sword and then chop him in the malmsey butt in the next room O excellent device and make a sop of him Soft he wakes Strike No we 'll reason with him Where art thou Keeper Give me a cup of wine You shall have wine enough my lord anon In God 's name what art thou A man as you are But not as I am royal Nor you as we are loyal Thy voice is thunder but thy looks are humble My voice is now the King 's my looks mine own How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak Your eyes do menace me Why look you pale Who sent you hither Wherefore do you come To to to- To murder me Ay ay You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so And therefore can not have the hearts to do it Wherein my friends have I offended you Offended us you have not but the King I shall be reconcil'd to him again Never my lord therefore prepare to die Are you drawn forth among a world of men To slay the innocent What is my offence Where is the evidence that doth accuse me What lawful quest have given their verdict up Unto the frowning judge or who pronounc'd The bitter sentence of poor Clarence ' death Before I be convict by course of law To threaten me with death is most unlawful I charge you as you hope to have redemption By Christ 's dear blood shed for our grievous sins That you depart and lay no hands on me The deed you undertake is damnable What we will do we do upon command And he that hath commanded is our King Erroneous vassals the great King of kings Hath in the tables of his law commanded That thou shalt do no murder Will you then Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man 's Take heed for he holds vengeance in his hand To hurl upon their heads that break his law And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee For false forswearing and for murder too Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight In quarrel of the house of Lancaster And like a traitor to the name of God Didst break that vow and with thy treacherous blade Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign 's son Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and defend How canst thou urge God 's dreadful law to us When thou hast broke it in such dear degree Alas for whose sake did I that ill deed For Edward for my brother for his sake He sends you not to murder me for this For in that sin he is as deep as I. If God will be avenged for the deed O know you yet He doth it publicly Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm He needs no indirect or lawless course To cut off those that have offended Him Who made thee then a bloody minister When gallant springing brave Plantagenet That princely novice was struck dead by thee My brother 's love the devil and my rage Thy brother 's love our duty and thy faults Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee If you do love my brother hate not me I am his brother and I love him well If you are hir'd for meed go back again And I will send you to my brother Gloucester Who shall reward you better for my life Than Edward will for tidings of my death You are deceiv'd your brother Gloucester hates you O no he loves me and he holds me dear Go you to him from me Ay so we will Tell him when that our princely father York Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm And charg'd us from his soul to love each other He little thought of this divided friendship Bid Gloucester think of this and he will weep Ay millstones as he lesson'd us to weep O do not slander him for he is kind Right as snow in harvest Come you deceive yourself ' Tis he that sends us to destroy you here CLARENCE It can not be for he bewept my fortune And hugg'd me in his arms and swore with sobs That he would labour my delivery Why so he doth when he delivers you From this earth 's thraldom to the joys of heaven Make peace with God for you must die my lord Have you that holy feeling in your souls To counsel me to make my peace with God And are you yet to your own souls so blind That you will war with God by murd'ring me O sirs consider they that set you on To do this deed will hate you for the deed What shall we do Relent and save your souls Relent No ' tis cowardly and womanish Not to relent is beastly savage devilish Which of you if you were a prince 's son Being pent from liberty as I am now If two such murderers as yourselves came to you Would not entreat for life My friend I spy some pity in thy looks O if thine eye be not a flatterer Come thou on my side and entreat for me- As you would beg were you in my distress A begging prince what beggar pities not Look behind you my lord Stabbing him Take that and that If all this will not do I 'll drown you in the malmsey butt within A bloody deed and desperately dispatch'd How fain like Pilate would I wash my hands Of this most grievous murder I would he knew that I had sav'd his brother Take thou the fee and tell him what I say For I repent me that the Duke is slain Exit So do not I. Go coward as thou art Well I 'll go hide the body in some hole Till that the Duke give order for his burial And when I have my meed I will away For this will out and then I must not stay Exit Why so Now have I done a good day 's work You peers continue this united league I every day expect an embassage From my Redeemer to redeem me hence And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven Since I have made my friends at peace on earth Hastings and Rivers take each other 's hand Dissemble not your hatred swear your love By heaven my soul is purg'd from grudging hate And with my hand I seal my true heart 's love So thrive I as I truly swear the like Take heed you dally not before your king Lest He that is the supreme King of kings Confound your hidden falsehood and award Either of you to be the other 's end So prosper I as I swear perfect love And I as I love Hastings with my heart Madam yourself is not exempt from this Nor you son Dorset Buckingham nor you You have been factious one against the other Wife love Lord Hastings let him kiss your hand And what you do do it unfeignedly There Hastings I will never more remember Our former hatred so thrive I and mine Dorset embrace him Hastings love Lord Marquis This interchange of love I here protest Upon my part shall be inviolable And so swear I. They embrace Now princely Buckingham seal thou this league With thy embracements to my wife 's allies And make me happy in your unity To the QUEEN Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate Upon your Grace but with all duteous love Doth cherish you and yours God punish me With hate in those where I expect most love When I have most need to employ a friend And most assured that he is a friend Deep hollow treacherous and full of guile Be he unto me This do I beg of God When I am cold in love to you or yours A pleasing cordial princely Buckingham Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here To make the blessed period of this peace And in good time Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke Good morrow to my sovereign king and Queen And princely peers a happy time of day Happy indeed as we have spent the day Gloucester we have done deeds of charity Made peace of enmity fair love of hate Between these swelling wrong incensed peers A blessed labour my most sovereign lord Among this princely heap if any here By false intelligence or wrong surmise Hold me a foe- If I unwittingly or in my rage Have aught committed that is hardly borne To any in this presence I desire To reconcile me to his friendly peace ' Tis death to me to be at enmity I hate it and desire all good men 's love First madam I entreat true peace of you Which I will purchase with my duteous service Of you my noble cousin Buckingham If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us Of you and you Lord Rivers and of Dorset That all without desert have frown'd on me Of you Lord Woodville and Lord Scales of you Dukes earls lords gentlemen indeed of all I do not know that Englishman alive With whom my soul is any jot at odds More than the infant that is born to night I thank my God for my humility A holy day shall this be kept hereafter I would to God all strifes were well compounded My sovereign lord I do beseech your Highness To take our brother Clarence to your grace Why madam have I off'red love for this To be so flouted in this royal presence Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead Who knows not he is dead Who knows he is All seeing heaven what a world is this Look I so pale Lord Dorset as the rest Ay my good lord and no man in the presence But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks Is Clarence dead The order was revers'd But he poor man by your first order died And that a winged Mercury did bear Some tardy cripple bare the countermand That came too lag to see him buried God grant that some less noble and less loyal Nearer in bloody thoughts an not in blood Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did And yet go current from suspicion A boon my sovereign for my service done I prithee peace my soul is full of sorrow I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me Then say at once what is it thou requests The forfeit sovereign of my servant 's life Who slew to day a riotous gentleman Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk Have I a tongue to doom my brother 's death And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave My brother killed no man his fault was thought And yet his punishment was bitter death Who sued to me for him Who in my wrath Kneel'd at my feet and bid me be advis'd Who spoke of brotherhood Who spoke of love Who told me how the poor soul did forsake The mighty Warwick and did fight for me Who told me in the field at Tewksbury When Oxford had me down he rescued me And said ' Dear Brother live and be a king ' Who told me when we both lay in the field Frozen almost to death how he did lap me Even in his garments and did give himself All thin and naked to the numb cold night All this from my remembrance brutish wrath Sinfully pluck'd and not a man of you Had so much race to put it in my mind But when your carters or your waiting vassals Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd The precious image of our dear Redeemer You straight are on your knees for pardon pardon And I unjustly too must grant it you DERBY rises But for my brother not a man would speak Nor I ungracious speak unto myself For him poor soul The proudest of you all Have been beholding to him in his life Yet none of you would once beg for his life O God I fear thy justice will take hold On me and you and mine and yours for this Come Hastings help me to my closet Ah poor Clarence This is the fruits of rashness Mark'd you not How that the guilty kindred of the Queen Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence ' death O they did urge it still unto the King God will revenge it Come lords will you go To comfort Edward with our company We wait upon your Grace Exeunt Good grandam tell us is our father dead No boy Why do you weep so oft and beat your breast And cry ' O Clarence my unhappy son ' Why do you look on us and shake your head And call us orphans wretches castaways If that our noble father were alive My pretty cousins you mistake me both I do lament the sickness of the King As loath to lose him not your father 's death It were lost sorrow to wail one that 's lost Then you conclude my grandam he is dead The King mine uncle is to blame for it God will revenge it whom I will importune With earnest prayers all to that effect And so will I. Peace children peace The King doth love you well Incapable and shallow innocents You can not guess who caus'd your father 's death Grandam we can for my good uncle Gloucester Told me the King provok'd to it by the Queen Devis'd impeachments to imprison him And when my uncle told me so he wept And pitied me and kindly kiss'd my cheek Bade me rely on him as on my father And he would love me dearly as a child Ah that deceit should steal such gentle shape And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice He is my son ay and therein my shame Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit Think you my uncle did dissemble grandam Ay boy I can not think it Hark what noise is this Ah who shall hinder me to wail and weep To chide my fortune and torment myself I 'll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy What means this scene of rude impatience To make an act of tragic violence Ah so much interest have I in thy sorrow As I had title in thy noble husband I have bewept a worthy husband 's death And liv'd with looking on his images But now two mirrors of his princely semblance Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death And I for comfort have but one false glass That grieves me when I see my shame in him Thou art a widow yet thou art a mother And hast the comfort of thy children left But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands- Clarence and Edward O what cause have I- Thine being but a moiety of my moan- To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries Ah aunt you wept not for our father 's death How can we aid you with our kindred tears Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd Your widow dolour likewise be unwept Give me no help in lamentation I am not barren to bring forth complaints All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes That I being govern'd by the watery moon May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world Ah for my husband for my dear Lord Edward Ah for our father for our dear Lord Clarence Alas for both both mine Edward and Clarence What stay had I but Edward and he 's gone What stay had we but Clarence and he 's gone What stays had I but they and they are gone Was never widow had so dear a loss Were never orphans had so dear a loss Was never mother had so dear a loss Alas I am the mother of these griefs Their woes are parcell'd mine is general She for an Edward weeps and so do I I for a Clarence weep so doth not she These babes for Clarence weep and so do I I for an Edward weep so do not they Alas you three on me threefold distress'd Pour all your tears I am your sorrow 's nurse And I will pamper it with lamentation Comfort dear mother God is much displeas'd That you take with unthankfulness his doing In common worldly things ' tis called ungrateful With dull unwillingness to repay a debt Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent Much more to be thus opposite with heaven For it requires the royal debt it lent you Madam bethink you like a careful mother Of the young prince your son Send straight for him Let him be crown'd in him your comfort lives Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward 's grave And plant your joys in living Edward 's throne Sister have comfort All of us have cause To wail the dimming of our shining star But none can help our harms by wailing them Madam my mother I do cry you mercy I did not see your Grace Humbly on my knee I crave your blessing God bless thee and put meekness in thy breast Love charity obedience and true duty Amen Aside And make me die a good old man That is the butt end of a mother 's blessing I marvel that her Grace did leave it out You cloudy princes and heart sorrowing peers That bear this heavy mutual load of moan Now cheer each other in each other 's love Though we have spent our harvest of this king We are to reap the harvest of his son The broken rancour of your high swol'n hearts But lately splinter'd knit and join'd together Must gently be preserv'd cherish'd and kept Me seemeth good that with some little train Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet Hither to London to be crown'd our King Marry my lord lest by a multitude The new heal'd wound of malice should break out Which would be so much the more dangerous By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd Where every horse bears his commanding rein And may direct his course as please himself As well the fear of harm as harm apparent In my opinion ought to be prevented I hope the King made peace with all of us And the compact is firm and true in me And so in me and so I think in an Yet since it is but green it should be put To no apparent likelihood of breach Which haply by much company might be urg'd Therefore I say with noble Buckingham That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince And so say I. Then be it so and go we to determine Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow Madam and you my sister will you go To give your censures in this business My lord whoever journeys to the Prince For God sake let not us two stay at home For by the way I 'll sort occasion As index to the story we late talk'd of To part the Queen 's proud kindred from the Prince My other self my counsel 's consistory My oracle my prophet my dear cousin I as a child will go by thy direction Toward Ludlow then for we 'll not stay behind Exeunt Good morrow neighbour Whither away so fast I promise you I scarcely know myself Hear you the news abroad Yes that the King is dead Ill news by'r lady seldom comes the better I fear I fear ' twill prove a giddy world Neighbours God speed Give you good morrow sir Doth the news hold of good King Edward 's death Ay sir it is too true God help the while Then masters look to see a troublous world No no by God 's good grace his son shall reign Woe to that land that 's govern'd by a child In him there is a hope of government Which in his nonage council under him And in his full and ripened years himself No doubt shall then and till then govern well So stood the state when Henry the Sixth Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old Stood the state so No no good friends God wot For then this land was famously enrich'd With politic grave counsel then the King Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace Why so hath this both by his father and mother Better it were they all came by his father Or by his father there were none at all For emulation who shall now be nearest Will touch us all too near if God prevent not O full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester And the Queen 's sons and brothers haught and proud And were they to be rul'd and not to rule This sickly land might solace as before Come come we fear the worst all will be well When clouds are seen wise men put on their cloaks When great leaves fall then winter is at hand When the sun sets who doth not look for night Untimely storms make men expect a dearth All may be well but if God sort it so ' Tis more than we deserve or I expect Truly the hearts of men are fun of fear You can not reason almost with a man That looks not heavily and fun of dread Before the days of change still is it so By a divine instinct men 's minds mistrust Ensuing danger as by proof we see The water swell before a boist'rous storm But leave it all to God Whither away Marry we were sent for to the justices And so was I I 'll bear you company Last night I hear they lay at Stony Stratford And at Northampton they do rest to night To morrow or next day they will be here I long with all my heart to see the Prince I hope he is much grown since last I saw him But I hear no they say my son of York Has almost overta'en him in his growth Ay mother but I would not have it so Why my good cousin it is good to grow Grandam one night as we did sit at supper My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow More than my brother ' Ay ' quoth my uncle Gloucester ' Small herbs have grace great weeds do grow apace ' And since methinks I would not grow so fast Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste Good faith good faith the saying did not hold In him that did object the same to thee He was the wretched'st thing when he was young So long a growing and so leisurely That if his rule were true he should be gracious And so no doubt he is my gracious madam I hope he is but yet let mothers doubt Now by my troth if I had been rememb'red I could have given my uncle 's Grace a flout To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine How my young York I prithee let me hear it Marry they say my uncle grew so fast That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old ' Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth Grandam this would have been a biting jest I prithee pretty York who told thee this Grandam his nurse His nurse Why she was dead ere thou wast born If ' twere not she I can not tell who told me A parlous boy Go to you are too shrewd Good madam be not angry with the child Pitchers have ears Here comes a messenger What news Such news my lord as grieves me to report How doth the Prince Well madam and in health What is thy news Lord Rivers and Lord Grey Are sent to Pomfret and with them Sir Thomas Vaughan prisoners Who hath committed them The mighty Dukes Gloucester and Buckingham For what offence The sum of all I can I have disclos'd Why or for what the nobles were committed Is all unknown to me my gracious lord Ay me I see the ruin of my house The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind Insulting tyranny begins to jet Upon the innocent and aweless throne Welcome destruction blood and massacre I see as in a map the end of all Accursed and unquiet wrangling days How many of you have mine eyes beheld My husband lost his life to get the crown And often up and down my sons were toss'd For me to joy and weep their gain and loss And being seated and domestic broils Clean over blown themselves the conquerors Make war upon themselves brother to brother Blood to blood self against self O preposterous And frantic outrage end thy damned spleen Or let me die to look on death no more Come come my boy we will to sanctuary Madam farewell Stay I will go with you You have no cause To the QUEEN My gracious lady go And thither bear your treasure and your goods For my part I 'll resign unto your Grace The seal I keep and so betide to me As well I tender you and all of yours Go I 'll conduct you to the sanctuary Exeunt Welcome sweet Prince to London to your chamber Welcome dear cousin my thoughts ' sovereign The weary way hath made you melancholy No uncle but our crosses on the way Have made it tedious wearisome and heavy I want more uncles here to welcome me Sweet Prince the untainted virtue of your years Hath not yet div'd into the world 's deceit Nor more can you distinguish of a man Than of his outward show which God He knows Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart Those uncles which you want were dangerous Your Grace attended to their sug'red words But look'd not on the poison of their hearts God keep you from them and from such false friends God keep me from false friends but they were none My lord the Mayor of London comes to greet you God bless your Grace with health and happy days I thank you good my lord and thank you all I thought my mother and my brother York Would long ere this have met us on the way Fie what a slug is Hastings that he comes not To tell us whether they will come or no And in good time here comes the sweating Lord Welcome my lord What will our mother come On what occasion God He knows not I The Queen your mother and your brother York Have taken sanctuary The tender Prince Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace But by his mother was perforce withheld Fie what an indirect and peevish course Is this of hers Lord Cardinal will your Grace Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York Unto his princely brother presently If she deny Lord Hastings go with him And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce My Lord of Buckingham if my weak oratory Can from his mother win the Duke of York Anon expect him here but if she be obdurate To mild entreaties God in heaven forbid We should infringe the holy privilege Of blessed sanctuary Not for all this land Would I be guilty of so deep a sin You are too senseless obstinate my lord Too ceremonious and traditional Weigh it but with the grossness of this age You break not sanctuary in seizing him The benefit thereof is always granted To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place And those who have the wit to claim the place This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it And therefore in mine opinion can not have it Then taking him from thence that is not there You break no privilege nor charter there Oft have I heard of sanctuary men But sanctuary children never till now My lord you shall o'errule my mind for once Come on Lord Hastings will you go with me I go my lord Good lords make all the speedy haste you may Where it seems best unto your royal self If I may counsel you some day or two Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower Then where you please and shall be thought most fit For your best health and recreation I do not like the Tower of any place Did Julius Caesar build that place my lord He did my gracious lord begin that place Which since succeeding ages have re edified Is it upon record or else reported Successively from age to age he built it Upon record my gracious lord But say my lord it were not regist'red Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age As ' twere retail'd to all posterity Even to the general all ending day Aside So wise so young they say do never live long What say you uncle I say without characters fame lives long Aside Thus like the formal vice Iniquity I moralize two meanings in one word That Julius Caesar was a famous man With what his valour did enrich his wit His wit set down to make his valour live Death makes no conquest of this conqueror For now he lives in fame though not in life I 'll tell you what my cousin Buckingham- What my gracious lord An if I live until I be a man I 'll win our ancient right in France again Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king Aside Short summers lightly have a forward spring Now in good time here comes the Duke of York Richard of York how fares our loving brother Well my dread lord so must I can you now Ay brother to our grief as it is yours Too late he died that might have kept that title Which by his death hath lost much majesty How fares our cousin noble Lord of York I thank you gentle uncle O my lord You said that idle weeds are fast in growth The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far He hath my lord And therefore is he idle O my fair cousin I must not say so Then he is more beholding to you than I. He may command me as my sovereign But you have power in me as in a kinsman I pray you uncle give me this dagger My dagger little cousin With all my heart A beggar brother Of my kind uncle that I know will give And being but a toy which is no grief to give A greater gift than that I 'll give my cousin A greater gift O that 's the sword to it Ay gentle cousin were it light enough O then I see you will part but with light gifts In weightier things you 'll say a beggar nay It is too heavy for your Grace to wear I weigh it lightly were it heavier What would you have my weapon little Lord I would that I might thank you as you call me How Little My Lord of York will still be cross in talk Uncle your Grace knows how to bear with him You mean to bear me not to bear with me Uncle my brother mocks both you and me Because that I am little like an ape He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders With what a sharp provided wit he reasons To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle He prettily and aptly taunts himself So cunning and so young is wonderful My lord will't please you pass along Myself and my good cousin Buckingham Will to your mother to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower and welcome you What will you go unto the Tower my lord My Lord Protector needs will have it so I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower Why what should you fear Marry my uncle Clarence ' angry ghost My grandam told me he was murder'd there I fear no uncles dead Nor none that live I hope An if they live I hope I need not fear But come my lord and with a heavy heart Thinking on them go I unto the Tower A sennet Think you my lord this little prating York Was not incensed by his subtle mother To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously No doubt no doubt O ' tis a perilous boy Bold quick ingenious forward capable He is all the mother 's from the top to toe Well let them rest Come hither Catesby Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend As closely to conceal what we impart Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way What think'st thou Is it not an easy matter To make William Lord Hastings of our mind For the instalment of this noble Duke In the seat royal of this famous isle He for his father 's sake so loves the Prince That he will not be won to aught against him What think'st thou then of Stanley Will not he He will do all in all as Hastings doth Well then no more but this go gentle Catesby And as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings How he doth stand affected to our purpose And summon him to morrow to the Tower To sit about the coronation If thou dost find him tractable to us Encourage him and tell him all our reasons If he be leaden icy cold unwilling Be thou so too and so break off the talk And give us notice of his inclination For we to morrow hold divided councils Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd Commend me to Lord William Tell him Catesby His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries To morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle And bid my lord for joy of this good news Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more Good Catesby go effect this business soundly My good lords both with all the heed I can Shall we hear from you Catesby ere we sleep You shall my lord At Crosby House there shall you find us both Now my lord what shall we do if we perceive Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots Chop off his head something we will determine And look when I am King claim thou of me The earldom of Hereford and all the movables Whereof the King my brother was possess'd I 'll claim that promise at your Grace 's hand And look to have it yielded with all kindness Come let us sup betimes that afterwards We may digest our complots in some form Exeunt My lord my lord Knocking Within Who knocks One from the Lord Stanley Within What is't o'clock Upon the stroke of four Can not my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious nights So it appears by that I have to say First he commends him to your noble self What then Then certifies your lordship that this night He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm Besides he says there are two councils kept And that may be determin'd at the one Which may make you and him to rue at th ' other Therefore he sends to know your lordship 's pleasure- If you will presently take horse with him And with all speed post with him toward the north To shun the danger that his soul divines Go fellow go return unto thy lord Bid him not fear the separated council His honour and myself are at the one And at the other is my good friend Catesby Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us Whereof I shall not have intelligence Tell him his fears are shallow without instance And for his dreams I wonder he 's so simple To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers To fly the boar before the boar pursues Were to incense the boar to follow us And make pursuit where he did mean no chase Go bid thy master rise and come to me And we will both together to the Tower Where he shall see the boar will use us kindly I 'll go my lord and tell him what you say Many good morrows to my noble lord Good morrow Catesby you are early stirring What news what news in this our tott'ring state It is a reeling world indeed my lord And I believe will never stand upright Till Richard wear the garland of the realm How wear the garland Dost thou mean the crown Ay my good lord I 'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders Before I 'll see the crown so foul misplac'd But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it Ay on my life and hopes to find you forward Upon his party for the gain thereof And thereupon he sends you this good news That this same very day your enemies The kindred of the Queen must die at Pomfret Indeed I am no mourner for that news Because they have been still my adversaries But that I 'll give my voice on Richard 's side To bar my master 's heirs in true descent God knows I will not do it to the death God keep your lordship in that gracious mind But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence That they which brought me in my master 's hate I live to look upon their tragedy Well Catesby ere a fortnight make me older I 'll send some packing that yet think not on't ' Tis a vile thing to die my gracious lord When men are unprepar'd and look not for it O monstrous monstrous And so falls it out With Rivers Vaughan Grey and so ' twill do With some men else that think themselves as safe As thou and I who as thou knowest are dear To princely Richard and to Buckingham The Princes both make high account of you- Aside For they account his head upon the bridge I know they do and I have well deserv'd it My lord good morrow good morrow Catesby You may jest on but by the holy rood I do not like these several councils I. My lord I hold my life as dear as yours And never in my days I do protest Was it so precious to me as ' tis now Think you but that I know our state secure I would be so triumphant as I am The lords at Pomfret when they rode from London Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure And they indeed had no cause to mistrust But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt Pray God I say I prove a needless coward What shall we toward the Tower The day is spent Come come have with you Wot you what my Lord To day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded They for their truth might better wear their heads Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats But come my lord let 's away Go on before I 'll talk with this good fellow The better that your lordship please to ask I tell thee man ' tis better with me now Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet Then was I going prisoner to the Tower By the suggestion of the Queen 's allies But now I tell thee keep it to thyself- This day those enernies are put to death And I in better state than e'er I was God hold it to your honour 's good content Gramercy Hastings there drink that for me I thank your honour Exit Well met my lord I am glad to see your honour I thank thee good Sir John with all my heart I am in your debt for your last exercise Come the next Sabbath and I will content you I 'll wait upon your lordship What talking with a priest Lord Chamberlain Your friends at Pomfret they do need the priest Your honour hath no shriving work in hand Good faith and when I met this holy man The men you talk of came into my mind What go you toward the Tower I do my lord but long I can not stay there I shall return before your lordship thence Nay like enough for I stay dinner there Aside And supper too although thou knowest it not.- Come will you go I 'll wait upon your lordship Exeunt Sir Richard Ratcliff let me tell thee this To day shalt thou behold a subject die For truth for duty and for loyalty God bless the Prince from all the pack of you A knot you are of damned blood suckers You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter Dispatch the limit of your lives is out O Pomfret Pomfret O thou bloody prison Fatal and ominous to noble peers Within the guilty closure of thy walls Now Margaret 's curse is fall'n upon our heads When she exclaim'd on Hastings you and I For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son Then curs'd she Richard then curs'd she Buckingham Then curs'd she Hastings O remember God To hear her prayer for them as now for us And for my sister and her princely sons Be satisfied dear God with our true blood Which as thou know'st unjustly must be spilt Make haste the hour of death is expiate Come Grey come Vaughan let us here embrace Farewell until we meet again in heaven Exeunt Now noble peers the cause why we are met Is to determine of the coronation In God 's name speak when is the royal day Is all things ready for the royal time It is and wants but nomination To morrow then I judge a happy day Who knows the Lord Protector 's mind herein Who is most inward with the noble Duke Your Grace we think should soonest know his mind We know each other 's faces for our hearts He knows no more of mine than I of yours Or I of his my lord than you of mine Lord Hastings you and he are near in love I thank his Grace I know he loves me well But for his purpose in the coronation I have not sounded him nor he deliver'd His gracious pleasure any way therein But you my honourable lords may name the time And in the Duke 's behalf I 'll give my voice Which I presume he 'll take in gentle part In happy time here comes the Duke himself My noble lords and cousins an good morrow I have been long a sleeper but I trust My absence doth neglect no great design Which by my presence might have been concluded Had you not come upon your cue my lord Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder His lordship knows me well and loves me well My lord of Ely when I was last in Holborn I saw good strawberries in your garden there I do beseech you send for some of them Cousin of Buckingham a word with you Withdraw yourself awhile I 'll go with you We have not yet set down this day of triumph To morrow in my judgment is too sudden For I myself am not so well provided As else I would be were the day prolong'd Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester I have sent for these strawberries His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this morning There 's some conceit or other likes him well When that he bids good morrow with such spirit I think there 's never a man in Christendom Can lesser hide his love or hate than he For by his face straight shall you know his heart What of his heart perceive you in his face By any livelihood he show'd to day Marry that with no man here he is offended For were he he had shown it in his looks I pray you all tell me what they deserve That do conspire my death with devilish plots Of damned witchcraft and that have prevail'd Upon my body with their hellish charms The tender love I bear your Grace my lord Makes me most forward in this princely presence To doom th ' offenders whosoe'er they be I say my lord they have deserved death Then be your eyes the witness of their evil Look how I am bewitch'd behold mine arm Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up And this is Edward 's wife that monstrous witch Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore That by their witchcraft thus have marked me If they have done this deed my noble lord- If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet Talk'st thou to me of ifs Thou art a traitor Off with his head Now by Saint Paul I swear I will not dine until I see the same Lovel and Ratcliff look that it be done The rest that love me rise and follow me Woe woe for England not a whit for me For I too fond might have prevented this Come come dispatch the Duke would be at dinner Make a short shrift he longs to see your head O momentary grace of mortal men Which we more hunt for than the grace of God Who builds his hope in air of your good looks Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast Ready with every nod to tumble down Into the fatal bowels of the deep Come come dispatch ' tis bootless to exclaim O bloody Richard Miserable England I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee That ever wretched age hath look'd upon Come lead me to the block bear him my head They smile at me who shortly shall be dead Exeunt Come cousin canst thou quake and change thy colour Murder thy breath in middle of a word And then again begin and stop again As if thou were distraught and mad with terror Tut I can counterfeit the deep tragedian Speak and look back and pry on every side Tremble and start at wagging of a straw Intending deep suspicion Ghastly looks Are at my service like enforced smiles And both are ready in their offices At any time to grace my stratagems But what is Catesby gone He is and see he brings the mayor along Lord Mayor- Look to the drawbridge there Hark a drum Catesby o'erlook the walls Lord Mayor the reason we have sent- Look back defend thee here are enemies God and our innocence defend and guard us Be patient they are friends Ratcliff and Lovel Here is the head of that ignoble traitor The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep I took him for the plainest harmless creature That breath'd upon the earth a Christian Made him my book wherein my soul recorded The history of all her secret thoughts So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue That his apparent open guilt omitted I mean his conversation with Shore 's wife- He liv'd from all attainder of suspects Well well he was the covert'st shelt'red traitor That ever liv'd Would you imagine or almost believe- Were't not that by great preservation We live to tell it that the subtle traitor This day had plotted in the council house To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester Had he done so What think you we are Turks or Infidels Or that we would against the form of law Proceed thus rashly in the villain 's death But that the extreme peril of the case The peace of England and our persons ' safety Enforc'd us to this execution Now fair befall you He deserv'd his death And your good Graces both have well proceeded To warn false traitors from the like attempts I never look'd for better at his hands After he once fell in with Mistress Shore Yet had we not determin'd he should die Until your lordship came to see his end- Which now the loving haste of these our friends Something against our meanings have prevented- Because my lord I would have had you heard The traitor speak and timorously confess The manner and the purpose of his treasons That you might well have signified the same Unto the citizens who haply may Misconster us in him and wail his death But my good lord your Grace 's words shall serve As well as I had seen and heard him speak And do not doubt right noble Princes both But I 'll acquaint our duteous citizens With all your just proceedings in this cause And to that end we wish'd your lordship here T ' avoid the the the censures of the carping world Which since you come too late of our intent Yet witness what you hear we did intend And so my good Lord Mayor we bid farewell Go after after cousin Buckingham The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post There at your meet'st advantage of the time Infer the bastardy of Edward 's children Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen Only for saying he would make his son Heir to the crown meaning indeed his house Which by the sign thereof was termed so Moreover urge his hateful luxury And bestial appetite in change of lust Which stretch'd unto their servants daughters wives Even where his raging eye or savage heart Without control lusted to make a prey Nay for a need thus far come near my person Tell them when that my mother went with child Of that insatiate Edward noble York My princely father then had wars in France And by true computation of the time Found that the issue was not his begot Which well appeared in his lineaments Being nothing like the noble Duke my father Yet touch this sparingly as ' twere far off Because my lord you know my mother lives Doubt not my lord I 'll play the orator As if the golden fee for which I plead Were for myself and so my lord adieu If you thrive well bring them to Baynard 's Castle Where you shall find me well accompanied With reverend fathers and well learned bishops I go and towards three or four o'clock Look for the news that the Guildhall affords Exit Go Lovel with all speed to Doctor Shaw To CATESBY Go thou to Friar Penker Bid them both Meet me within this hour at Baynard 's Castle Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd That it may be to day read o'er in Paul 's And mark how well the sequel hangs together Eleven hours I have spent to write it over For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me The precedent was full as long a doing And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd Untainted unexamin'd free at liberty Here 's a good world the while Who is so gros That can not see this palpable device Yet who 's so bold but says he sees it not Bad is the world and all will come to nought When such ill dealing must be seen in thought Exit How now how now What say the citizens Now by the holy Mother of our Lord The citizens are mum say not a word Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward 's children I did with his contract with Lady Lucy And his contract by deputy in France Th ' insatiate greediness of his desire And his enforcement of the city wives His tyranny for trifles his own bastardy As being got your father then in France And his resemblance being not like the Duke Withal I did infer your lineaments Being the right idea of your father Both in your form and nobleness of mind Laid open all your victories in Scotland Your discipline in war wisdom in peace Your bounty virtue fair humility Indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse And when mine oratory drew toward end I bid them that did love their country 's good Cry ' God save Richard England 's royal King ' And did they so No so God help me they spake not a word But like dumb statues or breathing stones Star'd each on other and look'd deadly pale Which when I saw I reprehended them And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence His answer was the people were not used To be spoke to but by the Recorder Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again ' Thus saith the Duke thus hath the Duke inferr'd'- But nothing spoke in warrant from himself When he had done some followers of mine own At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps And some ten voices cried ' God save King Richard ' And thus I took the vantage of those few- ' Thanks gentle citizens and friends ' quoth I ' This general applause and cheerful shout Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard ' And even here brake off and came away What tongueless blocks were they Would they not speak Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come The Mayor is here at hand Intend some fear Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit And look you get a prayer book in your hand And stand between two churchmen good my lord For on that ground I 'll make a holy descant And be not easily won to our requests Play the maid 's part still answer nay and take it I go and if you plead as well for them As I can say nay to thee for myself No doubt we bring it to a happy issue Go go up to the leads the Lord Mayor knocks Exit GLOUCESTER He doth entreat your Grace my noble lord To visit him to morrow or next day He is within with two right reverend fathers Divinely bent to meditation And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd To draw him from his holy exercise Return good Catesby to the gracious Duke Tell him myself the Mayor and Aldermen In deep designs in matter of great moment No less importing than our general good Are come to have some conference with his Grace I 'll signify so much unto him straight Exit Ah ha my lord this prince is not an Edward He is not lolling on a lewd love bed But on his knees at meditation Not dallying with a brace of courtezans But meditating with two deep divines Not sleeping to engross his idle body But praying to enrich his watchful soul Happy were England would this virtuous prince Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof But sure I fear we shall not win him to it Marry God defend his Grace should say us nay I fear he will Here Catesby comes again My lord He wonders to what end you have assembled Such troops of citizens to come to him His Grace not being warn'd thereof before He fears my lord you mean no good to him Sorry I am my noble cousin should Suspect me that I mean no good to him By heaven we come to him in perfect love And so once more return and tell his Grace See where his Grace stands ' tween two clergymen Two props of virtue for a Christian prince To stay him from the fall of vanity And see a book of prayer in his hand True ornaments to know a holy man Famous Plantagenet most gracious Prince Lend favourable ear to our requests And pardon us the interruption Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal My lord there needs no such apology I do beseech your Grace to pardon me Who earnest in the service of my God Deferr'd the visitation of my friends But leaving this what is your Grace 's pleasure Even that I hope which pleaseth God above And all good men of this ungovern'd isle I do suspect I have done some offence That seems disgracious in the city 's eye And that you come to reprehend my ignorance You have my lord Would it might please your Grace On our entreaties to amend your fault Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land Know then it is your fault that you resign The supreme seat the throne majestical The scept'red office of your ancestors Your state of fortune and your due of birth The lineal glory of your royal house To the corruption of a blemish'd stock Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts Which here we waken to our country 's good The noble isle doth want her proper limbs Her face defac'd with scars of infamy Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion Which to recure we heartily solicit Your gracious self to take on you the charge And kingly government of this your land- Not as protector steward substitute Or lowly factor for another 's gain But as successively from blood to blood Your right of birth your empery your own For this consorted with the citizens Your very worshipful and loving friends And by their vehement instigation In this just cause come I to move your Grace I can not tell if to depart in silence Or bitterly to speak in your reproof Best fitteth my degree or your condition If not to answer you might haply think Tongue tied ambition not replying yielded To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty Which fondly you would here impose on me If to reprove you for this suit of yours So season'd with your faithful love to me Then on the other side I check'd my friends Therefore to speak and to avoid the first And then in speaking not to incur the last- Definitively thus I answer you Your love deserves my thanks but my desert Unmeritable shuns your high request First if all obstacles were cut away And that my path were even to the crown As the ripe revenue and due of birth Yet so much is my poverty of spirit So mighty and so many my defects That I would rather hide me from my greatness- Being a bark to brook no mighty sea- Than in my greatness covet to be hid And in the vapour of my glory smother'd But God be thank'd there is no need of me- And much I need to help you were there need The royal tree hath left us royal fruit Which mellow'd by the stealing hours of time Will well become the seat of majesty And make no doubt us happy by his reign On him I lay that you would lay on me- The right and fortune of his happy stars Which God defend that I should wring from him My lord this argues conscience in your Grace But the respects thereof are nice and trivial All circumstances well considered You say that Edward is your brother 's son So say we too but not by Edward 's wife For first was he contract to Lady Lucy- Your mother lives a witness to his vow- And afterward by substitute betroth'd To Bona sister to the King of France These both put off a poor petitioner A care craz'd mother to a many sons A beauty waning and distressed widow Even in the afternoon of her best days Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loath'd bigamy By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward whom our manners call the Prince More bitterly could I expostulate Save that for reverence to some alive I give a sparing limit to my tongue Then good my lord take to your royal self This proffer'd benefit of dignity If not to bless us and the land withal Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal true derived course Do good my lord your citizens entreat you Refuse not mighty lord this proffer'd love O make them joyful grant their lawful suit Alas why would you heap this care on me I am unfit for state and majesty I do beseech you take it not amiss I can not nor I will not yield to you If you refuse it as in love and zeal Loath to depose the child your brother 's son As well we know your tenderness of heart And gentle kind effeminate remorse Which we have noted in you to your kindred And egally indeed to all estates- Yet know whe'er you accept our suit or no Your brother 's son shall never reign our king But we will plant some other in the throne To the disgrace and downfall of your house And in this resolution here we leave you Come citizens Zounds I 'll entreat no more O do not swear my lord of Buckingham Call him again sweet Prince accept their suit If you deny them all the land will rue it Will you enforce me to a world of cares Call them again I am not made of stones But penetrable to your kind entreaties Albeit against my conscience and my soul God bless your Grace We see it and will say it In saying so you shall but say the truth Then I salute you with this royal title- Long live King Richard England 's worthy King Amen To morrow may it please you to be crown'd Even when you please for you will have it so To morrow then we will attend your Grace And so most joyfully we take our leave To the BISHOPS Come let us to our holy work again Farewell my cousin farewell gentle friends Exeunt Who meets us here My niece Plantagenet Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester Now for my life she 's wand'ring to the Tower On pure heart 's love to greet the tender Princes Daughter well met God give your Graces both A happy and a joyful time of day As much to you good sister Whither away No farther than the Tower and as I guess Upon the like devotion as yourselves To gratulate the gentle Princes there Kind sister thanks we 'll enter all together Right well dear madam By your patience I may not suffer you to visit them The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary The King Who 's that I mean the Lord Protector The Lord protect him from that kingly title Hath he set bounds between their love and me I am their mother who shall bar me from them I am their father 's mother I will see them Their aunt I am in law in love their mother Then bring me to their sights I 'll bear thy blame And take thy office from thee on my peril No madam no I may not leave it so I am bound by oath and therefore pardon me Exit Let me but meet you ladies one hour hence And I 'll salute your Grace of York as mother And reverend looker on of two fair queens To ANNE Come madam you must straight to Westminster There to be crowned Richard 's royal queen Ah cut my lace asunder That my pent heart may have some scope to beat Or else I swoon with this dead killing news Despiteful tidings O unpleasing news Be of good cheer mother how fares your Grace O Dorset speak not to me get thee gone Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels Thy mother 's name is ominous to children If thou wilt outstrip death go cross the seas And live with Richmond from the reach of hell Go hie thee hie thee from this slaughter house Lest thou increase the number of the dead And make me die the thrall of Margaret 's curse Nor mother wife nor England 's counted queen Full of wise care is this your counsel madam Take all the swift advantage of the hours You shall have letters from me to my son In your behalf to meet you on the way Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay O ill dispersing wind of misery O my accursed womb the bed of death A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world Whose unavoided eye is murderous Come madam come I in all haste was sent And I with all unwillingness will go O would to God that the inclusive verge Of golden metal that must round my brow Were red hot steel to sear me to the brains Anointed let me be with deadly venom And die ere men can say ' God save the Queen ' Go go poor soul I envy not thy glory To feed my humour wish thyself no harm No why When he that is my husband now Came to me as I follow'd Henry 's corse When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands Which issued from my other angel husband And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd- O when I say I look'd on Richard 's face This was my wish ' Be thou ' quoth I ' accurs'd For making me so young so old a widow And when thou wed'st let sorrow haunt thy bed And be thy wife if any be so mad More miserable by the life of thee Than thou hast made me by my dear lord 's death ' Lo ere I can repeat this curse again Within so small a time my woman 's heart Grossly grew captive to his honey words And prov'd the subject of mine own soul 's curse Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest For never yet one hour in his bed Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd Besides he hates me for my father Warwick And will no doubt shortly be rid of me Poor heart adieu I pity thy complaining No more than with my soul I mourn for yours Farewell thou woeful welcomer of glory Adieu poor soul that tak'st thy leave of it To DORSET Go thou to Richmond and good fortune guide thee To ANNE Go thou to Richard and good angels tend thee To QUEEN ELIZABETH Go thou to sanctuary and good thoughts possess thee I to my grave where peace and rest lie with me Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen And each hour 's joy wreck'd with a week of teen Stay yet look back with me unto the Tower Pity you ancient stones those tender babes Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls Rough cradle for such little pretty ones Rude ragged nurse old sullen playfellow For tender princes use my babies well So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell Exeunt Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham My gracious sovereign Give me thy hand Still live they and for ever let them last Ah Buckingham now do I play the touch To try if thou be current gold indeed Young Edward lives think now what I would speak Say on my loving lord Why Buckingham I say I would be King Why so you are my thrice renowned lord Ha am I King ' Tis so but Edward lives True noble Prince O bitter consequence That Edward still should live true noble Prince Cousin thou wast not wo nt to be so dull Shall I be plain I wish the bastards dead And I would have it suddenly perform'd What say'st thou now Speak suddenly be brief Your Grace may do your pleasure Tut tut thou art all ice thy kindness freezes Say have I thy consent that they shall die Give me some little breath some pause dear Lord Before I positively speak in this I will resolve you herein presently Exit Aside to another The King is angry see he gnaws his lip I will converse with iron witted fools My lord Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold Will tempt unto a close exploit of death I know a discontented gentleman Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit Gold were as good as twenty orators And will no doubt tempt him to anything What is his name His name my lord is Tyrrel I partly know the man Go call him hither boy Exit PAGE The deep revolving witty Buckingham No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels Hath he so long held out with me untir'd And stops he now for breath Well be it so Know my loving lord The Marquis Dorset as I hear is fled To Richmond in the parts where he abides Stands apart Come hither Catesby Rumour it abroad That Anne my wife is very grievous sick I will take order for her keeping close Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman Whom I will marry straight to Clarence ' daughter- The boy is foolish and I fear not him Look how thou dream'st I say again give out That Anne my queen is sick and like to die About it for it stands me much upon To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me James Tyrrel and your most obedient subject Art thou indeed Prove me my gracious lord Dar'st'thou resolve to kill a friend of mine Please you But I had rather kill two enemies Why then thou hast it Two deep enemies Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep 's disturbers Are they that I would have thee deal upon Let me have open means to come to them And soon I 'll rid you from the fear of them Thou sing'st sweet music Hark come hither Tyrrel Go by this token Rise and lend thine ear Whispers There is no more but so say it is done And I will love thee and prefer thee for it I will dispatch it straight Exit Well let that rest Dorset is fled to Richmond I hear the news my lord Stanley he is your wife 's son well look unto it My lord I claim the gift my due by promise For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd Th ' earldom of Hereford and the movables Which you have promised I shall possess Stanley look to your wife if she convey Letters to Richmond you shall answer it What says your Highness to my just request I do remember me Henry the Sixth Did prophesy that Richmond should be King When Richmond was a little peevish boy A king!-perhaps- My lord- How chance the prophet could not at that time Have told me I being by that I should kill him My lord your promise for the earldom- Richmond When last I was at Exeter The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle And call'd it Rugemount at which name I started Because a bard of Ireland told me once I should not live long after I saw Richmond My lord- Ay what 's o'clock I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind Of what you promis'd me Well but o'clock Upon the stroke of ten Well let it strike Why let it strike Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the stroke Betwixt thy begging and my meditation I am not in the giving vein to day May it please you to resolve me in my suit Thou troublest me I am not in the vein And is it thus Repays he my deep service With such contempt Made I him King for this O let me think on Hastings and be gone To Brecknock while my fearful head is on Exit The tyrannous and bloody act is done The most arch deed of piteous massacre That ever yet this land was guilty of Dighton and Forrest who I did suborn To do this piece of ruthless butchery Albeit they were flesh'd villains bloody dogs Melted with tenderness and mild compassion Wept like two children in their deaths ' sad story ' O thus ' quoth Dighton ' lay the gentle babes'- ' Thus thus ' quoth Forrest ' girdling one another Within their alabaster innocent arms Their lips were four red roses on a stalk And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other A book of prayers on their pillow lay Which once ' quoth Forrest ' almost chang'd my mind But O the devil'-there the villain stopp'd When Dighton thus told on ' We smothered The most replenished sweet work of nature That from the prime creation e'er she framed ' Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse They could not speak and so I left them both To bear this tidings to the bloody King Kind Tyrrel am I happy in thy news If to have done the thing you gave in charge Beget your happiness be happy then For it is done But didst thou see them dead I did my lord And buried gentle Tyrrel The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them But where to say the truth I do not know Come to me Tyrrel soon at after supper When thou shalt tell the process of their death Meantime but think how I may do thee good And be inheritor of thy desire Farewell till then I humbly take my leave Exit The son of Clarence have I pent up close His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham 's bosom And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night Now for I know the Britaine Richmond aims At young Elizabeth my brother 's daughter And by that knot looks proudly on the crown To her go I a jolly thriving wooer My lord Good or bad news that thou com'st in so bluntly Bad news my lord Morton is fled to Richmond And Buckingham back'd with the hardy Welshmen Is in the field and still his power increaseth Ely with Richmond troubles me more near Than Buckingham and his rash levied strength Come I have learn'd that fearful commenting Is leaden servitor to dull delay Delay leads impotent and snail pac'd beggary Then fiery expedition be my wing Jove 's Mercury and herald for a king Go muster men My counsel is my shield We must be brief when traitors brave the field Exeunt So now prosperity begins to mellow And drop into the rotten mouth of death Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd To watch the waning of mine enemies A dire induction am I witness to And will to France hoping the consequence Will prove as bitter black and tragical Withdraw thee wretched Margaret Who comes here Ah my poor princes ah my tender babes My unblown flowers new appearing sweets If

you slept my lord The sweetest sleep and fairest boding dreams That ever ent'red in a drowsy head Have I since your departure had my lords Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd Came to my tent and cried on victory I promise you my soul is very jocund In the remembrance of so fair a dream How far into the morning is it lords Upon the stroke of four Why then ' tis time to arm and give direction What said Northumberland as touching Richmond That he was never trained up in arms He said the truth and what said Surrey then He smil'd and said ' The better for our purpose ' Not I my lord Then he disdains to shine for by the book He should have brav'd the east an hour ago A black day will it be to somebody Ratcliff My lord The sun will not be seen to day The sky doth frown and lour

dragons Upon them Victory sits on our helms Exeunt Rescue my Lord of Norfolk rescue rescue The King enacts more wonders than a man Daring an opposite to every danger His horse is slain and all on foot he fights Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death Rescue fair lord or else the day is lost A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse Withdraw my lord I 'll help you to a horse Slave I have set my life upon a cast And I Will stand the hazard of the die I think there be six Richmonds in the field Five have I slain to day instead of him A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse Exeunt God and your arms be prais'd victorious friends The day is ours the bloody dog is dead Courageous Richmond well hast thou acquit thee Lo here this long usurped royalty From the dead temples of this bloody wretch Have I pluck'd off to grace thy brows withal Wear it enjoy it and make much of it Great God of heaven say Amen to all But teLL me is young George Stanley living He is my lord and safe in Leicester town Whither if it please you we may now withdraw us What men of name are slain on either side John Duke of Norfolk Walter Lord Ferrers Sir Robert Brakenbury and Sir William Brandon Inter their bodies as becomes their births Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled That in submission will return to us And then as we have ta'en the sacrament We will unite the white rose and the red Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction That long have frown'd upon their emnity What traitor hears me and says not Amen England hath long been mad and scarr'd herself The brother blindly shed the brother 's blood The father rashly slaughter'd his own son The son compell'd been butcher to the sire All this divided York and Lancaster Divided in their dire division O now let Richmond and Elizabeth The true succeeders of each royal house By God 's fair ordinance conjoin together And let their heirs God if thy will be so Enrich the time to come with smooth fac'd peace With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days Abate the edge of traitors gracious Lord That would reduce these bloody days again And make poor England weep in streams of blood Let them not live to taste this land 's increase That would with treason wound this fair land 's peace Now civil wounds are stopp'd peace lives again- That she may long live here God say Amen Exeunt I 'll pheeze you in faith A pair of stocks you rogue Y'are a baggage the Slys are no rogues Look in the chronicles we came in with Richard Conqueror Therefore paucas pallabris let the world slide Sessa You will not pay for the glasses you have burst No not a denier Go by Saint Jeronimy go to thy cold bed and warm thee I know my remedy I must go fetch the third borough Third or fourth or fifth borough I 'll answer him by law I 'll not budge an inch boy let

the hedge corner in the coldest fault I would not lose the dog for twenty pound Why Belman is as good as he my lord He cried upon it at the merest loss And twice to day pick'd out the dullest scent Trust me I take him for the better dog Thou art a fool if Echo were as fleet I would esteem him worth a dozen such But sup them well and look unto them all To morrow I intend to hunt again I will my lord What 's here One dead or drunk See doth he breathe He breathes my lord Were he not warm'd with ale This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly O monstrous beast how like a swine he lies Grim death how foul and loathsome is thine image Sirs I will practise on this drunken man What think you if he were convey'd to bed Wrapp'd in sweet clothes rings put upon his fingers A most delicious banquet by his bed And brave attendants near him when he wakes Would not the beggar then forget himself Believe me lord I think he can not choose It would seem strange unto him when he wak'd Even as a flatt'ring dream or worthless fancy Then take him up and manage well the jest Carry him gently to my fairest chamber And hang it round with all my wanton pictures Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet Procure me music ready when he wakes To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound And if he chance to speak be ready straight And with a low submissive reverence Say ' What is it your honour will command ' Let one attend him with a silver basin Full of rose water and bestrew'd with flowers Another bear the ewer the third a diaper And say ' Will't please your lordship cool your hands ' Some one be ready with a costly suit And ask him what apparel he will wear Another tell him of his hounds and horse And that his lady mourns at his disease Persuade him that he hath been lunatic And when he says he is say that he dreams For he is nothing but a mighty lord This do and do it kindly gentle sirs It will be pastime passing excellent If it be husbanded with modesty My lord I warrant you we will play our part As he shall think by our true diligence He is no less than what we say he is Take him up gently and to bed with him And each one to his office when he wakes An't please your honour players That offer service to your lordship Bid them come near We thank your honour Do you intend to stay with me to night So please your lordship to accept our duty With all my heart This fellow I remember Since once he play'd a farmer 's eldest son ' Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well I have forgot your name but sure that part Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd I think ' twas Soto that your honour means ' Tis very true thou didst it excellent Well you are come to me in happy time The rather for I have some sport in hand Wherein your cunning can assist me much There is a lord will hear you play to night But I am doubtful of your modesties Lest over eying of his odd behaviour For yet his honour never heard a play You break into some merry passion And so offend him for I tell you sirs If you should smile he grows impatient Fear not my lord we can contain ourselves Were he the veriest antic in the world Go sirrah take them to the buttery And give them friendly welcome every one Let them want nothing that my house affords For God 's sake a pot of small ale Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack Will't please your honour taste of these conserves What raiment will your honour wear to day I am Christophero Sly call not me ' honour ' nor ' lordship ' I ne'er drank sack in my life and if you give me any conserves give me conserves of beef Ne'er ask me what raiment I 'll wear for I have no more doublets than backs no more stockings than legs nor no more shoes than feet- nay sometime more feet than shoes or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour O that a mighty man of such descent Of such possessions and so high esteem Should be infused with so foul a spirit What would you make me mad Am not I Christopher Sly old Sly 's son of Burton Heath by birth a pedlar by education a cardmaker by transmutation a bear herd and now by present profession a tinker Ask Marian Hacket the fat ale wife of Wincot if she know me not if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale score me up for the lying'st knave in Christendom What I am not bestraught Taking a pot of ale Here's- O this it is that makes your lady mourn O this is it that makes your servants droop Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house As beaten hence by your strange lunacy O noble lord bethink thee of thy birth Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment And banish hence these abject lowly dreams Look how thy servants do attend on thee Each in his office ready at thy beck Wilt thou have music Hark Apollo plays Music And twenty caged nightingales do sing Or wilt thou sleep We 'll have thee to a couch Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis Say thou wilt walk we will bestrew the ground Or wilt thou ride Thy horses shall be trapp'd Their harness studded all with gold and pearl Dost thou love hawking Thou hast hawks will soar Above the morning lark Or wilt thou hunt Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them And fetch shall echoes from the hollow earth Say thou wilt course thy greyhounds are as swift As breathed stags ay fleeter than the roe Dost thou love pictures We will fetch thee We 'll show thee lo as she was a maid And how she was beguiled and surpris'd As lively painted as the deed was done Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn Thou art a lord and nothing but a lord Thou hast a lady far more beautiful Than any woman in this waning age And till the tears that she hath shed for thee Like envious floods o'er run her lovely face She was the fairest creature in the world And yet she is inferior to none Am I a lord and have I such a lady Or do I dream Or have I dream'd till now I do not sleep I see I hear I speak I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things Upon my life I am a lord indeed And not a tinker nor Christopher Sly Well bring our lady hither to our sight And once again a pot o ' th ' smallest ale Will't please your Mightiness to wash your hands O how we joy to see your wit restor'd O that once more you knew but what you are These fifteen years you have been in a dream Or when you wak'd so wak'd as if you slept These fifteen years by my fay a goodly nap But did I never speak of all that time O yes my lord but very idle words For though you lay here in this goodly chamber Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door And rail upon the hostess of the house And say you would present her at the leet Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket Ay the woman 's maid of the house Why sir you know no house nor no such maid Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up As Stephen Sly and old John Naps of Greece And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell And twenty more such names and men as these Which never were nor no man ever saw Now Lord be thanked for my good amends Amen I thank thee thou shalt not lose by it How fares my noble lord Marry I fare well for here is cheer enough Where is my wife Here noble lord what is thy will with her Are you my wife and will not call me husband My men should call me ' lord ' I am your goodman My husband and my lord my lord and husband I am your wife in all obedience I know it well What must I call her Madam Al'ce madam or Joan madam Madam and nothing else so lords call ladies Madam wife they say that I have dream'd And slept above some fifteen year or more Ay and the time seems thirty unto me Being all this time abandon'd from your bed ' Tis much Servants leave me and her alone Thrice noble lord let me entreat of you To pardon me yet for a night or two Or if not so until the sun be set For your physicians have expressly charg'd In peril to incur your former malady That I should yet absent me from your bed I hope this reason stands for my excuse Ay it stands so that I may hardly tarry so long But I would be loath to fall into my dreams again I will therefore tarry in despite of the flesh and the blood Your honour 's players hearing your amendment Are come to play a pleasant comedy For so your doctors hold it very meet Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy Therefore they thought it good you hear a play And frame your mind to mirth and merriment Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life Marry I will let them play it Is not a comonty a Christmas gambold or a tumbling trick No my good lord it is more pleasing stuff What household stuff It is a kind of history Well we 'll see't Come madam wife sit by my side and let the world slip;-we shall ne'er be younger Tranio since for the great desire I had To see fair Padua nursery of arts I am arriv'd for fruitful Lombardy The pleasant garden of great Italy And by my father 's love and

achiev'd Tell me thy mind for I have Pisa left And am to Padua come as he that leaves A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst Mi perdonato gentle master mine I am in all affected as yourself Glad that you thus continue your resolve To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy Only good master while we do admire This virtue and this moral discipline Let 's be no Stoics nor no stocks I pray Or so devote to Aristotle 's checks As Ovid be an outcast quite abjur'd Balk logic with acquaintance that you have And practise rhetoric in your common talk Music and poesy use to quicken you The mathematics and the metaphysics Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en In brief sir study what you most affect Gramercies Tranio well dost thou advise If Biondello thou wert come ashore We could at once put us in readiness And take a lodging fit to entertain Such friends as time in Padua shall beget Master some show to welcome us to town Gentlemen importune me no farther For how I firmly am resolv'd you know That is not to bestow my youngest daughter Before I have a husband for the elder If either of you both love Katherina Because I know you well and love you well Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure To cart her rather She 's too rough for me There there Hortensio will you any wife To BAPTISTA I pray you sir is it your will To make a stale of me amongst these mates Mates maid How mean you that No mates for you Unless you were of gentler milder mould I ' faith sir you shall never need to fear Iwis it is not halfway to her heart But if it were doubt not her care should be To comb your noddle with a three legg'd stool And paint your face and use you like a fool From all such devils good Lord deliver us And me too good Lord Husht master Here 's some good pastime toward That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward But in the other 's silence do I see Maid 's mild behaviour and sobriety Peace Tranio Well said master mum and gaze your fill Gentlemen that I may soon make good What I have said- Bianca get you in And let it not displease thee good Bianca For I will love thee ne'er the less my girl A pretty peat it is best Put finger in the eye an she knew why Sister content you in my discontent Sir to your pleasure humbly I subscribe My books and instruments shall be my company On them to look and practise by myself Hark Tranio thou mayst hear Minerva speak Signior Baptista will you be so strange Sorry am I that our good will effects Bianca 's grief Why will you mew her up Signior Baptista for this fiend of hell And make her bear the penance of her tongue Gentlemen content ye I am resolv'd Go in Bianca Exit BIANCA And for I know she taketh most delight In music instruments and poetry Schoolmasters will I keep within my house Fit to instruct her youth If you Hortensio Or Signior Gremio you know any such Prefer them hither for to cunning men I will be very kind and liberal To mine own children in good bringing up And so farewell Katherina you may stay For I have more to commune with Bianca Exit Why and I trust I may go too may I not What shall I be appointed hours as though belike I knew not what to take and what to leave Ha Exit You may go to the devil 's dam your gifts are so good here 's none will hold you There Love is not so great Hortensio but we may blow our nails together and fast it fairly out our cake 's dough on both sides Farewell yet for the love I bear my sweet Bianca if I can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights I will wish him to her father SO Will I Signior Gremio but a word I pray Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brook'd parle know now upon advice it toucheth us both- that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in Bianca 's love- to labour and effect one thing specially What 's that I pray Marry sir to get a husband for her sister A husband a devil I say a husband I say a devil Think'st thou Hortensio though her father be very rich any man is so very a fool to be married to hell Tush Gremio Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums why man there be good fellows in the world an a man could light on them would take her with all faults and money enough I can not tell but I had as lief take her dowry with this condition to be whipp'd at the high cross every morning Faith as you say there 's small choice in rotten apples But come since this bar in law makes us friends it shall be so far forth friendly maintain'd till by helping Baptista 's eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband and then have to't afresh Sweet Bianca Happy man be his dole He that runs fastest gets the ring How say you Signior Gremio I am agreed and would I had given him the best horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her we d her and bed her and rid the house of her Come on I pray sir tell me is it possible That love should of a sudden take such hold O Tranio till I found it to be true I never thought it possible or likely But see while idly I stood looking on I found the effect of love in idleness And now in plainness do confess to thee That art to me as secret and as dear As Anna to the Queen of Carthage was- Tranio I burn I pine I perish Tranio If I achieve not this young modest girl Counsel me Tranio for I know thou canst Assist me Tranio for I know thou wilt Master it is no time to chide you now Affection is not rated from the heart If love have touch'd you nought remains but so ' Redime te captum quam queas minimo ' Gramercies lad Go forward this contents The rest will comfort for thy counsel 's sound Master you look'd so longly on the maid Perhaps you mark'd not what 's the pith of all O yes I saw sweet beauty in her face Such as the daughter of Agenor had That made great Jove to humble him to her hand When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand Saw you no more Mark'd you not how her sister Began to scold and raise up such a storm That mortal ears might hardly endure the din Tranio I saw her coral lips to move And with her breath she did perfume the air Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her Nay then ' tis time to stir him from his trance I pray awake sir If you love the maid Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her Thus it stands Her elder sister is so curst and shrewd That till the father rid his hands of her Master your love must live a maid at home And therefore has he closely mew'd her up Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors Ah Tranio what a cruel father 's he But art thou not advis'd he took some care To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her Ay marry am I sir and now ' tis plotted I have it Tranio Master for my hand Both our inventions meet and jump in one Tell me thine first You will be schoolmaster And undertake the teaching of the maid- That 's your device It is May it be done Not possible for who shall bear your part And be in Padua here Vincentio 's son Keep house and ply his book welcome his friends Visit his countrymen and banquet them Basta content thee for I have it full We have not yet been seen in any house Nor can we be distinguish'd by our faces For man or master Then it follows thus Thou shalt be master Tranio in my stead Keep house and port and servants as I should I will some other be- some Florentine Some Neapolitan or meaner man of Pisa ' Tis hatch'd and shall be so Tranio at once Uncase thee take my colour'd hat and cloak When Biondello comes he waits on thee But I will charm him first to keep his tongue So had you need They exchange habits In brief sir sith it your pleasure is And I am tied to be obedient- For so your father charg'd me at our parting ' Be serviceable to my son ' quoth he Although I think ' twas in another sense- I am content to be Lucentio Because so well I love Lucentio Tranio be so because Lucentio loves And let me be a slave t ' achieve that maid Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye Where have I been Nay how now where are you Master has my fellow Tranio stol'n your clothes Or you stol'n his or both Pray what 's the news Sirrah come hither ' tis no time to jest And therefore frame your manners to the time Your fellow Tranio here to save my life Puts my apparel and my count'nance on And I for my escape have put on his For in a quarrel since I came ashore I kill'd a man and fear I was descried Wait you on him I charge you as becomes While I make way from hence to save my life You understand me I sir Ne'er a whit And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth Tranio is chang'd into Lucentio The better for him would I were so too So could I faith boy to have the next wish after That Lucentio indeed had Baptista 's youngest daughter But sirrah not for my sake but your master 's I advise You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies When I am alone why then I am Tranio But in all places else your master Lucentio Tranio let 's go One thing more rests that thyself execute- To make one among these wooers If thou ask me why- Sufficeth my reasons are both good and weighty Exeunt My lord you nod you do not mind the play Yes by Saint Anne do I. A good matter surely comes there any more of it My lord ' tis but begun ' Tis a very excellent piece of work madam lady Would ' twere done They sit and mark Verona for a while I take my leave To see my friends in Padua but of all My best beloved and approved friend Hortensio and I trow this is his house Here sirrah Grumio knock I say Villain I say knock me here soundly Knock you here sir Why sir what am I sir that I should knock you here sir Villain I say knock me at this gate And rap me well or I 'll knock your knave 's pate My master is grown quarrelsome I should knock you first And then I know after who comes by the worst Will it not be Faith sirrah an you 'll not knock I 'll ring it I 'll try how you can sol fa and sing it Help masters help My master is mad Now knock when I bid you sirrah villain How now what 's the matter My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio How do you all at Verona Signior Hortensio come you to part the fray ' Con tutto il cuore ben trovato ' may I say Alla nostra casa ben venuto Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio Rise Grumio rise we will compound this quarrel Nay ' tis no matter sir what he ' leges in Latin If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you sir he bid me knock him and rap him soundly sir Well was it fit for a servant to use his master so being perhaps for aught I see two and thirty a pip out Whom would to God I had well knock'd at first Then had not Grumio come by the worst A senseless villain Good Hortensio I bade the rascal knock upon your gate And could not get him for my heart to do it Knock at the gate O heavens Spake you not these words plain ' Sirrah knock me here rap me here knock me well and knock me soundly ' And come you now with ' knocking at the gate ' Sirrah be gone or talk not I advise you Petruchio patience I am Grumio 's pledge Why this 's a heavy chance ' twixt him and you Your ancient trusty pleasant servant Grumio And tell me now sweet friend what happy gale Blows you to Padua here from old Verona Such wind as scatters young men through the world To seek their fortunes farther than at home Where small experience grows But in a few Signior Hortensio thus it stands with me Antonio my father is deceas'd And I have thrust myself into this maze Haply to wive and thrive as best I may Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home And so am come abroad to see the world Petruchio shall I then come roundly to thee And wish thee to a shrewd ill favour'd wife Thou'dst thank me but a little for my counsel And yet I 'll promise thee she shall be rich And very rich but th'art too much my friend And I 'll not wish thee to her Signior Hortensio ' twixt such friends as we Few words suffice and therefore if thou know One rich enough to be Petruchio 's wife As wealth is burden of my wooing dance Be she as foul as was Florentius ' love As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd As Socrates ' Xanthippe or a worse- She moves me not or not removes at least Affection 's edge in me were she as rough As are the swelling Adriatic seas I come to wive it wealthily in Padua If wealthily then happily in Padua Nay look you sir he tells you flatly what his mind is Why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet baby or an old trot with ne'er a tooth in her head though she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses Why nothing comes amiss so money comes withal Petruchio since we are stepp'd thus far in I will continue that I broach'd in jest I can Petruchio help thee to a wife With wealth enough and young and beauteous Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman Her only fault and that is faults enough Is- that she is intolerable curst And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure That were my state far worser than it is I would not we d her for a mine of gold Hortensio peace thou know'st not gold 's effect Tell me her father 's name and ' tis enough For I will board her though she chide as loud As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack Her father is Baptista Minola An affable and courteous gentleman Her name is Katherina Minola Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue I know her father though I know not her And he knew my deceased father well I will not sleep Hortensio till I see her And therefore let me be thus bold with you To give you over at this first encounter Unless you will accompany me thither I pray you sir let him go while the humour lasts O ' my word and she knew him as well as I do she would think scolding would do little good upon him She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so Why that 's nothing and he begin once he 'll rail in his rope tricks I 'll tell you what sir an she stand him but a little he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat You know him not sir Tarry Petruchio I must go with thee For in Baptista 's keep my treasure is He hath the jewel of my life in hold His youngest daughter beautiful Bianca And her withholds from me and other more Suitors to her and rivals in my love Supposing it a thing impossible- For those defects I have before rehears'd- That ever Katherina will be woo'd Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katherine the curst have got a husband Katherine the curst A title for a maid of all titles the worst Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace And offer me disguis'd in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music to instruct Bianca That so I may by this device at least Have leave and leisure to make love to her And unsuspected court her by herself Here 's no knavery See to beguile the old folks how the young folks lay their heads together Master master look about you Who goes there ha Peace Grumio It is the rival of my love Petruchio stand by awhile A proper stripling and an amorous O very well I have perus'd the note Hark you sir I 'll have them very fairly bound- All books of love see that at any hand And see you read no other lectures to her You understand me- over and beside Signior Baptista 's liberality I 'll mend it with a largess Take your paper too And let me have them very well perfum'd For she is sweeter than perfume itself To whom they go to What will you read to her Whate'er I read to her I 'll plead for you As for my patron stand you so assur'd As firmly as yourself were still in place Yea and perhaps with more successful words Than you unless you were a scholar sir O this learning what a thing it is O this woodcock what an ass it is Peace sirrah Grumio mum Coming forward God save you Signior Gremio And you are well met Signior Hortensio Trow you whither I am going To Baptista Minola I promis'd to enquire carefully About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca And by good fortune I have lighted well On this young man for learning and behaviour Fit for her turn well read in poetry And other books- good ones I warrant ye ' Tis well and I have met a gentleman Hath promis'd me to help me to another A fine musician to instruct our mistress So shall I no whit be behind in duty To fair Bianca so beloved of me Beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove And that his bags shall prove Gremio ' tis now no time to vent our love Listen to me and if you speak me fair I 'll tell you news indifferent good for either Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met Upon agreement from us to his liking Will undertake to woo curst Katherine Yea and to marry her if her dowry please So said so done is well Hortensio have you told him all her faults I know she is an irksome brawling scold If that be all masters I hear no harm No say'st me so friend What countryman Born in Verona old Antonio 's son My father dead my fortune lives for me And I do hope good days and long to see O Sir such a life with such a wife were strange But if you have a stomach to't a God 's name You shall have me assisting you in all But will you woo this wild cat Will I live Will he woo her Ay or I 'll hang her Why came I hither but to that intent Think you a little din can daunt mine ears Have I not in my time heard lions roar Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat Have I not heard great ordnance in the field And heaven 's artillery thunder in the skies Have I not in a pitched battle heard Loud ' larums neighing steeds and trumpets ' clang And do you tell me of a woman 's tongue That gives not half so great a blow to hear As will a chestnut in a fariner 's fire Tush tush fear boys with bugs For he fears none Hortensio hark This gentleman is happily arriv'd My mind presumes for his own good and ours I promis'd we would be contributors And bear his charge of wooing whatsoe'er And so we will- provided that he win her I would I were as sure of a good dinner Gentlemen God save you If I may be bold Tell me I beseech you which is the readiest way To the house of Signior Baptista Minola He that has the two fair daughters is't he you mean Even he Biondello Hark you sir you mean not her to- Perhaps him and her sir what have you to do Not her that chides sir at any hand I pray I love no chiders sir Biondello let 's away Aside Well begun Tranio Sir a word ere you go Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of yea or no And if I be sir is it any offence No if without more words you will get you hence Why sir I pray are not the streets as free For me as for you But so is not she For what reason I beseech you For this reason if you 'll know That she 's the choice love of Signior Gremio That she 's the chosen of Signior Hortensio Softly my masters If you be gentlemen Do me this right- hear me with patience Baptista is a noble gentleman To whom my father is not all unknown And were his daughter fairer than she is She may more suitors have and me for one Fair Leda 's daughter had a thousand wooers Then well one more may fair Bianca have And so she shall Lucentio shall make one Though Paris came in hope to speed alone What this gentleman will out talk us all Sir give him head I know he 'll prove a jade Hortensio to what end are all these words Sir let me be so bold as ask you Did you yet ever see Baptista 's daughter No sir but hear I do that he hath two The one as famous for a scolding tongue As is the other for beauteous modesty Sir sir the first 's for me let her go by Yea leave that labour to great Hercules And let it be more than Alcides ' twelve Sir understand you this of me in sooth The youngest daughter whom you hearken for Her father keeps from all access of suitors And will not promise her to any man Until the elder sister first be we d. The younger then is free and not before If it be so sir that you are the man Must stead us all and me amongst the rest And if you break the ice and do this feat Achieve the elder set the younger free For our access- whose hap shall be to have her Will not so graceless be to be ingrate Sir you say well and well you do conceive And since you do profess to be a suitor You must as we do gratify this gentleman To whom we all rest generally beholding Sir I shall not be slack in sign whereof Please ye we may contrive this afternoon And quaff carouses to our mistress ' health And do as adversaries do in law- Strive mightily but eat and drink as friends The motion 's good indeed and be it so Petruchio I shall be your ben venuto Exeunt Good sister wrong me not nor wrong yourself To make a bondmaid and a slave of me- That I disdain but for these other gawds Unbind my hands I 'll pull them off myself Yea all my raiment to my petticoat Or what you will command me will I do So well I know my duty to my elders Of all thy suitors here I charge thee tell Whom thou lov'st best See thou dissemble not Believe me sister of all the men alive I never yet beheld that special face Which I could fancy more than any other Minion thou liest Is't not Hortensio If you affect him sister here I swear I 'll plead for you myself but you shall have him O then belike you fancy riches more You will have Gremio to keep you fair Is it for him you do envy me so Nay then you jest and now I well perceive You have but jested with me all this while I prithee sister Kate untie my hands Strikes her If that be jest then an the rest was so Why how now dame Whence grows this insolence Bianca stand aside- poor girl she weeps Her silence flouts me and I 'll be reveng'd What in my sight Bianca get thee in What will you not suffer me Nay now I see She is your treasure she must have a husband I must dance bare foot on her wedding day And for your love to her lead apes in hell Talk not to me I will go sit and weep Till I can find occasion of revenge Exit KATHERINA Was ever gentleman thus griev'd as I But who comes here Good morrow neighbour Baptista Good morrow neighbour Gremio God save you gentlemen And you good sir Pray have you not a daughter Call'd Katherina fair and virtuous I have a daughter sir call'd Katherina You are too blunt go to it orderly You wrong me Signior Gremio give me leave I am a gentleman of Verona sir That hearing of her beauty and her wit Her affability and bashful modesty Her wondrous qualities and mild behaviour Am bold to show myself a forward guest Within your house to make mine eye the witness Of that report which I so oft have heard And for an entrance to my entertainment I do present you with a man of mine Y'are welcome sir and he for your good sake But for my daughter Katherine this I know She is not for your turn the more my grief I see you do not mean to part with her Or else you like not of my company Mistake me not I speak but as I find Whence are you sir What may I call your name Petruchio is my name Antonio 's son A man well known throughout all Italy I know him well you are welcome for his sake Saving your tale Petruchio I pray Let us that are poor petitioners speak too Bacare you are marvellous forward O pardon me Signior Gremio I would fain be doing I doubt it not sir but you will curse your wooing Neighbour this is a gift very grateful I am sure of it To express the like kindness myself that have been more kindly beholding to you than any freely give unto you this young scholar Presenting LUCENTIO that hath been long studying at Rheims as cunning in Greek Latin and other languages as the other in music and mathematics His name is Cambio Pray accept his service A thousand thanks Signior Gremio Welcome good Cambio To TRANIO But gentle sir methinks you walk like a stranger May I be so bold to know the cause of your coming Pardon me sir the boldness is mine own That being a stranger in this city here Do make myself a suitor to your daughter Unto Bianca fair and virtuous Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me In the preferment of the eldest sister This liberty is all that I request- That upon knowledge of my parentage I may have welcome ' mongst the rest that woo And free access and favour as the rest And toward the education of your daughters I here bestow a simple instrument And this small packet of Greek and Latin books If you accept them then their worth is great Lucentio is your name Of whence I pray Of Pisa sir son to Vincentio A mighty man of Pisa By report I know him well You are very welcome sir Take you the lute and you the set of books You shall go see your pupils presently Holla within Signior Baptista my business asketh haste And every day I can not come to woo You knew my father well and in him me Left solely heir to all his lands and goods Which I have bettered rather than decreas'd Then tell me if I get your daughter 's love What dowry shall I have with her to wife After my death the one half of my lands And in possession twenty thousand crowns And for that dowry I 'll assure her of Her widowhood be it that she survive me In all my lands and leases whatsoever Let specialities be therefore drawn between us That covenants may be kept on either hand Ay when the special thing is well obtain'd That is her love for that is all in all Why that is nothing for I tell you father I am as peremptory as she proud minded And where two raging fires meet together They do consume the thing that feeds their fury Though little fire grows great with little wind Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all So I to her and so she yields to me For I am rough and woo not like a babe Well mayst thou woo and happy be thy speed But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words Ay to the proof as mountains are for winds That shake not though they blow perpetually How now my friend Why dost thou look so pale For fear I promise you if I look pale What will my daughter prove a good musician I think she 'll sooner prove a soldier Iron may hold with her but never lutes Why then thou canst not break her to the lute Why no for she hath broke the lute to me I did but tell her she mistook her frets And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering When with a most impatient devilish spirit ' Frets call you these ' quoth she ' I 'll fume with them ' And with that word she struck me on the head And through the instrument my pate made way And there I stood amazed for a while As on a pillory looking through the lute While she did call me rascal fiddler And twangling Jack with twenty such vile terms As she had studied to misuse me so Now by the world it is a lusty wench I love her ten times more than e'er I did O how I long to have some chat with her Well go with me and be not so discomfited Proceed in practice with my younger daughter She 's apt to learn and thankful for good turns Signior Petruchio will you go with us Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you I pray you do Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO I 'll attend her here And woo her with some spirit when she comes Say that she rail why then I 'll tell her plain She sings as sweetly as a nightingale Say that she frown I 'll say she looks as clear As morning roses newly wash'd with dew Say she be mute and will not speak a word Then I 'll commend her volubility And say she uttereth piercing eloquence If she do bid me pack I 'll give her thanks As though she bid me stay by her a week If she deny to we d I 'll crave the day When I shall ask the banns and when be married But here she comes Lnd.now Petruchio speak Well have you heard but something hard of hearing They call me Katherine that do talk of me You lie in faith for you are call'd plain Kate And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst But Kate the prettiest Kate in Christendom Kate of Kate Hall my super dainty Kate For dainties are all Kates and therefore Kate Take this of me Kate of my consolation- Hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town Thy virtues spoke of and thy beauty sounded Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs Myself am mov'd to woo thee for my wife Mov'd in good time Let him that mov'd you hither Remove you hence I knew you at the first You were a moveable Why what 's a moveable A join'd stool Thou hast hit it Come sit on me Asses are made to bear and so are you Women are made to bear and so are you No such jade as you if me you mean Alas good Kate I will not burden thee For knowing thee to be but young and light- Too light for such a swain as you to catch And yet as heavy as my weight should be Should be should- buzz Well ta'en and like a buzzard O slow wing'd turtle shall a buzzard take thee Ay for a turtle as he takes a buzzard Come come you wasp i ' faith you are too angry If I be waspish best beware my sting My remedy is then to pluck it out Ay if the fool could find it where it lies Who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting In his tail In his tongue Whose tongue Yours if you talk of tales and so farewell What with my tongue in your tail Nay come again Good Kate I am a gentleman That I 'll try She strikes him I swear I 'll cuff you if you strike again So may you lose your arms If you strike me you are no gentleman And if no gentleman why then no arms A herald Kate O put me in thy books What is your crest- a coxcomb A combless cock so Kate will be my hen No cock of mine you crow too like a craven Nay come Kate come you must not look so sour It is my fashion when I see a crab Why here 's no crab and therefore look not sour There is there is Then show it me Had I a glass I would What you mean my face Well aim'd of such a young one Now by Saint George I am too young for you Yet you are wither'd ' Tis with cares I care not Nay hear you Kate- in sooth you scape not so I chafe you if I tarry let me go No not a whit I find you passing gentle ' Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen And now I find report a very liar For thou art pleasant gamesome passing courteous But slow in speech yet sweet as springtime flowers Thou canst not frown thou canst not look askance Nor bite the lip as angry wenches will Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers With gentle conference soft and affable Why does the world report that Kate doth limp O sland'rous world Kate like the hazel twig Is straight and slender and as brown in hue As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels O let me see thee walk Thou dost not halt Go fool and whom thou keep'st command Did ever Dian so become a grove As Kate this chamber with her princely gait O be thou Dian and let her be Kate And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful Where did you study all this goodly speech It is extempore from my mother wit A witty mother witless else her son Am I not wise Yes keep you warm Marry so I mean sweet Katherine in thy bed And therefore setting all this chat aside Thus in plain terms your father hath consented That you shall be my wife your dowry greed on And will you nill you I will marry you Now Kate I am a husband for your turn For by this light whereby I see thy beauty Thy beauty that doth make me like thee well Thou must be married to no man but me For I am he am born to tame you Kate And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate Conformable as other household Kates Now Signior Petruchio how speed you with my daughter How but well sir how but well It were impossible I should speed amiss Why how now daughter Katherine in your dumps Call you me daughter Now I promise you You have show'd a tender fatherly regard To wish me we d to one half lunatic A mad cap ruffian and a swearing Jack That thinks with oaths to face the matter out Father ' tis thus yourself and all the world That talk'd of her have talk'd amiss of her If she be curst it is for policy For she 's not froward but modest as the dove She is not hot but temperate as the morn For patience she will prove a second Grissel And Roman Lucrece for her chastity And to conclude we have ' greed so well together That upon Sunday is the wedding day I 'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first Hark Petruchio she says she 'll see thee hang'd first Is this your speeding Nay then good night our part Be patient gentlemen I choose her for myself If she and I be pleas'd what 's that to you ' Tis bargain'd ' twixt us twain being alone That she shall still be curst in company I tell you ' tis incredible to believe How much she loves me- O the kindest Kate She hung about my neck and kiss on kiss She vied so fast protesting oath on oath That in a twink she won me to her love O you are novices ' Tis a world to see How tame when men and women are alone A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew Give me thy hand Kate I will unto Venice To buy apparel ' gainst the wedding day Provide the feast father and bid the guests I will be sure my Katherine shall be fine I know not what to say but give me your hands God send you joy Petruchio ' Tis a match Father and wife and gentlemen adieu I will to Venice Sunday comes apace We will have rings and things and fine array And kiss me Kate we will be married a Sunday Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly Faith gentlemen now I play a merchant 's part And venture madly on a desperate mart ' Twas a commodity lay fretting by you ' Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas The gain I seek is quiet in the match No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch But now Baptista to your younger daughter Now is the day we long have looked for I am your neighbour and was suitor first And I am one that love Bianca more Than words can witness or your thoughts can guess Youngling thou canst not love so dear as I. Greybeard thy love doth freeze But thine doth fry Skipper stand back ' tis age that nourisheth But youth in ladies ' eyes that flourisheth Content you gentlemen I will compound this strife ' Tis deeds must win the prize and he of both That can assure my daughter greatest dower Shall have my Bianca 's love Say Signior Gremio what can you assure her First as you know my house within the city Is richly furnished with plate and gold Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns In cypress chests my arras counterpoints Costly apparel tents and canopies Fine linen Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl Valance of Venice gold in needle work Pewter and brass and all things that belongs To house or housekeeping Then at my

Tis in my head to do my master good I see no reason but suppos'd Lucentio Must get a father call'd suppos'd Vincentio And that 's a wonder- fathers commonly Do get their children but in this case of wooing A child shall get a sire if I fail not of my cunning Fiddler forbear you grow too forward sir Have you so soon forgot the entertainment Her sister Katherine welcome'd you withal But wrangling

hours nor ' pointed times But learn my lessons as I please myself And to cut off all strife here sit we down Take you your instrument play you the whiles His lecture will be done ere you have tun'd You 'll leave his lecture when I am in tune That will be never- tune your instrument Where left we last Here madam ' Hic ibat Simois hic est Sigeia tellus Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis '

leave Are you so formal sir Well I must wait Aside And watch withal for but I be deceiv'd Our fine musician groweth amorous Madam before you touch the instrument To learn the order of my fingering I must begin with rudiments of art To teach you gamut in a briefer sort More pleasant pithy and effectual Than hath been taught by any of my trade And there it is in writing fairly drawn Why I am past my gamut long ago Yet read the gamut of Hortensio Reads Mistress your father prays you leave your books And help to dress your sister 's chamber up You know to morrow is the wedding day Farewell sweet masters both I must be gone Faith mistress then I have no cause to stay But I have cause to pry into this pedant Methinks he looks as though he were in love Yet if thy thoughts Bianca be so humble To cast thy wand'ring eyes on every stale- Seize thee that list If once I find thee ranging To TRANIO Signior Lucentio this is the ' pointed day That Katherine and Petruchio should be married And yet we hear not of our son in law What will be said What mockery will it be To want the bridegroom when the priest attends To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage What says Lucentio to this shame of ours No shame but mine I must forsooth be forc'd To give my hand oppos'd against my heart Unto a mad brain rudesby full of spleen Who woo'd in haste and means to we d at leisure I told you I he was a frantic fool Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour And to be noted for a merry man He 'll woo a thousand ' point the day of marriage Make friends invited and proclaim the banns Yet never means to we d where he hath woo'd Now must the world point at poor Katherine And say ' Lo there is mad Petruchio 's wife If it would please him come and marry her ' Patience good Katherine and Baptista too Upon my life Petruchio means but well Whatever fortune stays him from his word Though he be blunt I know him passing wise Though he be merry yet withal he 's honest Would Katherine had never seen him though Go girl I can not blame thee now to weep For such an injury would vex a very saint Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour Is it new and old too How may that be Why is it not news to hear of Petruchio 's coming Is he come Why no sir What then He is coming When will he be here When he stands where I am and sees you there But say what to thine old news Why Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old jerkin a pair of old breeches thrice turn'd a pair of boots that have been candle cases one buckled another lac'd an old rusty sword ta'en out of the town armoury with a broken hilt and chapeless with two broken points his horse hipp'd with an old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred besides possess'd with the glanders and like to mose in the chine troubled with the lampass infected with the fashions full of windgalls sped with spavins rayed with the yellows past cure of the fives stark spoil'd with the staggers begnawn with the bots sway'd in the back and shoulder shotten near legg'd before and with a half cheek'd bit and a head stall of sheep 's leather which being restrained to keep him from stumbling hath been often burst and now repaired with knots one girth six times piec'd and a woman 's crupper of velure which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs and here and there piec'd with pack thread Who comes with him O sir his lackey for all the world caparison'd like the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot hose on the other gart'red with a red and blue list an old hat and the humour of forty fancies prick'd in't for a feather a monster a very monster in apparel and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman 's lackey ' Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion Yet oftentimes lie goes but mean apparell'd I am glad he 's come howsoe'er he comes Why sir he comes not Didst thou not say he comes Who that Petruchio came Ay that Petruchio came No sir I say his horse comes with him on his back Why that 's all one Nay by Saint Jamy Come where be these gallants Who 's at home You are welcome sir And yet I come not well And yet you halt not Not so well apparell'd As I wish you were Were it better I should rush in thus But where is Kate Where is my lovely bride How does my father Gentles methinks you frown And wherefore gaze this goodly company As if they saw some wondrous monument Some comet or unusual prodigy Why sir you know this is your wedding day First were we sad fearing you would not come Now sadder that you come so unprovided Fie doff this habit shame to your estate An eye sore to our solemn festival And tell us what occasion of import Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife And sent you hither so unlike yourself Tedious it were to tell and harsh to hear Sufficeth I am come to keep my word Though in some part enforced to digress Which at more leisure I will so excuse As you shall well be satisfied withal But where is Kate I stay too long from her The morning wears ' tis time we were at church See not your bride in these unreverent robes Go to my chamber put on clothes of mine Not I believe me thus I 'll visit her But thus I trust you will not marry her Good sooth even thus therefore ha ' done with words To me she 's married not unto my clothes Could I repair what she will wear in me As I can change these poor accoutrements ' Twere well for Kate and better for myself But what a fool am I to chat with you When I should bid good morrow to my bride And seal the title with a lovely kiss He hath some meaning in his mad attire We will persuade him be it possible To put on better ere he go to church I 'll after him and see the event of this But to her love concerneth us to ad Her father 's liking which to bring to pass As I before imparted to your worship I am to get a man- whate'er he be It skills not much we 'll fit him to our turn- And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa And make assurance here in Padua Of greater sums than I have promised So shall you quietly enjoy your hope And marry sweet Bianca with consent Were it not that my fellow schoolmaster Doth watch Bianca 's steps so narrowly ' Twere good methinks to steal our marriage Which once perform'd let all the world say no I 'll keep mine own despite of all the world That by degrees we mean to look into And watch our vantage in this business We 'll over reach the greybeard Gremio The narrow prying father Minola The quaint musician amorous Licio- All for my master 's sake Lucentio As willingly as e'er I came from school And is the bride and bridegroom coming home A bridegroom say you ' Tis a groom indeed A grumbling groom and that the girl shall find Curster than she Why ' tis impossible Why he 's a devil a devil a very fiend Why she 's a devil a devil the devil 's dam Tut she 's a lamb a dove a fool to him I 'll tell you Sir Lucentio when the priest Should ask if Katherine should be his wife ' Ay by gogs wouns ' quoth he and swore so loud That all amaz'd the priest let fall the book And as he stoop'd again to take it up This mad brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff That down fell priest and book and book and priest ' Now take them up ' quoth he ' if any list ' What said the wench when he rose again Trembled and shook for why he stamp'd and swore As if the vicar meant to cozen him But after many ceremonies done He calls for wine ' A health ' quoth he as if He had been abroad carousing to his mates After a storm quaff'd off the muscadel And threw the sops all in the sexton 's face Having no other reason But that his beard grew thin and hungerly And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking This done he took the bride about the neck And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack That at the parting all the church did echo And I seeing this came thence for very shame And after me I know the rout is coming Such a mad marriage never was before Hark hark I hear the minstrels play Music plays Gentlemen and friends I thank you for your pains I know you think to dine with me to day And have prepar'd great store of wedding cheer But so it is- my haste doth call me hence And therefore here I mean to take my leave Is't possible you will away to night I must away

sweet and virtuous wife Dine with my father drink a health to me For I must hence and farewell to you all Let us entreat you stay till after dinner It may not be Let me entreat you It can not be Let me entreat you I am content Are you content to stay I am content you shall entreat me stay But yet not stay entreat me how you can Now if you love me stay Grumio my horse Ay sir they be ready the oats have eaten the horses Nay then Do what thou canst I will not go to day No nor to morrow not till I please myself The door is open sir there lies your way You may be jogging whiles your boots are green For me I 'll not be gone till I please myself ' Tis like you 'll prove a jolly surly groom That take it on you at the first so roundly O Kate content thee prithee be not angry I will be angry what hast thou to do Father be quiet he shall stay my leisure Ay marry sir now it begins to work Gentlemen forward to the bridal dinner I see a woman may be made a fool If she had not a spirit to resist They shall go forward Kate at thy command Obey the bride you that attend on her Go to the feast revel and domineer Carouse full measure to her maidenhead Be mad and merry or go hang yourselves But for

carpets laid and everything in order All ready and therefore I pray thee news First know my horse is tired my master and mistress fall'n out How Out of their saddles into the dirt and thereby hangs a tale Let 's ha't good Grumio Lend thine ear Here There Striking him This ' tis to feel a tale not to hear a tale And therefore ' tis call'd a sensible tale and this cuff was but to knock at your car and beseech list'ning Now I begin Imprimis we came down a foul hill my master riding behind my mistress- Both of one horse What 's that to thee Why a horse Tell thou the tale But hadst thou not cross'd me thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place how she was bemoil'd how he left her with the horse upon her how he beat me because her horse stumbled how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me how he swore how she pray'd that never pray'd before how I cried how the horses ran away how her bridle was burst how I lost my crupper- with many things of worthy memory which now shall die in oblivion and thou return unexperienc'd to thy grave By this reck'ning he is more shrew than she Ay and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home But what talk I of this Call forth Nathaniel Joseph Nicholas Philip Walter Sugarsop and the rest let their heads be sleekly comb'd their blue coats brush'd and their garters of an indifferent knit let them curtsy with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair of my mastcr 's horse tail till they kiss their hands Are they all ready They are Call them forth Do you hear ho You must meet my master to countenance my mistress Why she hath a face of her own Who knows not that Thou it seems that calls for company to countenance her I call them forth to credit her Why she comes to borrow nothing of them Welcome home Grumio How now Grumio What Grumio Fellow Grumio How now old lad Welcome you!- how now you!- what you!- fellow you!- and thus much for greeting Now my spruce companions is all ready and all things neat All things is ready How near is our master E'en at hand alighted by this and therefore be not- Where be these knaves What no man at door To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse Where is Nathaniel Gregory Philip Here here sir here sir Here sir here sir here sir here sir You logger headed and unpolish'd grooms What no attendance no regard no duty Where is the foolish knave I sent before Here sir as foolish as I was before YOU peasant swain you whoreson malt horse drudge Did I not bid thee meet me in the park And bring along these rascal knaves with thee Nathaniel 's coat sir was not fully made And Gabriel 's pumps were all unpink'd i ' th ' heel There was no link to colour Peter 's hat And Walter 's dagger was not come from sheathing There were none fine but Adam Ralph and Gregory The rest were ragged old and beggarly Yet as they are here are they come to meet you Go rascals go and fetch my supper in Patience I pray you ' twas a fault unwilling A whoreson beetle headed flap ear'd knave Come Kate sit down I know you have a stomach Will you give thanks sweet Kate or else shall I What 's this Mutton Ay Who brought it I. ' Tis burnt and so is all the meat What dogs are these Where is the rascal cook How durst you villains bring it from the dresser And serve it thus to me that love it not There take it to you trenchers cups and all I pray you husband be not so disquiet The meat was well if you were so contented I tell thee Kate ' twas burnt and dried away And I expressly am forbid to touch it For it engenders choler planteth anger And better ' twere that both of us did fast Since of ourselves ourselves are choleric Than feed it with such over roasted flesh Be patient to morrow ' t shall be mended And for this night we 'll fast for company Come I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber Exeunt Peter didst ever see the like He kills her in her own humour Where is he In her chamber Making a sermon of continency to her And rails and swears and rates that she poor soul Knows not which way to stand to look to speak And sits as one new risen from a dream Away away for he is coming hither Exeunt Thus have I politicly begun my reign And ' tis my hope to end successfully My falcon now is sharp and passing empty And till she stoop she must not be full gorg'd For then she never looks upon her lure Another way I have to man my haggard To make her come and know her keeper 's call That is to watch her as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient She eat no meat to day nor none shall eat Last night she slept not nor to night she shall not As with the meat some undeserved fault I 'll find about the making of the bed And here I 'll fling the pillow there the bolster This way the coverlet another way the sheets Ay and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her- And in conclusion she shall watch all night And if she chance to nod I 'll rail and brawl And with the clamour keep her still awake This is a way to kill a wife with kindness And thus I 'll curb her mad and headstrong humour He that knows better how to tame a shrew Now let him speak ' tis charity to show Exit Is ' t possible friend Licio that Mistress Bianca Doth fancy any other but Lucentio I tell you sir she bears me fair in hand Sir to satisfy you in what I have said Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching Now mistress profit you in what you read What master read you First resolve me that I read that I profess ' The Art to Love ' And may you prove sir master of your art While you sweet dear prove mistress of my heart Quick proceeders marry Now tell me I pray You that durst swear that your Mistress Blanca Lov'd none in the world so well as Lucentio O despiteful love unconstant womankind I tell thee Licio this is wonderful Mistake no more I am not Licio Nor a musician as I seem to be But one that scorn to live in this disguise For such a one as leaves a gentleman And makes a god of such a cullion Know sir that I am call'd Hortensio Signior Hortensio I have often heard Of your entire affection to Bianca And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness I will with you if you be so contented Forswear Bianca and her love for ever See how they kiss and court Signior Lucentio Here is my hand and here I firmly vow Never to woo her more but do forswear her As one unworthy all the former favours That I have fondly flatter'd her withal And here I take the like unfeigned oath Never to marry with her though she would entreat Fie on her See how beastly she doth court him Would all the world but he had quite forsworn For me that I may surely keep mine oath I will be married to a wealtlly widow Ere three days pass which hath as long lov'd me As I have lov'd this proud disdainful haggard And so farewell Signior Lucentio Kindness in women not their beauteous looks Shall win my love and so I take my leave In resolution as I swore before Exit Mistress Bianca bless you with such grace As ' longeth to a lover 's blessed case Nay I have ta'en you napping gentle love And have forsworn you with Hortensio Tranio you jest but have you both forsworn me Mistress we have Then we are rid of Licio I ' faith he 'll have a lusty widow now That shall be woo'd and wedded in a day God give him joy Ay and he 'll tame her He says so Tranio Faith he is gone unto the taming school The taming school What is there such a place Ay mistress and Petruchio is the master That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue O master master have watch'd so long That I am dog weary but at last I spied An ancient angel coming down the hill Will serve the turn What is he Biondello Master a mercatante or a pedant I know not what but formal in apparel In gait and countenance surely like a father And what of him Tranio If he be credulous and trust my tale I 'll make him glad to seem Vincentio And give assurance to Baptista Minola As if he were the right Vincentio Take in your love and then let me alone God save you sir And you sir you are welcome Travel you far on or are you at the farthest Sir at the farthest for a week or two But then up farther and as far as Rome And so to Tripoli if God lend me life What countryman I pray Of Mantua Of Mantua sir Marry God forbid And come to Padua careless of your life My life sir How I pray For that goes hard ' Tis death for any one in Mantua To come to Padua Know you not the cause Your ships are stay'd at Venice and the Duke For private quarrel ' twixt your Duke and him Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly ' Tis marvel- but that you are but newly come You might have heard it else proclaim'd about Alas sir it is worse for me than so For I have bills for money by exchange From Florence and must here deliver them Well sir to do you courtesy This will I do and this I will advise you- First tell me have you ever been at Pisa Ay sir in Pisa have I often been Pisa renowned for grave citizens Among them know you one Vincentio I know him not but I have heard of him A merchant of incomparable wealth He is my father sir and sooth to say In count'nance somewhat doth resemble you Aside As much as an apple doth an oyster and all one To save your life in this extremity This favour will I do you for his sake And think it not the worst of all your fortunes That you are like to Sir Vincentio His name and credit shall you undertake And in my house you shall be friendly lodg'd Look that you take upon you as you should You understand me sir So shall you stay Till you have done your business in the city If this be court'sy sir accept of it O sir I do and will repute you ever The patron of my life and liberty Then go with me to make the matter good This by the way I let you understand My father is here look'd for every day To pass assurance of a dow'r in marriage ' Twixt me and one Baptista 's daughter here In all these circumstances I 'll instruct you Go with me to clothe you as becomes you Exeunt No no forsooth I dare not for my life The more my wrong the more his spite appears What did he marry me to famish me Beggars that come unto my father 's door Upon entreaty have a present alms If not elsewhere they meet with charity But I who never knew how to entreat Nor never needed that I should entreat Am starv'd for meat giddy for lack of sleep With oaths kept waking and with brawling fed And that which spites me more than all these wants- He does it under name of perfect love As who should say if I should sleep or eat ' Twere deadly sickness or else present death I prithee go and get me some repast I care not what so it be wholesome food What say you to a neat 's foot ' Tis passing good I prithee let me have it I fear it is too choleric a meat How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd I like it well good Grumio fetch it me I can not tell I fear ' tis choleric What say you to a piece of beef and mustard A dish that I do love to feed upon Ay but the mustard is too hot a little Why then the beef and let the mustard rest Nay then I will not you shall have the mustard Or else you get no beef of Grumio Then both or one or anything thou wilt Why then the mustard without the beef Go get thee gone thou false deluding slave How fares my Kate What sweeting all amort Mistress what cheer Faith as cold as can be Pluck up thy spirits look cheerfully upon me Here love thou seest how diligent I am To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee I am sure sweet Kate this kindness merits thanks What not a word Nay then thou lov'st it not And all my pains is sorted to no proof Here take away this dish I pray you let it stand The poorest service is repaid with thanks And so shall mine before you touch the meat I thank you sir Signior Petruchio fie you are to blame Come Mistress Kate I 'll bear you company Aside Eat it up all Hortensio if thou lovest me.- Much good do it unto thy gentle heart Kate eat apace And now my honey love Will we return unto thy father 's house And revel it as bravely as the best With silken coats and caps and golden rings With ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and things With scarfs and fans and double change of brav'ry With amber bracelets beads and all this knav'ry What hast thou din'd The tailor stays thy leisure To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure Here is the cap your worship did bespeak Why this was moulded on a porringer A velvet dish Fie fie ' tis lewd and filthy Why ' tis a cockle or a walnut shell A knack a toy a trick a baby 's cap Away with it Come let me have a bigger I 'll have no bigger this doth fit the time And gentlewomen wear such caps as these When you are gentle you shall have one too And not till then Aside That will not be in haste Why sir I trust I may have leave to speak And speak I will I am no child no babe Your betters have endur'd me say my mind And if you can not best you stop your ears My tongue will tell the anger of my heart Or else my heart concealing it will break And rather than it shall I will be free Even to the uttermost as I please in words Why thou say'st true it is a paltry cap A custard coffin a bauble a silken pie I love thee well in that thou lik'st it not Love me or love me not I like the cap And it I will have or I will have none Exit HABERDASHER Thy gown Why ay Come tailor let us see't O mercy God what masquing stuff is here What 's this A sleeve ' Tis like a demi cannon What up and down carv'd like an appletart Here 's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash Like to a censer in a barber 's shop Why what a devil 's name tailor call'st thou this Aside I see she 's like to have neither cap nor gown You bid me make it orderly and well According to the fashion and the time Marry and did but if you be rememb'red I did not bid you mar it to the time Go hop me over every kennel home For you shall hop without my custom sir I 'll none of it hence make your best of it I never saw a better fashion'd gown More quaint more pleasing nor more commendable Belike you mean to make a puppet of me Why true he means to make a puppet of thee She says your worship means to make a puppet of her O monstrous arrogance Thou liest thou thread thou Your worship is deceiv'd the gown is made Just as my master had direction Grumio gave order how it should be done I gave him no order I gave him the stuff But how did you desire it should be made Marry sir with needle and thread But did you not request to have it cut Thou hast fac'd many things I have Face not me Thou hast brav'd many men brave not me I will neither be fac'd nor brav'd I say unto thee I bid thy master cut out the gown but I did not bid him cut it to pieces Ergo thou liest Why here is the note of the fashion to testify Read it The note lies in 's throat if he say I said so Reads ' Imprimis a loose bodied gown'- Master if ever I said loose bodied gown sew me in the skirts of it and beat me to death with a bottom of brown bread I said a gown Proceed Reads ' With a small compass'd cape'- I confess the cape Reads ' With a trunk sleeve'- I confess two sleeves Reads ' The sleeves curiously cut ' Ay there 's the villainy Error i ' th ' bill sir error i ' th ' bill I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and sew'd up again and that I 'll prove upon thee though thy little finger be armed in a thimble This is true that I say an I had thee in place where thou shouldst know it I am for thee straight take thou the bill give me thy meteyard and spare not me God a mercy Grumio Then he shall have no odds Well sir in brief the gown is not for me You are i ' th ' right sir ' tis for my mistress Go take it up unto thy master 's use Villain not for thy life Take up my mistress ' gown for thy master 's use Why sir what 's your conceit in that O sir the conceit is deeper than you think for Take up my mistress ' gown to his master 's use O fie fie fie Aside Hortensio say thou wilt see the tailor paid.- Go take it hence be gone and say no more Tailor I 'll pay thee for thy gown to morrow Take no unkindness of his hasty words Away I say commend me to thy master Exit TAILOR Well come my Kate we will unto your father 's Even in these honest mean habiliments Our purses shall be proud our garments poor For ' tis the mind that makes the body rich And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds So honour peereth in the meanest habit What is the jay more precious than the lark Because his feathers are more beautiful Or is the adder better than the eel Because his painted skin contents the eye O no good Kate neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array If thou account'st it shame lay it on me And therefore frolic we will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father 's house Go call my men and let us straight to him And bring our horses unto Long lane end There will we mount and thither walk on foot Let 's see I think ' tis now some seven o'clock And well we may come there by dinner time I

alone I will not go to day and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is Why so this gallant will command the sun Sir this is the house please it you that I call Ay what else And but I be deceived Signior Baptista may remember me Near twenty years ago in Genoa Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus ' Tis well and hold your own in any case With such austerity as longeth to a father I warrant you But sir here comes your boy ' Twere good he were school'd Fear you not him Sirrah Biondello Now do your duty throughly I advise you Imagine ' twere the right Vincentio Tut fear not me But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista I told him that your father was at Venice And that you look'd for him this day in Padua Th'art a tall fellow hold thee that to drink Here comes Baptista Set your countenance sir Soft son Sir by your leave having come to Padua To gather in some debts my son Lucentio Made me acquainted with a weighty cause Of love between your daughter and himself And- for the good report I hear of you And for the love he beareth to your daughter And she to him- to stay him not too long I am content in a good father 's care To have him match'd and if you please to like No worse than I upon some agreement Me shall you find ready and willing With one consent to have her so bestow'd For curious I can not be with you Signior Baptista of whom I hear so well Sir pardon me in what I have to say Your plainness and your shortness please me well Right true it is your son Lucentio here Doth love my daughter and she loveth him Or both dissemble deeply their affections And therefore if you say no more than this That like a father you will deal with him And pass my daughter a sufficient dower The match is made and all is done- Your son shall have my daughter with consent I thank you sir Where then do you know best We be affied and such assurance ta'en As shall with either part 's agreement stand Not in my house Lucentio for you know Pitchers have ears and I have many servants Besides old Gremio is heark'ning still And happily we might be interrupted Then at my lodging an it like you There doth my father lie and there this night We 'll pass the business privately and well Send for your daughter by your servant here My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently The worst is this that at so slender warning You are like to have a thin and slender pittance It likes me well Cambio hie you home And bid Bianca make her ready straight And if you will tell what hath happened- Lucentio 's father is arriv'd in Padua And how she 's like to be Lucentio 's wife Exit LUCENTIO I pray the gods she may with all my heart Dally not with the gods but get thee gone I follow you Exeunt Cambio What say'st thou Biondello You saw my master wink and laugh upon you Biondello what of that Faith nothing but has left me here behind to expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens I pray thee moralize them Then thus Baptista is safe talking with the deceiving father of a deceitful son And what of him His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper And then The old priest at Saint Luke 's church is at your command at all hours And what of all this I can not tell except they are busied about a counterfeit assurance Take your assurance of her cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum to th ' church take the priest clerk and some sufficient honest witnesses If this be not that you look for I have more to say But bid Bianca farewell for ever and a day Hear'st thou Biondello I can not tarry I knew a wench married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit and so may you sir and so adieu sir My master hath appointed me to go to Saint Luke 's to bid the priest be ready to come against you come with your appendix I may and will if she be so contented She will be pleas'd then wherefore should I doubt Hap what hap may I 'll roundly go about her It shall go hard if Cambio go without her Exit Come on a God 's name once more toward our father 's Good Lord how bright and goodly shines the moon The moon The sun It is not moonlight now I say it is the moon that shines so bright I know it is the sun that shines so bright Now by my mother 's son and that 's myself It shall be moon or star or what I list Or ere I journey to your father 's house Go on and fetch our horses back again Evermore cross'd and cross'd nothing but cross'd Say as he says or we shall never go Forward I pray since we have come so far And be it moon or sun or what you please And if you please to call it a rush candle Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me I say it is the moon I know it is the moon Nay then you lie it is the blessed sun Then God be bless'd it is the blessed sun But sun it is not when you say it is not And the moon changes even as your mind What you will have it nam'd even that it is And so it shall be so for Katherine Petruchio go thy ways the field is won Well forward forward thus the bowl should run And not unluckily against the bias But soft Company is coming here ' A will make the man mad to make a woman of him Young budding virgin fair and fresh and sweet Whither away or where is thy abode Happy the parents of so fair a

O immortal gods O fine villain A silken doublet a velvet hose a scarlet cloak and a copatain hat O I am undone I am undone While I play the good husband at home my son and my servant spend all at the

once than never for never too late Exeunt At last though long our jarring notes agree And time it is when raging war is done To smile at scapes and perils overblown My fair Bianca bid my father welcome While I with self same kindness welcome thine Brother Petruchio sister Katherina And thou Hortensio with thy loving widow Feast with the best and welcome to my house My banquet is to close our stomachs up After our great good cheer Pray you sit down For now we sit to chat as well as eat They sit Nothing but sit and sit and eat and eat Padua affords this kindness son Petruchio Padua affords nothing but what is kind For both our sakes I would that word were true Now for my life Hortensio fears his widow Then never trust me if I be afeard YOU are very sensible and yet you miss my sense I mean Hortensio is afeard of you He that is giddy thinks the world turns round Roundly replied Mistress how mean you that Thus I conceive by him Conceives by me How likes Hortensio that My widow says thus she conceives her tale Very well mended Kiss him for that good widow ' He that is giddy thinks the world turns round ' I pray you tell me what you meant by that Your husband being troubled with a shrew Measures my husband 's sorrow by his woe And now you know my meaning A very mean meaning Right I mean you And I am mean indeed respecting you To her Kate To her widow A hundred marks my Kate does put her down That 's my office Spoke like an officer- ha ' to thee lad How likes Gremio these quick witted folks Believe me sir they butt together well Head and butt An hasty witted body Would say your head and butt were head and horn Ay mistress bride hath that awakened you Ay but not frighted me therefore I 'll sleep again Nay that you shall not since you have begun Have at you for a bitter jest or two Am I your bird I mean to shift my bush And then pursue me as you draw your bow You are welcome all She hath prevented me Here Signior Tranio This bird you aim'd at though you hit her not Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd O sir Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound Which runs himself and catches for his master A good swift simile but something currish ' Tis well

has a little gall'd me I confess And as the jest did glance away from me ' Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright Now in good sadness son Petruchio I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all Well I say no and therefore for assurance Let 's each one send unto his wife And he whose wife is most obedient To come at first when he doth send for her Shall win the wager which we will propose Content What 's the wager Twenty crowns Twenty crowns I 'll venture so much of my hawk or hound But twenty times so much upon my wife A hundred then Content A match ' tis done Who shall begin That will I. Go Biondello bid your mistress come to me I go Exit Son I 'll be your half Bianca comes I 'll have no halves I 'll bear it all myself Sir my mistress sends you word That she is busy and she can not come How She 's busy and she can not come Is that an answer Ay and a kind one too Pray God sir your wife send you not a worse I hope better Sirrah Biondello go and entreat my wife To come to me forthwith Exit BIONDELLO O ho entreat her Nay then she must needs come I am afraid sir Do what you can yours will not be entreated She says you have some goodly jest in hand She will not come she bids you come to her Worse and worse she will not come O vile Intolerable not to be endur'd Sirrah Grumio go to your mistress Say I command her come to me Exit GRUMIO I know her answer What She will not The fouler fortune mine and there an end Now by my holidame here comes Katherina What is your sir that you send for me Where is your sister and Hortensio 's wife They sit conferring by the parlour fire Go fetch them hither if they deny to come Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands Away I say and bring them hither straight Here is a wonder if you talk of a wonder And so it is I wonder what it bodes Marry peace it bodes and love and quiet life An awful rule and right supremacy And to be short what not that 's sweet and happy Now fair befall thee good Petruchio The wager thou hast won and I will ad Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns Another dowry to another daughter For she is chang'd as she had never been Nay I will win my wager better yet And show more sign of her obedience Her new built virtue and obedience Lord let me never have a cause to sigh Till I be brought to such a silly pass Fie what a foolish duty call you this I would your duty were as foolish too The wisdom of your duty fair Bianca Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper time The more fool you for laying on my duty Katherine I charge thee tell these headstrong women What duty they do owe their lords and husbands Come come you 're mocking we will have no telling Come on I say and first begin with her She shall not I say she shall And first begin with her Fie fie unknit that threatening unkind brow And dart not scornful glances from those eyes To wound thy lord thy king thy governor It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds And in no sense is meet or amiable A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled- Muddy ill seeming thick bereft of beauty And while it is so none so dry or thirsty Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it Thy husband is thy lord thy life thy keeper Thy head thy sovereign one that cares for thee And for thy maintenance commits his body To painful labour both by sea and land To watch the night in storms the day in cold Whilst thou liest warm at home secure and safe And craves no other tribute at thy hands But love fair looks and true obedience- Too little payment for so great a debt Such duty as the subject owes the prince Even such a woman oweth to her husband And when she is froward peevish sullen sour And not obedient to his honest will What is she but a foul contending rebel And graceless traitor to her loving lord I am asham'd that women are so simple To offer war where they should kneel for peace Or seek for rule supremacy and sway When they are bound to serve love and obey Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth Unapt to toll and trouble in the world But that our soft conditions and our hearts Should well agree with our external parts Come come you froward and unable worins My mind hath been as big as one of yours My heart as great my reason haply more To bandy word for word and frown for frown But now I see our lances are but straws Our strength as weak our weakness past compare That seeming to be most which we indeed least are Then vail your stomachs for it is no boot And place your hands below your husband 's foot In token of which duty if he please My hand is ready may it do him ease Why there 's a wench Come on and kiss me Kate Well go thy ways old lad for thou shalt ha't ' Tis a good hearing when children are toward But a harsh hearing when women are froward Come Kate we 'll to bed We three are married but you two are sped To LUCENTIO ' Twas I won the wager though you hit the white And being a winner God give you good night Now go thy ways thou hast tam'd a curst shrow ' Tis a wonder by your leave she will be tam'd so Boatswain Here master what cheer Good Speak to th ' mariners fall to't yarely or we run ourselves aground bestir bestir Exit Heigh my hearts cheerly cheerly my hearts yare yare Take in the topsail Tend to th ' master 's whistle Blow till thou burst thy wind if room enough Good boatswain have care Where 's the master Play the men I pray now keep below Where is the master boson Do you not hear him You mar our labour keep your cabins you do assist the storm Nay good be patient When the sea is Hence What cares these roarers for the name of king To cabin silence Trouble us not Good yet remember whom thou hast aboard None that I more love than myself You are counsellor if you can command these elements to silence and work the peace of the present we will not hand a rope more Use your authority if you can not give thanks you have liv'd so long and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour if it so hap.-Cheerly good hearts!-Out of our way I say I have great comfort from this fellow Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him his complexion is perfect gallows Stand fast good Fate to his hanging make the rope of his destiny our cable for our own doth little advantage If he be not born to be hang'd our case is miserable Exeunt Down with the topmast Yare lower lower Bring her to try wi ' th ' maincourse A cry within A plague upon this howling They are louder than the weather or our office A pox o ' your throat you bawling blasphemous incharitable dog Work you then Hang cur hang you whoreson insolent noisemaker we are less afraid to be drown'd than thou art I 'll warrant him for drowning though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench Lay her a hold a hold set her two courses off to sea again lay her off All lost to prayers to prayers all lost What must our mouths be cold The King and Prince at prayers Let 's assist them For our case is as theirs I am out of patience We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards This wide chopp'd rascal would thou mightst lie drowning The washing of ten tides He 'll be hang'd yet Though every drop of water swear against it And gape at wid'st to glut him A confused noise within Mercy on us We split we split Farewell my wife and children Farewell brother We split we split we split Let 's all sink wi ' th ' King Let 's take leave of him Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground long heath brown furze any thing The wills above be done but I would fain die dry death Exeunt If by your art my dearest father you have Put the wild waters in this roar allay them The sky it seems would pour down stinking pitch But that the sea mounting to th ' welkin 's cheek Dashes the fire out O I have suffered With those that I saw suffer A brave vessel Who had no doubt some noble creature in her Dash'd all to pieces O the cry did knock Against my very heart Poor souls they perish'd Had I been any god of power I would Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere It should the good ship so have swallow'd and The fraughting souls within her Be conected No more amazement tell your piteous heart There 's no harm done O woe the day No harm I have done nothing but in care of thee Of thee my dear one thee my daughter who Art ignorant of what thou art nought knowing Of whence I am nor that I am more better Than Prospero master of a full poor cell And thy no greater father More to know Did never meddle with my thoughts ' Tis time I should inform thee farther Lend thy hand And pluck my magic garment from me So You have often Begun to tell me what I am but stopp'd And left me to a bootless inquisition Concluding ' Stay not yet ' The hour 's now come The very minute bids thee ope thine ear Obey and be attentive Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell I do not think thou canst for then thou wast not Out three years old Certainly sir I can By what By any other house or person Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance ' Tis far off And rather like a dream than an assurance That my remembrance warrants Had I not Four or five women once that tended me Thou hadst and more Miranda But how is it That this lives in thy mind What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time If thou rememb'rest aught ere thou cam'st here How thou cam'st here thou mayst But that I do not Twelve year since Miranda twelve year since Thy father was the Duke of Milan and A prince of power Sir are not you my father Thy mother was a piece of virtue and She said thou wast my daughter and thy father Was Duke of Milan and his only heir And princess no worse issued O the heavens What foul play had we that we came from thence Or blessed was't we did Both both my girl By foul play as thou say'st were we heav'd thence But blessedly holp hither O my heart bleeds To think o ' th ' teen that I have turn'd you to Which is from my remembrance Please you farther My brother and thy uncle call'd Antonio- I pray thee mark me that a brother should Be so perfidious He whom next thyself Of all the world I lov'd and to him put The manage of my state as at that time Through all the signories it was the first And Prospero the prime duke being so reputed In dignity and for the liberal arts Without a parallel those being all my study- The government I cast upon my brother And to my state grew stranger being transported And rapt in secret studies Thy false uncle- Dost thou attend me Sir most heedfully Being once perfected how to grant suits How to deny them who t ' advance and who To trash for over topping new created The creatures that were mine I say or chang'd 'em Or else new form'd 'em having both the key Of officer and office set all hearts i ' th ' state To what tune pleas'd his ear that now he was The ivy which had hid my princely trunk And suck'd my verdure out on't Thou attend'st not O good sir I do I pray thee mark me I thus neglecting worldly ends all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind With that which but by being so retir'd O'er priz'd all popular rate in my false brother Awak'd an evil nature and my trust Like a good parent did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary as great As my trust was which had indeed no limit A confidence sans bound He being thus lorded Not only with what my revenue yielded But what my power might else exact like one Who having into truth by telling of it Made such a sinner of his memory To credit his own lie he did believe He was indeed the Duke out o ' th ' substitution And executing th ' outward face of royalty With all prerogative Hence his ambition growing- Dost thou hear Your tale sir would cure deafness To have no screen between this part he play'd And him he play'd it for he needs will be Absolute Milan Me poor man my library Was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties He thinks me now incapable confederates So dry he was for sway wi ' th ' King of Naples To give him annual tribute do him homage Subject his coronet to his crown and bend The dukedom yet unbow'd alas poor Milan!- To most ignoble stooping O the heavens Mark his condition and th ' event then tell me If this might be a brother I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother Good wombs have borne bad sons Now the condition This King of Naples being an enemy To me inveterate hearkens my brother 's suit Which was that he in lieu o ' th ' premises Of homage and I know not how much tribute Should presently extirpate me and mine Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan With all the honours on my brother Whereon A treacherous army levied one midnight Fated to th ' purpose did Antonio open The gates of Milan and i ' th ' dead of darkness The ministers for th ' purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self Alack for pity I not rememb'ring how I cried out then Will cry it o'er again it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to't Hear a little further And then I 'll bring thee to the present busines Which now 's upon 's without the which this story Were most impertinent Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us Well demanded wench My tale provokes that question Dear they durst not So dear the love my people bore me nor set A mark so bloody on the business but With colours fairer painted their foul ends In few they hurried us aboard a bark Bore us some leagues to sea where they prepared A rotten carcass of a butt not rigg'd Nor tackle sail nor mast the very rats Instinctively have quit it There they hoist us To cry to th ' sea that roar'd to us to sigh To th ' winds whose pity sighing back again Did us but loving wrong Alack what trouble Was I then to you O a cherubin Thou wast that did preserve me Thou didst smile Infused with a fortitude from heaven When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt Under my burden groan'd which rais'd in me An undergoing stomach to bear up Against what should ensue How came we ashore By Providence divine Some food we had and some fresh water that A noble Neapolitan Gonzalo Out of his charity who being then appointed Master of this design did give us with Rich garments linens stuffs and necessaries Which since have steaded much so of his gentleness Knowing I lov'd my books he furnish'd me From mine own library with volumes that I prize above my dukedom Would I might But ever see that man Now I arise Puts on his mantle Sit still and hear the last of our sea sorrow Here in this island we arriv'd and here Have I thy schoolmaster made thee more profit Than other princess ' can that have more time For vainer hours and tutors not so careful Heavens thank you for't And now I pray you Know thus far forth By accident most strange bountiful Fortune Now my dear lady hath mine enemies Brought to this shore and by my prescience I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star whose influence If now I court not but omit my fortunes Will ever after droop Here cease more questions Thou art inclin'd to sleep ' tis a good dullness And give it way I know thou canst not choose All hail great master grave sir hail I come To answer thy best pleasure be't to fly To swim to dive into the fire to ride On the curl'd clouds To thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality Hast thou spirit Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee To every article I boarded the King 's ship now on the beak Now in the waist the deck in every cabin I flam'd amazement Sometime I 'd divide And burn in many places on the topmast The yards and bowsprit would I flame distinctly Then meet and join Jove 's lightning the precursors O ' th ' dreadful thunder claps more momentary And sight outrunning were not the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble Yea his dread trident shake My brave spirit Who was so firm so constant that this coil Would not infect his reason Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad and play'd Some tricks of desperation All but mariners Plung'd in the foaming brine and quit the vessel Then all afire with me the King 's son Ferdinand With hair up staring then like reeds not hair- Was the first man that leapt cried ' Hell is empty And all the devils are here ' Why that 's my spirit But was not this nigh shore Close by my master But are they Ariel safe Not a hair perish'd On their sustaining garments not a blemish But fresher than before and as thou bad'st me In troops I have dispers'd them 'bout the isle The King 's son have I landed by himself Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle and sitting His arms in this sad knot Of the King 's ship The mariners say how thou hast dispos'd And all the rest o ' th ' fleet Safely in harbour Is the King 's ship in the deep nook where once Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still vex'd Bermoothes there she 's hid The mariners all under hatches stowed Who with a charm join'd to their suff'red labour I have left asleep and for the rest o ' th ' fleet Which I dispers'd they all have met again And are upon the Mediterranean flote Bound sadly home for Naples Supposing that they saw the King 's ship wreck'd And his great person perish Ariel thy charge Exactly is perform'd but there 's more work What is the time o ' th ' day Past the mid season At least two glasses The time ' twixt six and now Must by us both be spent most preciously Is there more toil Since thou dost give me pains Let me remember thee what thou hast promis'd Which is not yet perform'd me How now moody What is't thou canst demand My liberty Before the time be out No more I prithee Remember I have done thee worthy service Told thee no lies made thee no mistakings serv'd Without or grudge or grumblings Thou didst promise To bate me a full year Dost thou forget From what a torment I did free thee No Thou dost and think'st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep To run upon the sharp wind of the north To do me business in the veins o ' th ' earth When it is bak'd with frost I do not sir Thou liest malignant thing Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop Hast thou forgot her No sir Thou hast Where was she born Speak tell me Sir in Argier O was she so I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been Which thou forget'st This damn'd witch Sycorax For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing from Argier Thou know'st was banish'd for one thing she did They would not take her life Is not this true Ay sir This blue ey'd hag was hither brought with child And here was left by th'sailors Thou my slave As thou report'st thyself wast then her servant And for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands Refusing her grand hests she did confine thee By help of her more potent ministers And in her most unmitigable rage Into a cloven pine within which rift Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain A dozen years within which space she died And left thee there where thou didst vent thy groans As fast as mill wheels strike Then was this island- Save for the son that she did litter here A freckl'd whelp hag born not honour'd with A human shape Yes Caliban her son Dull thing I say so he that Caliban Whom now I keep in service Thou best know'st What torment I did find thee in thy groans Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts Of ever angry bears it was a torment To lay upon the damn'd which Sycorax Could not again undo It was mine art When I arriv'd and heard thee that made gape The pine and let thee out I thank thee master If thou more murmur'st I will rend an oak And peg thee in his knotty entrails till Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters Pardon master I will be

this music be I ' th ' air or th ' earth It sounds no more and sure it waits upon Some god o ' th ' island Sitting on a bank Weeping again the King my father 's wreck This music crept by me upon the

is no mortal business nor no sound That the earth owes I hear it now above me The fringed curtains of thine eye advance And say what thou seest yond What is't a spirit Lord how it looks about Believe me sir It carries a brave form But ' tis a spirit No wench it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have such This gallant which thou seest Was in the wreck and but he 's something stain'd With grief that 's beauty 's canker thou mightst call him A goodly person He hath lost his fellows And strays about to find 'em I might call him A thing divine for nothing natural I ever saw so noble Aside

comfort My father 's of a better nature sir Than he appears by speech this is unwonted Which now came from him To ARIEL Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds but then exactly do All points of my command To th ' syllable To FERDINAND Come follow To MIRANDA Speak not for him Exeunt Beseech you sir be merry you have cause So have we all of joy for our escape Is much beyond our loss Our hint of woe Is common every day some sailor 's wife The masters of some merchant and the merchant Have just our theme of woe but for the miracle I mean our preservation few in millions Can speak like us Then wisely good sir weigh Our sorrow with our comfort Prithee peace He receives comfort like cold porridge The visitor will not give him o'er so Look he 's winding up the watch of his wit by and by it will strike Sir- One Tell When every grief is entertain'd that 's offer'd Comes to th ' entertainer- A dollar Dolour comes to him indeed you have spoken truer than you purpos'd You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should Therefore my lord- Fie what a spendthrift is he of his tongue I prithee spare Well I have done but yet- He will be talking Which of he or Adrian for a good wager first begins to crow The old cock The cock'rel Done The wager A laughter A match Though this island seem to be desert- Ha ha ha So you 're paid Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible- Yet- Yet- He could not miss't It must needs be of subtle tender and delicate temperance Temperance was a delicate wench Ay and a subtle as he most learnedly deliver'd The air breathes upon us here most sweetly As if it had lungs and rotten ones Or as ' twere perfum'd by a fen Here is everything advantageous to life True save means to live Of that there 's none or little How lush and lusty the grass looks how green The ground indeed is tawny With an eye of green in't He misses not much No he doth but mistake the truth totally But the rarity of it is which is indeed almost beyond credit- As many vouch'd rarities are That our garments being as they were drench'd in the sea hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses being rather new dy'd than stain'd with salt water If but one of his pockets could speak would it not say he lies Ay or very falsely pocket up his report Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in Afric at the marriage of the King 's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis ' Twas a sweet marriage and we prosper well in our return Tunis was never grac'd before with such a paragon to their queen Not since widow Dido 's time Widow a pox o ' that How came that ' widow ' in Widow Dido What if he had said ' widower Aeneas ' too Good Lord how you take it ' Widow Dido ' said you You make me study of that She was of Carthage not of Tunis This Tunis sir was Carthage Carthage I assure you Carthage His word is more than the miraculous harp He hath rais'd the wall and houses too What impossible matter will he make easy next I think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple And sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands Ay Why in good time Sir we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter who is now Queen And the rarest that e'er came there Bate I beseech you widow Dido O widow Dido Ay widow Dido Is not sir my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it I mean in a sort That ' sort ' was well fish'd for When I wore it at your daughter 's marriage You cram these words into mine ears against The stomach of my sense Would I had never Married my daughter there for coming thence My son is lost and in my rate she too Who is so far from Italy removed I ne'er again shall see her O thou mine heir Of Naples and of Milan what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee Sir he may live I saw him beat the surges under him And ride upon their backs he trod the water Whose enmity he flung aside and breasted The surge most swoln that met him his bold head ' Bove the contentious waves he kept and oared Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To th ' shore that o'er his wave worn basis bowed As stooping to relieve him I not doubt He came alive to land No no he 's gone Sir you may thank yourself for this great loss That would not bless our Europe with your daughter But rather lose her to an African Where she at least is banish'd from your eye Who hath cause to wet the grief on't Prithee peace You were kneel'd to and importun'd otherwise By all of us and the fair soul herself Weigh'd between loathness and obedience at Which end o ' th ' beam should bow We have lost your son I fear for ever Milan and Naples have Moe widows in them of this business ' making Than we bring men to comfort them The fault 's your own So is the dear'st o ' th ' loss My lord Sebastian The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness And time to speak it in you rub the sore When you should bring the plaster Very well And most chirurgeonly It is foul weather in us all good sir When you are cloudy Foul weather Very foul Had I plantation of this isle my lord- He 'd sow ' t with nettle seed Or docks or mallows And were the king on't what would I do Scape being drunk for want of wine I ' th ' commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things for no kind of traffic Would I admit no name of magistrate Letters should not be known riches poverty And use of service none contract succession Bourn bound of land tilth vineyard none No use of metal corn or wine or oil No occupation all men idle all And women too but innocent and pure No sovereignty- Yet he would be king on't The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning All things in common nature should produce Without sweat or endeavour Treason felony Sword pike knife gun or need of any engine Would I not have but nature should bring forth Of it own kind all foison all abundance To feed my innocent people No marrying ' mong his subjects None man all idle whores and knaves I would with such perfection govern sir T ' excel the golden age Save his Majesty Long live Gonzalo And do you mark me sir Prithee no more thou dost talk nothing to me I do well believe your Highness and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing ' Twas you we laugh'd at Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still What a blow was there given An it had not fall'n flat long You are gentlemen of brave mettle you would lift the moon out of her sphere if she would continue in it five weeks without changing We would so and then go a bat fowling Nay good my lord be not angry No I warrant you I will not adventure my discretion so weakly Will you laugh me asleep for I am very heavy Go sleep and hear us What all so soon asleep I wish mine eyes Would with themselves shut up my thoughts I find They are inclin'd to do so Please you sir Do not omit the heavy offer of it It seldom visits sorrow when it doth It is a comforter We two my lord Will guard your person while you take your rest And watch your safety Thank you wondrous heavy What a strange drowsiness possesses them It is the quality o ' th ' climate Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink I find not Myself dispos'd to sleep Nor I my spirits are nimble They fell together all as by consent They dropp'd as by a thunder stroke What might Worthy Sebastian O what might No more And yet methinks I see it in thy face What thou shouldst be th ' occasion speaks thee and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head What art thou waking Do you not hear me speak I do and surely It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st Out of thy sleep What is it thou didst say This is a strange repose to be asleep With eyes wide open standing speaking moving And yet so fast asleep Noble Sebastian Thou let'st thy fortune sleep die rather wink'st Whiles thou art waking Thou dost snore distinctly There 's meaning in thy snores I am more serious than my custom you Must be so too if heed me which to do Trebles thee o'er Well I am standing water I 'll teach you how to flow Do so to ebb Hereditary sloth instructs me O If you but knew how you the purpose cherish Whiles thus you mock it how in stripping it You more invest it Ebbing men indeed Most often do so near the bottom run By their own fear or sloth Prithee say on The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim A matter from thee and a birth indeed Which throes thee much to yield Thus sir Although this lord of weak remembrance this Who shall be of as little memory When he is earth'd hath here almost persuaded- For he 's a spirit of persuasion only Professes to persuade the King his son 's alive ' Tis as impossible that he 's undrown'd As he that sleeps here swims I have no hope That he 's undrown'd O out of that ' no hope ' What great hope have you No hope that way is Another way so high a hope that even Ambition can not pierce a wink beyond But doubt discovery there Will you grant with me That Ferdinand is drown'd He 's gone Then tell me Who 's the next heir of Naples Claribel She that is Queen of Tunis she that dwells Ten leagues beyond man 's life she that from Naples Can have no note unless the sun were post The Man i ' th ' Moon 's too slow till newborn chins Be rough and razorable she that from whom We all were sea swallow'd though some cast again And by that destiny to perform an act Whereof what 's past is prologue what to come In yours and my discharge What stuff is this How say you ' Tis true my brother 's daughter 's Queen of Tunis So is she heir of Naples ' twixt which regions There is some space A space whose ev'ry cubit Seems to cry out ' How shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples Keep in Tunis And let Sebastian wake ' Say this were death That now hath seiz'd them why they were no worse Than now they are There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily As this Gonzalo I myself could make A chough of as deep chat O that you bore The mind that I do What a sleep were this For your advancement Do you understand me Methinks I do And how does your content Tender your own good fortune I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero True And look how well my garments sit upon me Much feater than before My brother 's servants Were then my fellows now they are my men But for your conscience- Ay sir where lies that If ' twere a kibe ' Twould put me to my slipper but I feel not This deity in my bosom twenty consciences That stand ' twixt me and Milan candied be they And melt ere they molest Here lies your brother No better than the earth he lies upon If he were that which now he 's like that 's dead Whom I with this obedient steel three inches of it Can lay to bed for ever whiles you doing thus To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel this Sir Prudence who Should not upbraid our course For all the rest They 'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk They 'll tell the clock to any business that We say befits the hour Thy case dear friend Shall be my precedent as thou got'st Milan I 'll come by Naples Draw thy sword One stroke Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest And I the King shall love thee Draw together And when I rear my hand do you the like To fall it on Gonzalo O but one word They talk apart My master through his art foresees the danger That you his friend are in and sends me forth- For else his project dies to keep them living Then let us both be sudden Now good angels Preserve the King They wake Why how now?-Ho awake!-Why are you drawn Wherefore this ghastly looking What 's the matter Whiles we stood here securing your repose Even now we heard a hollow burst of bellowing Like bulls or rather lions did't not wake you It struck mine ear most terribly I heard nothing O ' twas a din to fright a monster 's ear To make an earthquake Sure it was the roar Of a whole herd of lions Heard you this Gonzalo Upon mine honour sir I heard a humming And that a strange one too which did awake me I shak'd you sir and cried as mine eyes open'd I saw their weapons drawn there was a noise That 's verily ' Tis best we stand upon our guard Or that we quit this place Let 's draw our weapons Lead off this ground and let 's make further search For my poor son Heavens keep him from these beasts For he is sure i ' th ' island Lead away Prospero my lord shall know what I have done So King go safely on to seek thy son Exeunt All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs fens flats on Prosper fall and make him By inch meal a disease His spirits hear me And yet I needs must curse But they 'll nor pinch Fright me with urchin shows pitch me i ' th ' mire Nor lead me like a firebrand in the dark Out of my way unless he bid 'em but For every trifle are they set upon me Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me And after bite me then like hedgehogs which Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount Their pricks at my footfall sometime am I All wound with adders who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness Here 's neither bush nor shrub to bear off any weather at all and another storm brewing I hear it sing i ' th ' wind Yond same black cloud yond huge one looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor If it should thunder as it did before I know not where to hide my head Yond same cloud can not choose but fall by pailfuls What have we here a man or a fish dead or alive A fish he smells like a fish a very ancient and fish like smell kind of not of the newest Poor John A strange fish Were I in England now as once I was and had but this fish painted not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver There would this monster make a man any strange beast there makes a man when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian Legg'd like a man and his fins like arms Warm o ' my troth I do now let loose my opinion hold it no longer this is no fish but an islander that hath lately suffered by thunderbolt Thunder Alas the storm is come again My best way is to creep under his gaberdine there is no other shelter hereabout Misery acquaints a man with strange bed fellows I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past I shall no more to sea to sea Here shall I die ashore- This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man 's funeral well here 's my comfort Drinks Do not torment me O What 's the matter Have we devils here Do you put tricks upon 's with savages and men of Ind Ha I have not scap'd drowning to be afeard now of your four legs for it hath been said As proper a man as ever went on four legs can not make him give ground and it shall be said so again while Stephano breathes at nostrils The spirit torments me O This is some monster of the isle with four legs who hath got as I take it an ague Where the devil should he learn our language I will give him some relief if it be but for that If I can recover him and keep him tame and get to Naples with him he 's a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat 's leather Do not torment me prithee I 'll bring my wood home faster He 's in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest He shall taste of my bottle if he have never drunk wine afore it will go near to remove his fit If I can recover him and keep him tame I will not take too much for him he shall pay for him that hath him and that soundly Thou dost me yet but little hurt thou wilt anon I know it by thy trembling now Prosper works upon thee Come on your ways open your mouth here is that which will give language to you cat Open your mouth this will shake your shaking I can tell you and that soundly you can not tell who 's your friend Open your chaps again I should know that voice it should be but he is drown'd and these are devils O defend me Four legs and two voices a most delicate monster His forward voice now is to speak well of his friend his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract If all the wine in my bottle will recover him I will help his ague Come Amen I will pour some in thy other mouth Stephano Doth thy other mouth call me Mercy mercy This is a devil and no monster I will leave him I have no long spoon Stephano If thou beest Stephano touch me and speak to me for I am Trinculo be not afeard thy good friend Trinculo If thou beest Trinculo come forth I 'll pull the by the lesser legs if any be Trinculo 's legs these are they Thou art very Trinculo indeed How cam'st thou to be the siege of this moon calf Can he vent Trinculos I took him to be kill'd with a thunderstroke But art thou not drown'd Stephano I hope now thou are not drown'd Is the storm overblown I hid me under the dead moon calf 's gaberdine for fear of the storm And art thou living Stephano O Stephano two Neapolitans scap'd Prithee do not turn me about my stomach is not constant Aside These be fine things an if they be not sprites That 's a brave god and bears celestial liquor I will kneel to him How didst thou scape How cam'st thou hither Swear by this bottle how thou cam'st hither I escap'd upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved o'erboard- by this bottle which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was cast ashore I 'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject for the liquor is not earthly Here swear then how thou escap'dst Swum ashore man like a duck I can swim like a duck I 'll be sworn Passing the bottle Here kiss the book Though thou canst swim like a duck thou art made like a goose O Stephano hast any more of this The whole butt man my cellar is in a rock by th ' seaside where my wine is hid How now moon calf How does thine ague Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven Out

book I will furnish it anon with new contents Swear By this good light this is a very shallow monster I afeard of him A very weak monster The Man i ' th ' Moon A most poor credulous monster Well drawn monster in good sooth I 'll show thee every fertile inch o ' th ' island and will kiss thy foot I prithee be my god By this light a most perfidious and drunken monster When 's god 's asleep he 'll rob his bottle I 'll kiss thy foot I 'll swear myself thy subject Come on then down and swear I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy- headed monster A most scurvy monster I could find in my heart to beat him- Come kiss But that the poor monster 's in drink An abominable monster I 'll show thee the best springs I 'll pluck thee berries I 'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough A plague upon the tyrant that I serve I 'll bear him no more sticks but follow thee Thou wondrous man A most ridiculous monster to make a wonder of a poor drunkard I prithee let me bring thee where crabs grow And I with my long nails will dig thee pig nuts Show thee a jay 's nest and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset I 'll bring thee To clust'ring filberts and sometimes I 'll get thee Young scamels from the rock Wilt thou go with me I prithee now lead the way without any more talking Trinculo the King and all our company else being drown'd we will inherit here Here bear my bottle Fellow Trinculo

painful and their labour Delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone and most poor matters Point to rich ends This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious but The mistress which I serve quickens what 's dead And makes my labours pleasures O she is Ten times more gentle than her father 's crabbed And he 's compos'd of harshness I must remove Some thousands of these logs and pile them up Upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work and says such baseness Had never like executor I forget But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours Most busy least when I do it Alas now pray you Work not so hard I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile Pray set it down and rest you when this burns ' Twill weep for having wearied you My father Is hard at study pray now rest yourself He 's safe for these three hours O most dear mistress The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do If you 'll sit down I 'll bear your logs the while pray give me that I 'll carry it to the pile No precious creature I had rather crack my sinews break my back Than you should such dishonour

father I have broke your hest to say so Admir'd Miranda What 's dearest to the world Full many a lady I have ey'd with best regard and many a time Th ' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear for several virtues Have I lik'd several women never any With so full soul but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she ow'd And put it to the foil but you

you good friend And my dear father How features are abroad I am skilless of but by my modesty The jewel in my dower I would not wish Any companion in the world but you Nor can imagination form a shape Besides yourself to like of But I prattle Something too wildly and my father 's precepts I therein do forget I am in my condition A prince Miranda I do think a king- I would not so!-and would no more

the green sour ringlets make Whereof the ewe not bites and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew by whose aid- Weak masters though ye be I have be dimm'd The noontide sun call'd forth the mutinous winds And ' twixt the green sea and the azur'd vault Set roaring war To the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire and rifted Jove 's stout oak With his own bolt the strong bas'd promontory Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up The pine and cedar Graves at my command Have wak'd their sleepers op'd and let 'em forth By my so potent art But

where I have lost- How sharp the point of this remembrance is!- My dear son Ferdinand I am woe for't sir Irreparable is the loss and patience Says it is past her cure I rather think You have not sought her help of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid And rest myself content You the like loss As great to me as late and supportable To make the dear loss have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you for I Have lost my daughter A daughter O heavens that they were living both in Naples The King and Queen there That they were I wish Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies When did you lose your daughter In this last tempest I perceive these lords At this encounter do so much admire That they devour their reason and scarce think Their eyes do offices of truth their words Are natural breath but howsoe'er you have Been justled from your senses know for certain That I am Prospero and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan who most strangely Upon this shore where you were wrecked was landed To be the lord on't No more yet of this For ' tis a chronicle of day by day Not a relation for a breakfast nor Befitting this first meeting Welcome sir This cell 's my court here have I few attendants And subjects none abroad pray you look in My dukedom since you have given me again I will requite you with as good a thing At least bring

forth the way Which brought us hither I say Amen Gonzalo Was Milan thrust from Milan that his issue Should become Kings of Naples O rejoice Beyond a common joy and set it down With gold on lasting

will touch the estimate But for that- When we for recompense have prais'd the vile It stains the glory in that happy verse Which aptly sings the good Looking at the jewel ' Tis a good form And rich Here is a water look ye You are rapt sir in some work some dedication To the great lord A thing slipp'd idly from me Our poesy is as a gum which oozes From whence ' tis nourish'd The fire i ' th '

labour on the bosom of this sphere To propagate their states Amongst them all Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd One do I personate of Lord Timon 's frame Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her Whose present grace to present slaves and servants Translates his rivals ' Tis conceiv'd to scope This throne this Fortune and this hill methinks With one man beckon'd from the rest below Bowing his head against the steepy mount To climb his happiness would be well express'd In our condition Nay sir but hear me on All those which were his fellows but of late- Some better than his

When Fortune in her shift and change of mood Spurns down her late beloved all his dependants Which labour'd after him to the mountain 's top Even on their knees and hands let him slip down Not one accompanying his declining foot ' Tis common A thousand moral paintings I can show That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune 's More pregnantly than words Yet you do well To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen The foot above the head Imprison'd is he say you Ay my good lord Five talents is his debt His means most short his creditors most strait Your honourable letter he desires To those have shut him up which failing Periods his comfort Noble Ventidius Well I am not of that feather to shake of My friend when he must need me I do know him A gentleman that well deserves a help Which he shall have I 'll pay the debt and free him Your lordship ever binds him Commend me to him I will send his ransom And being enfranchis'd bid him come to me ' Tis not enough to help the feeble

fair o ' th ' youngest for a bride And I have bred her at my dearest cost In qualities of the best This man of thine Attempts her love I prithee noble lord Join with me to forbid him her resort Myself have spoke in vain The man is honest Therefore he will be Timon His honesty rewards him in itself It must not bear my daughter Does she love him She is young and apt Our own precedent passions do instruct us What levity 's in youth Love you the maid Ay my good lord and she accepts of it If in her marriage my consent be missing I call the gods to witness I will choose Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world And dispossess her all How shall she be endow'd If she be mated with an equal husband Three talents on the present in future all This gentleman of mine hath serv'd me long To build his fortune I will strain a little For ' tis a bond in men Give him thy daughter What you bestow in him I 'll counterpoise And make him weigh with her Most noble lord Pawn me to this your honour

and long live your lordship I thank you you shall hear from me anon Go not away What have you there my friend A piece of painting which I do beseech Your lordship to accept Painting is welcome The painting is almost the natural man For since dishonour traffics with man 's nature He is but outside these pencill'd figures are Even such as they give out I like your work And you shall find I like it wait attendance Till you hear further from me The gods preserve ye Well fare you gentleman Give me your hand We must needs dine together Sir your jewel Hath suffered under praise What my lord Dispraise A mere satiety of commendations If I should pay you for't as ' tis extoll'd It would unclew me quite My lord ' tis rated As those which sell would give but you well know Things of like value differing in the owners Are prized by their masters Believe't dear lord You mend the jewel by the wearing it Well mock'd No my good lord he speaks the common tongue Which all men speak with him Look

mother 's of my generation what 's she if I be a dog Wilt dine with me Apemantus No I eat not lords An thou shouldst thou'dst anger ladies O they eat lords so they come by great bellies That 's a lascivious apprehension So thou apprehend'st it take it for thy labour How dost thou like this jewel Apemantus Not so well as plain dealing which will not cost a man a doit What dost thou think ' tis worth Not worth my thinking How now poet How now philosopher Thou liest Art not one Yes Then I lie not Art not a poet Yes Then thou liest Look in thy last work where thou hast feign'd him a worthy fellow That 's not feign'd- he is so Yes he is worthy of thee and to pay thee for thy labour He that loves to be flattered is worthy o ' th ' flatterer Heavens that I were a lord What wouldst do then

fare thee well Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice Why Apemantus Shouldst have kept one to thyself for I mean to give thee none Hang thyself No I will do nothing at thy bidding make thy requests to thy friend Away unpeaceable dog or I 'll spurn thee hence I will fly like a dog the heels o ' th ' ass Exit He 's opposite to humanity Come shall we in And taste Lord Timon 's bounty He outgoes The very heart of kindness He pours it out Plutus the god of gold Is but his steward no meed but he repays Sevenfold above itself no gift to him But breeds the giver a return exceeding All use of quittance The noblest mind he carries That ever govern'd man Long may he live in fortunes shall we in I 'll keep you company Exeunt Most honoured Timon It hath pleas'd the gods to remember my father 's age And call him to long peace He is gone happy and has left me rich Then as in grateful virtue I am bound To your free heart I do return those talents Doubled with thanks and service from whose help I deriv'd liberty O by no means Honest Ventidius You mistake my love I gave it freely ever and there 's none Can truly say he gives if he receives If our betters play at that game we must not dare To imitate them faults that are rich are fair A noble spirit Nay my lords ceremony was but devis'd at first To set a gloss on faint deeds hollow welcomes Recanting goodness sorry ere ' tis shown

you not O Apemantus you are welcome No You shall not make me welcome I come to have thee thrust me out of doors Fie th'art a churl ye have got a humour there Does not become a man ' tis much to blame They say my lords Ira furor brevis est but yond man is ever angry Go let him have a table by himself for he does neither affect company nor is he fit for't indeed Let me stay at thine apperil Timon I come to observe I give thee warning on't I take no heed of thee Th'art an Athenian therefore welcome I myself would have no power prithee let my meat make thee silent I scorn thy meat ' t'would choke me for I should ne'er flatter thee O you gods what a number of men eats Timon and he sees 'em not It grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man 's blood and all the madness is he cheers them up too I wonder men dare trust themselves with men Methinks they should invite them without knives Good for their meat and safer for their lives There 's much example for't the fellow that sits next him now parts bread with him pledges the breath of him in a divided draught is the readiest man to kill him ' T has been proved If I were a huge man I should fear to drink at meals Lest they should spy my windpipe 's dangerous notes Great men should drink with harness on their throats My lord in heart and let the health go round Let it flow this way my good lord Flow this way A brave fellow He keeps his tides well Those healths will make thee and thy state look ill Timon Here 's that which is too weak to be a sinner honest water which ne'er left man i ' th ' mire This and my food are equals there 's no odds ' Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods Captain Alcibiades your heart 's in the field now My heart is ever at your service my lord You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than dinner of friends So they were bleeding new my lord there 's no meat like 'em I could wish my best friend at such a feast Would all those flatterers were thine enemies then that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em Might we but have that happiness my lord that you would once use our hearts whereby we might express some part of our zeals we should think ourselves for ever perfect O no doubt my good friends but the gods themselves have provided that I shall have much help from you How had you been my friends else Why have you that charitable title from thousands did not you chiefly belong to my heart I have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf and thus far I confirm you O you gods think I what need we have any friends if we should ne'er have need of 'em They were the most needless creatures living should we ne'er have use for 'em and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves Why I have often wish'd myself poorer that I might come nearer to you We are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we call our own than the riches of our friends O what a precious comfort ' tis to have so many like brothers commanding one another 's fortunes O joy 's e'en made away ere't can be born Mine eyes can not hold out water methinks To forget their faults I drink to you Thou weep'st to make them drink Timon Joy had the like conception in our eyes And at that instant like a babe sprung up Ho ho I laugh to think that babe a bastard I promise you my lord you mov'd me much Much Sound tucket What means that trump Please you my lord there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance Ladies What are their wills There comes with them a forerunner my lord

make their welcome Exit CUPID You see my lord how ample y'are belov'd Hoy day what a sweep of vanity comes this way They dance They are mad women Like madness is the glory of this life As this pomp shows to a little oil and root We make ourselves fools to disport ourselves And spend our flatteries to drink those men Upon whose age we void it up again With poisonous spite and envy Who lives that 's not depraved or depraves Who dies that bears not one spurn to their graves Of their friends ' gift I should fear those that dance before me now Would one day stamp upon me ' T has been done Men shut their doors against a setting sun You have done our pleasures much grace fair ladies Set a fair fashion on our entertainment Which was not half so beautiful and kind You have added worth unto't and lustre And entertain'd me with mine own device I am to thank you for't My lord you take us even at the best Faith for the worst is filthy and would not hold taking I doubt me Ladies there is an idle banquet attends you Please you to dispose yourselves Most thankfully my lord Flavius My lord The little casket bring me hither Yes my lord Aside More jewels yet There is no crossing him in 's

honourable gentleman Lord Lucullus entreats your company to morrow to hunt with him and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds I 'll hunt with him and let them be receiv'd Not without fair reward Exit SERVANT Aside What will this come to He commands us to provide and give great gifts And all out of an empty coffer Nor will he know his purse or yield me this To show him what a beggar his heart is Being of no power to make his wishes good His promises fly so beyond his state That what he speaks is all in debt he owes For ev'ry word He is so kind that he now Pays interest for't his land 's put to their books Well would I were gently put out of office Before I were forc'd out Happier is he that has no friend to feed Than such that do e'en enemies exceed I bleed inwardly for my lord Exit You do yourselves much wrong You bate too much of your own merits Here my lord a trifle of our love With more than common thanks I will receive it O he 's the very soul of bounty And now I remember my lord you gave good words the other day of a bay courser I rode on ' Tis yours because you lik'd it O I beseech you pardon me my lord in that You may take my word my lord I know no man Can justly praise but what he does affect I weigh my friend 's affection with mine own I 'll tell you true I 'll call to you O none so welcome I take all and your several visitations So kind to heart '

for 'em Friendship 's full of dregs Methinks false hearts should never have sound legs Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on curtsies Now Apemantus if thou wert not sullen I would be good to thee No I 'll nothing for if I should be brib'd too there would be none left to rail upon thee and then thou wouldst sin the faster Thou giv'st so long Timon I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper

they do shake their heads and I am here No richer in return Is't true Ca n't be They answer in a joint and corporate voice That now they are at fall want treasure can not Do what they would are sorry- you are honourable- But yet they could have wish'd- they know not- Something hath been amiss- a noble nature May catch a wrench- would all were well!- ' tis pity- And so intending other serious

furnish him nothing doubting your present assistance therein La la la la ' Nothing doubting ' says he Alas good lord a noble gentleman ' tis if he would not keep so good a house Many a time and often I ha ' din'd with him and told him on't and come again to supper to him of purpose to have him spend less and yet he would embrace no counsel take no warning by my coming Every man has his fault and honesty is his I ha ' told him on't but I could ne'er get him from't Please your lordship here is the wine Flaminius I have noted thee always wise Here 's to thee Your lordship speaks your pleasure I

honour has my lord 's meat in him Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment When he is turn'd to poison O may diseases only work upon't And when he 's sick to death let not that part of nature Which my lord paid for be of any power To expel sickness but prolong his hour Exit Who the Lord Timon He is my very good friend and an honourable gentleman We know him for no less though we are but strangers to him But I can tell you one thing my lord and which I hear from common rumours now Lord Timon 's happy hours are done and past and his estate shrinks from him Fie no do not believe it he can not want for money But believe you this my lord that not long ago How I tell you denied my lord What a strange case was that Now before the gods I am asham'd on't Denied that honourable man There was very little honour show'd in't For my own part I must needs confess I have received some small kindnesses from him as money plate jewels and such like trifles nothing comparing to his yet had he mistook him and sent to me I should ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents See by good hap yonder 's my lord I have sweat to see his honour.- My honour'd lord Servilius You are kindly met sir Fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord my very exquisite friend May it please your honour my lord hath sent- Ha What has he sent I am so much endeared to that lord he 's ever sending How shall I thank him think'st thou And what has he sent now Has only sent his present occasion now my lord requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents I know his lordship is but merry with me He can not want fifty five hundred talents But in the mean time he wants less my lord If his occasion were not virtuous I should not urge it half so faithfully Dost thou speak seriously Servilius Upon my soul ' tis true sir What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself against such a good time when I might ha ' shown myself honourable How unluckily it happ'ned that I should purchase the day before for a little part and undo a great deal of honour Servilius now before the gods I am not able to do- the more beast I say I was sending to use Lord Timon myself these gentlemen can witness but I would not for the wealth of Athens I had done't now Commend me bountifully to his good lordship and I hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me because I have no power to be kind And tell him this from me I count it one of my greatest afflictions say that I can not pleasure such an honourable gentleman Good Servilius will you befriend me so far as to use mine own words to him Yes sir I shall I 'll look you out a good turn Servilius Do you observe this Hostilius Ay too well Why this is the world 's soul and just of the same Religion groans at it For mine own part I never tasted Timon in my life Nor came any of his bounties over me To mark me for his friend yet I protest For his right noble mind illustrious virtue And honourable carriage Had his necessity made use of me I would have put my wealth into donation And the best half should have return'd to him So much I love his heart But I perceive Men must learn now with pity to dispense For policy sits above conscience Exeunt Must he needs trouble me in't Hum ' Bove all others He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus And now Ventidius is wealthy too Whom he redeem'd from prison All these Owe their estates unto him My lord They have all been touch'd and found base metal for They have all denied him How Have they denied him Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him And does he send to me Three Humh It shows but little love or judgment in him Must I be his last refuge His friends like physicians Thrice give him over Must I take th ' cure upon me Has much disgrac'd me in't I 'm angry at him That might have known my place I see no sense for't But his occasions might have woo'd me first For in my conscience I was the first man That e'er received gift from him And does he think so backwardly of me now That I 'll requite it last No So it may prove an argument of laughter To th ' rest and I ' mongst lords be thought a fool I 'd rather than the worth of thrice the sum Had sent to me first but for my mind 's sake I 'd such a courage to do him good But now return And with their faint reply this answer join Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin Exit Excellent Your lordship 's a goodly villain The devil knew not what he did when he made man politic- he cross'd himself by't and I can not think but in the end the villainies of man will set him clear How fairly this lord strives to appear foul Takes virtuous copies to be wicked like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire Of such a nature is his politic love This was my lord 's best hope now all are fled Save only the gods Now his friends are dead Doors that were ne'er acquainted with their wards Many a bounteous year must be employ'd Now to guard sure their master And this is all a liberal course allows Who can not keep his wealth must keep his house Exit The like to you kind Varro Lucius What do we meet together So is theirs and ours Good day at once Labouring for nine Is not

jewels now of Timon 's gift For which I wait for money It is against my heart I 'm weary of this charge the gods can witness I know my lord hath spent of Timon 's wealth And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth One of Lord Timon 's men No indeed he is not We attend his lordship pray signify so much I need not tell him that he knows you are to diligent Do you hear sir What do ye ask of me my friend We wait for certain money here sir Ay If money were as certain as your waiting ' Twere sure enough Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills When your false masters eat of my lord 's meat Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts And take down th ' int'rest into their glutt'nous maws You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up Let me pass quietly Believe't my lord and I have made an end I have no more to reckon he to spend If ' twill not serve ' tis not so base as you For you serve knaves Exit O here 's Servilius now we shall know some answer If I might beseech you gentlemen to repair some other hour I should derive much from't for take't of my soul my lord leans wondrously to discontent His comfortable temper has forsook him he 's much out of health and keeps his chamber Good gods We can not take this for answer sir Within Servilius help My lord my lord What are my doors oppos'd against my passage Have I been ever free and must my house Be my retentive enemy my gaol The place which I have feasted does it now Like all mankind show me an iron heart My lord here is my bill And mine my lord All our bills Knock me down with 'em cleave me to the girdle

distracted soul There is not so much left to furnish out A moderate table Be it not in thy care Go I charge thee invite them all let in the tide Of knaves once more my cook and I 'll provide Exeunt My lord you have my voice to't the fault 's bloody ' Tis necessary he should die Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy Most true the law shall bruise him Honour health and compassion to the Senate Now Captain I am an humble suitor to your virtues For pity is the virtue of the law And none but tyrants use it cruelly It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy Upon a friend of mine who in hot blood Hath stepp'd into the law which is past depth To those that without heed do plunge into't He is a man setting his fate aside Of comely virtues Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice- An honour in him which buys out his fault- But with a noble fury and fair spirit Seeing his reputation touch'd to death He did oppose his foe And with such sober and unnoted passion He did behove his anger ere ' twas spent As if he had but prov'd an argument You undergo too strict a paradox Striving to make an ugly deed look fair Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd To bring manslaughter into form and set Quarrelling upon the head of valour which indeed Is valour misbegot and came into the world When sects and factions were newly born He 's truly valiant that can wisely suffer The worst that man can breathe And make his wrongs his outsides To wear them like his raiment carelessly And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart To bring it into danger If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill What folly ' tis to hazard life for ill My lord- You can not make gross sins look clear To revenge is no valour but to bear My lords then under favour pardon me If I speak like a captain Why do fond men expose themselves to battle And not endure all threats Sleep upon't And let the foes quietly cut their throats Without repugnancy If there be Such valour in the bearing what make we Abroad Why then women are more valiant That stay at home if bearing carry it And the ass more captain than the lion the fellow Loaden with irons wiser than the judge If wisdom be in suffering O my lords As you are great be pitifully good Who can not condemn rashness in cold blood To kill I grant is sin 's extremest gust But in defence by mercy ' tis most just To be in anger is impiety But who is man that is not angry Weigh but the crime with this You breathe in vain In vain His service done At Lacedaemon and Byzantium Were a sufficient briber for his life What 's that Why I say my lords has done fair service And slain in fight many of your enemies How full of valour did he bear himself In the last conflict and made plenteous wounds He has made too much plenty with 'em He 's a sworn rioter he has a sin that often Drowns him and takes his valour prisoner If there were no foes that were enough To overcome him In that beastly fury He has been known to commit outrages And cherish factions ' Tis inferr'd to us His days are foul and his drink dangerous He dies Hard fate He might have died in war My lords if not for any parts in him- Though his right arm might purchase his own time And be in debt to none- yet more to move you Take my deserts to his and join 'em both And for I know your reverend ages love Security I 'll pawn my victories all My honours to you upon his good returns If by this crime he owes the law his life Why let the war receive't in valiant gore For law is strict and war is nothing more We are for law he dies Urge it no more On height of our displeasure Friend or brother He forfeits his own blood that spills another Must it be so It must not be My lords I do beseech you know me How Call me to your remembrances What I can not think but your age has forgot me It could not else be I should prove so base To sue and be denied such common grace My wounds ache at you Do you dare our anger ' Tis in few words but spacious in effect We banish thee for ever Banish me Banish your dotage Banish usury That makes the Senate ugly If after two days ' shine Athens contain thee Attend our weightier judgment And not to swell our spirit He shall be executed presently Exeunt SENATORS Now the gods keep you old enough that you may live Only in bone that none may look on you I 'm worse than mad I have kept back their foes While they have told their money and let out Their coin upon large interest I myself Rich only in large hurts All those for this Is this the balsam that the usuring Senate Pours into captains ' wounds Banishment It comes not ill I hate not to be banish'd It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury That I may strike at Athens I 'll cheer up My discontented troops and lay for hearts ' Tis honour with most lands to be at odds Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods Exit The good time of day to you sir I also wish it to you I think this honourable lord did but try us this other day Upon that were my thoughts tiring when we encount'red I hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends It should not be by the persuasion of his new feasting I should think so He hath sent me an earnest inviting which many my near occasions did urge me to put off but he hath conjur'd me beyond them and I must needs appear In like manner was I in debt to my importunate business but he would not hear my excuse I am sorry when he sent to borrow of me that my provision was out I am sick of that grief too as I understand how all things go Every man here 's so What would he have borrowed of you A thousand pieces A thousand pieces What of you He sent to me sir- here he comes With all my heart gentlemen both And how fare you Ever at the best hearing well of your lordship The swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship Aside Nor more willingly leaves winter such summer birds are men- Gentlemen our dinner will not recompense this long stay feast your ears with the music awhile if they will fare so harshly o ' th ' trumpet 's sound we shall to't presently I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that I return'd you an empty messenger O sir let it not trouble you My noble lord- Ah my good friend what cheer My most honourable lord I am e'en sick of shame that when your lordship this other day sent to me I was so unfortunate a beggar Think not on't sir If you had sent but two hours before- Let it not cumber your better remembrance The banquet brought in Come bring in all together All cover'd dishes Royal cheer I warrant you Doubt not that if money and the season can yield it How do you What 's the news Alcibiades is banish'd Hear you of it Alcibiades banish'd ' Tis so be sure of it How how I pray you upon what My worthy friends will you draw near I 'll tell you more anon Here 's a noble feast toward This is the old man still Will't hold Will't hold It does but time will- and so- I do conceive Each man to his stool with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike Make not a city feast of it to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place Sit sit The gods require our thanks What does his lordship mean I know not May you a better feast never behold You knot of mouth friends Smoke and lukewarm water Is your perfection This is Timon 's last Who stuck and spangled with your flatteries Washes it off and sprinkles in your faces How now my lords Know you the quality of Lord Timon 's fury Push Did you see my cap I have lost my gown He 's but a mad lord and nought but humours sways him He gave me a jewel th ' other day and now he has beat it out of my hat Did you see my jewel Did you see my cap Here ' tis Here lies my gown Let 's make no stay Lord Timon 's mad I feel't upon my bones One day he gives us diamonds next day stones Let me look back upon thee O thou wall That girdles in those wolves dive in the earth And fence not Athens Matrons turn incontinent Obedience fail in children Slaves and fools Pluck the grave wrinkled Senate from the bench And minister in their steads To general filths Convert o ' th ' instant green virginity Do't in your parents ' eyes Bankrupts hold fast Rather than render back out with your knives And cut your trusters ' throats Bound servants steal Large handed robbers your grave masters are And pill by law Maid to thy master 's bed Thy mistress is o ' th ' brothel Son of sixteen Pluck the lin'd crutch from thy old limping sire With it beat out his brains Piety and fear Religion to the gods peace justice truth Domestic awe night rest and neighbourhood Instruction manners mysteries and trades Degrees observances customs and laws Decline to your confounding contraries And let confusion live Plagues incident to men Your potent and infectious fevers heap On Athens ripe for stroke Thou cold sciatica Cripple our senators that their limbs may halt As lamely as their manners Lust and liberty Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth That ' gainst the stream of virtue they may strive And drown themselves in riot Itches blains Sow all th ' Athenian bosoms and their crop Be general leprosy Breath infect breath That their society as their friendship may Be merely poison Nothing I 'll bear from thee But nakedness thou detestable town Take thou that too with multiplying bans Timon will to the woods where he shall find Th ' unkindest beast more kinder than mankind The gods confound- hear me you good gods all- The Athenians both within and out that wall And grant as Timon grows his hate may grow To the whole race of mankind high and low Amen Exit Hear you Master Steward where 's our master Are we undone cast off nothing remaining Alack my fellows what should I say to you Let me be recorded by the righteous gods I am as poor as you Such a house broke So noble a master fall'n All gone and not One friend to take his fortune by the arm And go along with him As we do turn our backs From our companion thrown into his grave So his familiars to his buried fortunes Slink all away leave their false vows with him Like empty purses pick'd and his poor self A dedicated beggar to the air With his disease of all shunn'd poverty Walks like contempt alone More of our fellows All broken implements of a ruin'd house Yet do our hearts wear Timon 's livery That see I by our faces We are fellows still Serving alike in sorrow Leak'd is our bark And we poor mates stand on the dying deck Hearing the surges threat We must all part Into this sea of air Good fellows all The latest of my wealth I 'll share amongst you Wherever we shall meet for Timon 's sake Let 's yet be fellows let 's shake our heads and say As ' twere a knell unto our master 's fortune ' We have seen better days ' Let each take some O blessed breeding sun draw from the earth Rotten humidity below thy sister 's orb Infect the air Twinn'd brothers of one womb- Whose procreation residence and birth Scarce is dividant- touch them with several fortunes The greater scorns the lesser Not nature To whom all sores lay siege can bear great fortune But by contempt of nature Raise me this beggar and deny't that lord The senator shall bear contempt hereditary The beggar native honour It is the pasture lards the rother 's sides The want that makes him lean Who dares who dares In purity of manhood stand upright And say ' This man 's a flatterer ' If one be So are they all for every grise of fortune Is smooth'd by that below The learned pate Ducks to the golden fool All 's oblique There 's nothing level in our cursed natures But direct villainy Therefore be abhorr'd All feasts societies and throngs of men His semblable yea himself Timon disdains Destruction fang mankind Earth yield me roots What art thou there Speak A beast as thou art The canker gnaw thy heart For showing me again the eyes of man What is thy name Is man so hateful to thee That art thyself a man I am Misanthropos and hate mankind For thy part I do wish thou wert a dog That I might love thee something I know thee well But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange I know thee too and more than that I know thee I not desire to know Follow thy drum With man 's blood paint the ground gules gules Religious canons civil laws are cruel Then what should war be This fell whore of thine Hath in her more destruction than thy sword For all her cherubin look Thy lips rot off I will not kiss thee then the rot returns To thine own lips again How came the noble Timon to this change As the moon does by wanting light to give But then renew I could not like the moon There were no suns to borrow of Noble Timon What friendship may I do thee None but to Maintain my opinion What is it Timon Promise me friendship but perform none If thou wilt not promise the gods plague thee for thou art man If thou dost perform confound thee for thou art a man I have heard in some sort of thy miseries Thou saw'st them when I had prosperity I see them now then was a blessed time As thine is now held with a brace of harlots Is this th ' Athenian minion whom the world Voic'd so regardfully Art thou Timandra Yes Be a whore still they love thee not that use thee Give them diseases leaving with thee their lust Make use of thy salt hours Season the slaves For tubs and baths bring down rose cheek'd youth To the tub fast and the diet Hang thee monster Pardon him sweet Timandra for his wits Are drown'd and lost in his calamities I have but little gold of late brave Timon The want whereof doth daily make revolt In my penurious band I have heard and griev'd How cursed Athens mindless of thy worth Forgetting thy great deeds when neighbour states But for thy sword and fortune trod upon them- I prithee beat thy drum and get thee gone I am thy friend and pity thee dear Timon How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble I had rather be alone Why fare thee well Here is some gold for thee Keep it I can not eat it When I have laid proud Athens on a heap- War'st thou ' gainst Athens Ay Timon and have cause The gods confound them all in thy conquest And thee after when thou hast conquer'd Why me Timon That by killing of villains Thou wast born to conquer my country Put up thy gold Go on Here 's gold Go on Be as a planetary plague when Jove Will o'er some high vic'd city hang his poison In the sick air let not thy sword skip one Pity not honour'd age for his white beard He is an usurer Strike me the counterfeit matron It is her habit only that is honest Herself 's a bawd Let not the virgin 's cheek Make soft thy trenchant sword for those milk paps That through the window bars bore at men 's eyes Are not within the leaf of pity writ But set them down horrible traitors Spare not the babe Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy Think it a bastard whom the oracle Hath doubtfully pronounc'd thy throat shall cut And mince it sans remorse Swear against abjects Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes Whose proof nor yells of mothers maids nor babes Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding Shall pierce a jot There 's gold to pay thy soldiers Make large confusion and thy fury spent Confounded be thyself Speak not be gone Hast thou gold yet I 'll take the gold thou givest me Not all thy counsel Dost thou or dost thou not heaven 's curse upon thee Give us some gold good Timon Hast thou more Enough to make a whore forswear her trade And to make whores a bawd Hold up you sluts Your aprons mountant you are not oathable Although I know you 'll swear terribly swear Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues Th ' immortal gods that hear you Spare your oaths I 'll trust to your conditions Be whores still And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you- Be strong in whore allure him burn him up Let your close fire predominate his smoke And be no turncoats Yet may your pains six months Be quite contrary And thatch your poor thin roofs With burdens of the dead- some that were hang'd No matter Wear them betray with them Whore still Paint till a horse may mire upon your face A pox of wrinkles Well more gold What then Believe't that we 'll do anything for gold Consumptions sow In hollow bones of man strike their sharp shins And mar men 's spurring Crack the lawyer 's voice That he may never more false title plead Nor sound his quillets shrilly Hoar the flamen That scolds against the quality of flesh And not believes himself Down with the nose Down with it flat take the bridge quite away Of him that his particular to foresee Smells from the general weal Make curl'd pate ruffians bald And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war Derive some pain from you Plague all That your activity may defeat and quell The source of all erection There 's more gold Do you damn others and let this damn you And ditches grave you all More counsel with more money bounteous Timon More whore more mischief first I have given you earnest Strike up the drum towards Athens Farewell Timon If I thrive well I 'll visit thee again If I hope well I 'll never see thee more I never did thee harm Yes thou spok'st well of me Call'st thou that harm Men daily find it Get thee away and take Thy beagles with thee We but offend him Strike That nature being sick of man 's unkindness Should yet be hungry Common mother thou Digging Whose womb unmeasurable and infinite breast Teems and feeds all whose self same mettle Whereof thy proud child arrogant man is puff'd Engenders the black toad and adder blue The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm With all th ' abhorred births below crisp heaven Whereon Hyperion 's quick'ning fire doth shine- Yield him who all thy human sons doth hate From forth thy plenteous bosom one poor root Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb Let it no more bring out ingrateful man Go great with tigers dragons wolves and bears Teem with new monsters whom thy upward face Hath to the marbled mansion all above Never presented!- O a root Dear thanks!- Dry up thy marrows vines and plough torn leas Whereof ingrateful man with liquorish draughts And morsels unctuous greases his pure mind That from it all consideration slips- I was directed hither Men report Thou dost affect my manners and dost use them ' Tis then because thou dost not keep a dog Whom I would imitate Consumption catch thee This is in thee a nature but infected A poor unmanly melancholy sprung From change of fortune Why this spade this place This slave like habit and these looks of care Thy flatterers yet wear silk drink wine lie soft Hug their diseas'd perfumes and have forgot That ever Timon was Shame not these woods By putting on the cunning of a carper Be thou a flatterer now and seek to thrive By that which has undone thee hinge thy knee And let his very breath whom thou'lt observe Blow off thy cap praise his most vicious strain And call it excellent Thou wast told thus Thou gav'st thine ears like tapsters that bade welcome To knaves and all approachers ' Tis most just That thou turn rascal hadst thou wealth again Rascals should have't Do not assume my likeness Were I like thee I 'd throw away myself Thou hast cast away thyself being like thyself A madman so long now a fool What think'st That the bleak air thy boisterous chamberlain Will put thy shirt on warm Will these moist trees That have outliv'd the eagle page thy heels And skip when thou point'st out Will the cold brook Candied with ice caudle thy morning taste To cure thy o'ernight 's surfeit Call the creatures Whose naked natures live in all the spite Of wreakful heaven whose bare unhoused trunks To the conflicting elements expos'd Answer mere nature- bid them flatter thee O thou shalt find- A fool of thee Depart I love thee better now than e'er I did I hate thee worse Why Thou flatter'st misery I flatter not but say thou art a caitiff Why dost thou seek me out To vex thee Always a villain 's office or a fool 's Dost please thyself in't Ay What a knave too If thou didst put this sour cold habit on To castigate thy pride ' twere well but thou Dost it enforcedly Thou'dst courtier be again Wert thou not beggar Willing misery Outlives incertain pomp is crown'd before The one is filling still never complete The other at high wish Best state contentless Hath a distracted and most wretched being Worse than the worst content Thou should'st desire to die being miserable Not by his breath that is more miserable Thou art a slave whom Fortune 's tender arm With favour never clasp'd but bred a dog Hadst thou like us from our first swath proceeded The sweet degrees that this brief world affords To such as may the passive drugs of it Freely command thou wouldst have plung'd thyself In general riot melted down thy youth In different beds of lust and never learn'd The icy precepts of respect but followed The sug'red game before thee But myself Who had the world as my confectionary The mouths the tongues the eyes and hearts of men At duty more than I could frame employment That numberless upon me stuck as leaves Do on the oak have with one winter 's brush Fell from their boughs and left me open bare For every storm that blows- I to bear this That never knew but better is some burden Thy nature did commence in sufferance time Hath made thee hard in't Why shouldst thou hate men They never flatter'd thee What hast thou given If thou wilt curse thy father that poor rag Must be thy subject who in spite put stuff To some she beggar and compounded thee Poor rogue hereditary Hence be gone If thou hadst not been born the worst of men Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer Art thou proud yet Ay that I am not thee I that I was No prodigal I that I am one now Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee I 'd give thee leave to hang it Get thee gone That the whole life of Athens were in this Thus would I eat it Eating a root Here I will mend thy feast First mend my company take away thyself So I shall mend mine own by th ' lack of thine ' Tis not well mended so it is but botch'd If not I would it were What wouldst thou have to Athens Thee thither in a whirlwind If thou wilt Tell them there I have gold look so I have Here is no use for gold The best and truest For here it sleeps and does no hired harm Where liest a nights Timon Under that 's above me Where feed'st thou a days Apemantus Where my stomach finds meat or rather where I eat it Would poison were obedient and knew my mind Where wouldst thou send it To sauce thy dishes The middle of humanity thou never knewest but the extremity of both ends When thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume they mock'd thee for too much curiosity in thy rags thou know'st none but art despis'd for the contrary There 's a medlar for thee eat it On what I hate I feed not Dost hate a medlar Ay though it look like thee An th ' hadst hated medlars sooner thou shouldst have loved thyself better now What man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means Who without those means thou talk'st of didst thou ever know belov'd Myself I understand thee thou hadst some means to keep a dog What things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers Women nearest but men men are the things themselves What wouldst thou do with the world Apemantus if it lay in thy power Give it the beasts to be rid of the men Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men and remain a beast with the beasts Ay Timon A beastly ambition which the gods grant thee t ' attain to If thou wert the lion the fox would beguile thee if thou wert the lamb the fox would eat thee if thou wert the fox the lion would suspect thee when peradventure thou wert accus'd by the ass If thou wert the ass thy dulness would torment thee and still thou liv'dst but as a breakfast to the wolf If thou wert the wolf thy greediness would afflict thee and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner Wert thou the unicorn pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury Wert thou bear thou wouldst be kill'd by the horse wert thou a horse thou wouldst be seiz'd by the leopard wert thou a leopard thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life All thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence What beast couldst thou be that were not subject to a beast And what beast art thou already that seest not thy loss in transformation If thou couldst please me with speaking to me thou mightst have hit upon it here The commonwealth of Athens is become a forest of beasts How has the ass broke the wall that thou art out of the city Yonder comes a poet and a painter The plague of company light upon thee I will fear to catch it and give way When I know not what else to do I 'll see thee again When there is nothing living but thee thou shalt be welcome I had rather be a beggar 's dog than Apemantus Thou art the cap of all the fools alive Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon A plague on thee thou art too bad to curse All villains that do stand by thee are pure There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st If I name thee I 'll beat thee- but I should infect my hands I would my tongue could rot them off Away thou issue of a mangy dog Choler does kill me that thou art alive I swoon to see thee Would thou wouldst burst Away Thou tedious rogue I am sorry I shall lose A stone by thee Throws a stone at him Beast Slave Toad Rogue rogue rogue I am sick of this false world and will love nought But even the mere necessities upon't Then Timon presently prepare thy grave Lie where the light foam of the sea may beat Thy gravestone daily make thine epitaph That death in me at others ' lives may laugh Looks at the gold O thou sweet king killer and dear divorce ' Twixt natural son and sire thou bright defiler Of Hymen 's purest bed thou valiant Mars Thou ever young fresh lov'd and delicate wooer Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow That lies on Dian 's lap thou visible god That sold'rest close impossibilities And mak'st them kiss that speak'st with every tongue To every purpose O thou touch of hearts Think thy slave man rebels and by thy virtue Set them into confounding odds that beasts May have the world in empire Would ' twere so But not till I am dead I 'll say th ' hast gold Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly Throng'd to Ay Thy back I prithee Live and love thy misery Long live so and so die Exit APEMANTUS I am quit More things like men Eat Timon and abhor them Where should he have this gold It is some poor fragment some slender ort of his remainder The mere want of gold and the falling from of his friends drove him into this melancholy It is nois'd he hath a mass of treasure Let us make the assay upon him if he care not for't he will supply us easily if he covetously reserve it how shall 's get it True for he bears it not about him ' Tis hid Is not this he Where ' Tis his description He I know him Save thee Timon Now thieves Soldiers not thieves Both too and women 's sons We are not thieves but men that much do want Your greatest want is you want much of meat Why should you want Behold the earth hath roots Within this mile break forth a hundred springs The oaks bear mast the briars scarlet hips The bounteous housewife Nature on each bush Lays her full mess before you Want Why want We can not live on grass on berries water As beasts and birds and fishes Nor on the beasts themselves the birds and fishes You must eat men Yet thanks I must you con That you are thieves profess'd that you work not In holier shapes for there is boundless theft In limited professions Rascal thieves Here 's gold Go suck the subtle blood o ' th ' grape Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth And so scape hanging Trust not the physician His antidotes are poison and he slays Moe than you rob Take wealth and lives together Do villainy do since you protest to do't Like workmen I 'll example you with thievery The sun 's a thief and with his great attraction Robs the vast sea the moon 's an arrant thief And her pale fire she snatches from the sun The sea 's a thief whose liquid surge resolves The moon into salt tears the earth 's a thief That feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n From gen'ral excrement- each thing 's a thief The laws your curb and whip in their rough power Has uncheck'd theft Love not yourselves away Rob one another There 's more gold Cut throats All that you meet are thieves To Athens go Break open shops nothing can you steal But thieves do lose it Steal not less for this I give you and gold confound you howsoe'er Amen Has almost charm'd me from my profession by persuading me to it ' Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us not to have us thrive in our mystery I 'll believe him as an enemy and give over my trade Let us first see peace in Athens There is no time so miserable but a man may be true Exeunt THIEVES O you gods Is yond despis'd and ruinous man my lord Full of decay and failing O monument And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd What an alteration of honour Has desp'rate want made What viler thing upon the earth than friends Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends How rarely does it meet with this time 's guise When man was wish'd to love his enemies Grant I may ever love and rather woo Those that would mischief me than those that do Has caught me in his eye I will present My honest grief unto him and as my lord Still serve him with my life My dearest master Away What art thou Have you forgot me sir Why dost ask that I have forgot all men Then if thou grant'st th'art a man I have forgot thee An honest poor servant of yours Then I know thee not I never had honest man about me I. All I kept were knaves to serve in meat to villains The gods are witness Nev'r did poor steward wear a truer grief For his undone lord than mine eyes for you What dost thou weep Come nearer Then I love thee Because thou art a woman and disclaim'st Flinty mankind whose eyes do never give But thorough lust and laughter Pity 's sleeping Strange times that weep with laughing not with weeping I beg of you to know me good my lord T ' accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts To entertain me as your steward still Had I a steward So true so just and now so comfortable It almost turns my dangerous nature mild Let me behold thy face Surely this man Was born of woman Forgive my general and exceptless rashness You perpetual sober gods I do proclaim One honest man- mistake me not but one No more I pray- and he 's a steward How fain would I have hated all mankind And thou redeem'st thyself But all save thee I fell with curses Methinks thou art more honest now than wise For by oppressing and betraying me Thou mightst have sooner got another service For many so arrive at second masters Upon their first lord 's neck But tell me true For I must ever doubt though ne'er so sure Is not thy kindness subtle covetous If not a usuring kindness and as rich men deal gifts Expecting in return twenty for one No my most worthy master in whose breast Doubt and suspect alas are plac'd too late You should have fear'd false times when you did feast Suspect still comes where an estate is least That which I show heaven knows is merely love Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind Care of your food and living and believe it My most honour'd lord For any benefit that points to me Either in hope or present I 'd exchange For this one wish that you had power and wealth To requite me by making rich yourself Look thee ' tis so Thou singly honest man Here take The gods out of my misery Have sent thee treasure Go live rich and happy But thus condition'd thou shalt build from men Hate all curse all show charity to none But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone Ere thou relieve the beggar Give to dogs What thou deniest to men let prisons swallow 'em Debts wither 'em to nothing Be men like blasted woods And may diseases lick up their false bloods And so farewell and thrive O let me stay And comfort you my master If thou hat'st curses Stay not fly whilst thou art blest and free Ne'er see thou man and let me ne'er see thee As I took note of the place it can not be far where he abides to be thought of him Does the rumour hold for true that he 's so full of gold Certain Alcibiades reports it Phrynia and Timandra had gold of him He likewise enrich'd poor straggling soldiers with great quantity ' Tis said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends Nothing else You shall see him a palm in Athens again and flourish with the highest Therefore ' tis not amiss we tender our loves to him in this suppos'd distress of his it will show honestly in us and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for if it be just and true report that goes of his having What have you now to present unto him Nothing at this time but my visitation only I will promise him an excellent piece I must serve him so too tell him of an intent that 's coming toward him Good as the best Promising is the very air o ' th ' time it opens the eyes of expectation Performance is ever the duller for his act and but in the plainer and simpler kind of people the deed of saying is quite out of use To promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it Aside Excellent workman Thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for him It must be a personating of himself a satire against the softness of prosperity with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency Aside Must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work Wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men Do so I have gold for thee Nay let 's seek him Then do we sin against our own estate When we may profit meet and come too late True When the day serves before black corner'd night Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light Come Aside I 'll meet you at the turn What a god 's gold That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple Than where swine feed ' Tis thou that rig'st the bark and plough'st the foam Settlest admired reverence in a slave To thee be worship and thy saints for aye Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey Fit I meet them Advancing from his cave Hail worthy Timon Our late noble master Have I once liv'd to see two honest men Sir Having often of your open bounty tasted Hearing you were retir'd your friends fall'n off Whose thankless natures- O abhorred spirits!- Not all the whips of heaven are large enough- What to you Whose star like nobleness gave life and influence To their whole being I am rapt and can not cover The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude With any size of words Let it go naked men may see't the better You that are honest by being what you are Make them best seen and known He and myself Have travail'd in the great show'r of your gifts And sweetly felt it Ay you are honest men We are hither come to offer you our service Most honest men Why how shall I requite you Can you eat roots and drink cold water- No What we can do we 'll do to do you service Y'are honest men Y'have heard that I have gold I am sure you have Speak truth y'are honest men So it is said my noble lord but therefore Came not my friend nor I. Good honest men Thou draw'st a counterfeit Best in all Athens Th'art indeed the best Thou counterfeit'st most lively So so my lord E'en so sir as I say To To POET And for thy fiction Why thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth That thou art even natural in thine art But for all this my honest natur'd friends I must needs say you have a little fault Marry ' tis not monstrous in you neither wish I You take much pains to mend Beseech your honour To make it known to us You 'll take it ill Most thankfully my lord Will you indeed Doubt it not worthy lord There 's never a one of you but trusts a knave That mightily deceives you Do we my lord Ay and you hear him cog see him dissemble Know his gross patchery love him feed him Keep in your bosom yet remain assur'd That he 's a made up villain I know not such my lord Nor I. Look you I love you well I 'll give you gold Rid me these villains from your companies Hang them or stab them drown them in a draught Confound them by some course and come to me I 'll give you gold enough Name them my lord let 's know them You that way and you this- but two in company Each man apart all single and alone Yet an arch villain keeps him company To the PAINTER If where thou art two villians shall not be Come not near him To the POET If thou wouldst not reside But where one villain is then him abandon.- Hence pack there 's gold you came for gold ye slaves To the PAINTER You have work for me there 's payment hence To the POET You are an alchemist make gold of that.- Out rascal dogs Beats and drives them out It is vain that you would speak with Timon For he is set so only to himself That nothing but himself which looks like man Is friendly with him Bring us to his cave It is our part and promise to th ' Athenians To speak with Timon At all times alike Men are not still the same ' twas time and griefs That fram'd him thus Time with his fairer hand Offering the fortunes of his former days The former man may make him Bring us to him And chance it as it may Here is his cave Peace and content be here Lord Timon Timon Look out and speak to friends Th ' Athenians By two of their most reverend Senate greet thee Speak to them noble Timon Thou sun that comforts burn Speak and be hang'd For each true word a blister and each false Be as a cauterizing to the root o ' th ' tongue Consuming it with speaking Worthy Timon- Of none but such as you and you of Timon The senators of Athens greet thee Timon I thank them and would send them back the plague Could I but catch it for them O forget What we are sorry for ourselves in thee The senators with one consent of love Entreat thee back to Athens who have thought On special dignities which vacant lie For thy best use and wearing They confess Toward thee forgetfulness too general gross Which now the public body which doth seldom Play the recanter feeling in itself A lack of Timon 's aid hath sense withal Of it own fail restraining aid to Timon And send forth us to make their sorrowed render Together with a recompense more fruitful Than their offence can weigh down by the dram Ay even such heaps and sums of love and wealth As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs And write in thee the figures of their love Ever to read them thine You witch me in it Surprise me to the very brink of tears Lend me a fool 's heart and a woman 's eyes And I 'll beweep these comforts worthy senators Therefore so please thee to return with us And of our Athens thine and ours to take The captainship thou shalt be met with thanks Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name Live with authority So soon we shall drive back Of Alcibiades th ' approaches wild Who like a boar too savage doth root up His country 's peace And shakes his threat'ning sword Against the walls of Athens Therefore Timon- Well sir I will Therefore I will sir thus If Alcibiades kill my countrymen Let Alcibiades know this of Timon That Timon cares not But if he sack fair Athens And take our goodly aged men by th ' beards Giving our holy virgins to the stain Of contumelious beastly mad brain'd war Then let him know- and tell him Timon speaks it In pity of our aged and our youth- I can not choose but tell him that I care not And let him take't at worst for their knives care not While you have throats to answer For myself There 's not a whittle in th ' unruly camp But I do prize it at my love before The reverend'st throat in Athens So I leave you To the protection of the prosperous gods As thieves to keepers Stay not all 's in vain Why I was writing of my epitaph It will be seen to morrow My long sickness Of health and living now begins to mend And nothing brings me all things Go live still Be Alcibiades your plague you his And last so long enough We speak in vain But yet I love my country and am not One that rejoices in the common wreck As common bruit doth put it That 's well spoke Commend me to my loving countrymen- These words become your lips as they pass through them And enter in our ears like great triumphers In their applauding gates Commend me to them And tell them that to ease them of their griefs Their fears of hostile strokes their aches losses Their pangs of love with other incident throes That nature 's fragile vessel doth sustain In life 's uncertain voyage I will some kindness do them- I 'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades ' wrath I like this well he will return again I have a tree which grows here in my close That mine own use invites me to cut down And shortly must I fell it Tell my friends Tell Athens in the sequence of degree From high to low throughout that whoso please To stop affliction let him take his haste Come hither ere my tree hath felt the axe And hang himself I pray you do my greeting Trouble him no further thus you still shall find him Come not to me again but say to Athens Timon hath made his everlasting mansion Upon the beached verge of the salt flood Who once a day with his embossed froth The turbulent surge shall cover Thither come And let my gravestone be your oracle Lips let sour words go by and language end What is amiss plague and infection mend Graves only be men 's works and death their gain Sun hide thy beams Timon hath done his reign His discontents are unremovably Coupled to nature Our hope in him is dead Let us return And strain what other means is left unto us In our dear peril It requires swift foot Exeunt Thou hast painfully discover'd are his files As full as thy report I have spoke the least Besides his expedition promises Present approach We stand much hazard if they bring not Timon I met a courier one mine ancient friend Whom though in general part we were oppos'd Yet our old love had a particular force And made us speak like friends This man was riding From Alcibiades to Timon 's cave With letters of entreaty which imported His fellowship i ' th ' cause against your city In part for his sake mov'd Here come our brothers No talk of Timon nothing of him expect The enemies ' drum is heard and fearful scouring Doth choke the air with dust In and prepare Ours is the fall I fear our foes the snare Exeunt By all description this should be the place Who 's here Speak ho No answer What is this Timon is dead who hath outstretch'd his span Some beast rear'd this here does not live a man Dead sure and this his grave What 's on this tomb I can not read the character I 'll take with wax Our captain hath in every figure skill An ag'd interpreter though young in days Before proud Athens he 's set down by this Whose fall the mark of his ambition is Exit Sound to this coward and lascivious town Our terrible approach Noble and young When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear We sent to thee to give thy rages balm To wipe out our ingratitude with loves Above their quantity So did we woo Transformed Timon to our city 's love By humble message and by promis'd means We were not all unkind nor all deserve The common stroke of war These walls of ours Were not erected by their hands from whom You have receiv'd your griefs nor are they such That these great tow'rs trophies and schools should fall For private faults in them Nor are they living Who were the motives that you first went out Shame that they wanted cunning in excess Hath broke their hearts March noble lord Into our city with thy banners spread By decimation and a tithed death- If thy revenges hunger for that food Which nature loathes- take thou the destin'd tenth And by the hazard of the spotted die Let die the spotted All have not offended For those that were it is not square to take On those that are revenge crimes like lands Are not inherited Then dear countryman Bring in thy ranks but leave without thy rage Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall With those that have offended Like a shepherd Approach the fold and cull th ' infected forth But kill not all together What thou wilt Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile Than hew to't with thy sword Set but thy foot Against our rampir'd gates and they shall ope So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before To say thou't enter friendly Throw thy glove Or any token of thine honour else That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress And not as our confusion all thy powers Shall make their harbour in our town till we Have seal'd thy full desire Then there 's my glove Descend and open your uncharged ports Those enemies of Timon 's and mine own Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof Fall and no more And to atone your fears With my more noble meaning not a man Shall pass his quarter or offend the stream Of regular justice in your city 's bounds But shall be render'd to your public laws At heaviest answer ' Tis most nobly spoken Descend and keep your words My noble General Timon is dead Entomb'd upon the very hem o ' th ' sea And on his grave stone this insculpture which With wax I brought away whose soft impression Interprets for my poor ignorance Noble patricians patrons of my right Defend the justice of my cause with arms And countrymen my loving followers Plead my successive title with your swords I am his first born son that was the last That ware the imperial diadem of Rome Then let my father 's honours live in me Nor wrong mine age with this indignity Romans friends followers favourers of my right If ever Bassianus Caesar 's son Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome Keep then this passage to the Capitol And suffer not dishonour to approach The imperial seat to virtue consecrate To justice continence and nobility But let desert in pure election shine And Romans fight for freedom in your choice Princes that strive by factions and by friends Ambitiously for rule and empery Know that the people of Rome for whom we stand A special party have by common voice In election for the Roman empery Chosen Andronicus surnamed Pius For many good and great deserts to Rome A nobler man a braver warrior Lives not this day within the city walls He by the Senate is accited home From weary wars against the barbarous Goths That with his sons a terror to our foes Hath yok'd a nation strong train'd up in arms Ten years are spent since first he undertook This cause of Rome and chastised with arms Our enemies ' pride five times he hath return'd Bleeding to Rome bearing his valiant sons In coffins from the field and at this day To the monument of that Andronici Done sacrifice of expiation And slain the noblest prisoner of the Goths And now at last laden with honour 's spoils Returns the good Andronicus to Rome Renowned Titus flourishing in arms Let us entreat by honour of his name Whom worthily you would have now succeed And in the Capitol and Senate 's right Whom you pretend to honour and adore That you withdraw you and abate your strength Dismiss your followers and as suitors should Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness How fair the Tribune speaks to calm my thoughts Marcus Andronicus so I do affy In thy uprightness and integrity And so I love and honour thee and thine Thy noble brother Titus and his sons And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all Gracious Lavinia Rome 's rich ornament That I will here dismiss my loving friends And to my fortunes and the people 's favour Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd Friends that have been thus forward in my right I thank you all and here dismiss you all And to the love and favour of my country Commit myself my person and the cause Tribunes and me a poor competitor Romans make way The good Andronicus Patron of virtue Rome 's best champion Successful in the battles that he fights With honour and with fortune is return'd From where he circumscribed with his sword And brought to yoke the enemies of Rome Hail Rome victorious in thy mourning weeds Lo as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught Returns with precious lading to the bay From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage Cometh Andronicus bound with laurel boughs To re salute his country with his tears Tears of true joy for his return to Rome Thou great defender of this Capitol Stand gracious to the rites that we intend Romans of five and twenty valiant sons Half of the number that King Priam had Behold the poor remains alive and dead These that survive let Rome reward with love These that I bring unto their latest home With burial amongst their ancestors Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword Titus unkind and careless of thine own Why suffer'st thou thy sons unburied yet To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx Make way to lay them by their brethren Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths That we may hew his limbs and on a pile Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh Before this earthy prison of their bones That so the shadows be not unappeas'd Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth I give him you- the noblest that survives The eldest son of this distressed queen Stay Roman brethen Gracious conqueror Victorious Titus rue the tears I shed A mother 's tears in passion for her son And if thy sons were ever dear to thee O think my son to be as dear to me Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome To beautify thy triumphs and return Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke But must my sons be slaughtered in the streets For valiant doings in their country 's cause O if to fight for king and commonweal Were piety in thine it is in these Andronicus stain not thy tomb with blood Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods Draw near them then in being merciful Sweet mercy is nobility 's true badge Thrice noble Titus spare my first born son Patient yourself madam and pardon me These are their brethren whom your Goths beheld Alive and dead and for their brethren slain Religiously they ask a sacrifice To this your son is mark'd and die he must T ' appease their groaning shadows that are gone Away with him and make a fire straight And with our swords upon a pile of wood Let 's hew his limbs till they be clean consum'd O cruel irreligious piety Was never Scythia half so barbarous Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome Alarbus goes to rest and we survive To tremble under Titus ' threat'ning look Then madam stand resolv'd but hope withal The self same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy With opportunity of sharp revenge Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent May favour Tamora the Queen of Goths- When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen- To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes See lord and father how we have perform'd Our Roman rites Alarbus ' limbs are lopp'd And entrails feed the sacrificing fire Whose smoke like incense doth perfume the sky Remaineth nought but to inter our brethren And with loud ' larums welcome them to Rome Let it be so and let Andronicus Make this his latest farewell to their souls In peace and honour live Lord Titus long My noble lord and father live in fame Lo at this tomb my tributary tears I render for my brethren 's obsequies And at thy feet I kneel with tears of joy Shed on this earth for thy return to Rome O bless me here with thy victorious hand Whose fortunes Rome 's best citizens applaud Kind Rome that hast thus lovingly reserv'd The cordial of mine age to glad my heart Lavinia live outlive thy father 's days And fame 's eternal date for virtue 's praise Long live Lord Titus my beloved brother Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome Thanks gentle Tribune noble brother Marcus And welcome nephews from successful wars You that survive and you that sleep in fame Fair lords your fortunes are alike in all That in your country 's service drew your swords But safer triumph is this funeral pomp That hath aspir'd to Solon 's happiness And triumphs over chance in honour 's bed Titus Andronicus the people of Rome Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been Send thee by me their Tribune and their trust This par]iament of white and spotless hue And name thee in election for the empire With these our late deceased Emperor 's sons Be candidatus then and put it on And help to set a head on headless Rome A better head her glorious body fits Than his that shakes for age and feebleness What should I don this robe and trouble you Be chosen with proclamations to day To morrow yield up rule resign my life And set abroad new business for you all Rome I have been thy soldier forty years And led my country 's strength successfully And buried one and twenty valiant sons Knighted in field slain manfully in arms In right and service of their noble country Give me a staff of honour for mine age But not a sceptre to control the world Upright he held it lords that held it last Titus thou shalt obtain and ask the empery Proud and ambitious Tribune canst thou tell Patience Prince Saturninus Romans do me right Patricians draw your swords and sheathe them not Till Saturninus be Rome 's Emperor Andronicus would thou were shipp'd to hell Rather than rob me of the people 's hearts Proud Saturnine interrupter of the good That noble minded Titus means to thee Content thee Prince I will restore to thee The people 's hearts and wean them from themselves Andronicus I do not flatter thee But honour thee and will do till I die My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends I will most thankful be and thanks to men Of noble minds is honourable meed People of Rome and people 's Tribunes here I ask your voices and your suffrages Will ye bestow them friendly on Andronicus To gratify the good Andronicus And gratulate his safe return to Rome The people will accept whom he admits Tribunes I thank you and this suit I make That you create our Emperor 's eldest son Lord Saturnine whose virtues will I hope Reflect on Rome as Titan 's rays on earth And ripen justice in this commonweal Then if you will elect by my advice Crown him and say ' Long live our Emperor ' With voices and applause of every sort Patricians and plebeians we create Lord Saturninus Rome 's great Emperor And say ' Long live our Emperor Saturnine ' Titus Andronicus for thy favours done To us in our election this day I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts And will with deeds requite thy gentleness And for an onset Titus to advance Thy name and honourable family Lavinia will I make my emperess Rome 's royal mistress mistress of my heart And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse Tell me Andronicus doth this motion please thee It doth my worthy lord and in this match I hold me highly honoured of your Grace And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine King and commander of our commonweal The wide world 's Emperor do I consecrate My sword my chariot and my prisoners Presents well worthy Rome 's imperious lord Receive them then the tribute that I owe Mine honour 's ensigns humbled at thy feet Thanks noble Titus father of my life How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts Rome shall record and when I do forget The least of these unspeakable deserts Romans forget your fealty to me To TAMORA Now madam are you prisoner to an emperor To him that for your honour and your state Will use you nobly and your followers Aside A goodly lady trust me of the hue That I would choose were I to choose anew.- Clear up fair Queen that cloudy countenance Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer Thou com'st not to be made a scorn in Rome- Princely shall be thy usage every way Rest on my word and let not discontent Daunt all your hopes Madam he comforts you Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths Lavinia you are not displeas'd with this Not I my lord sith true nobility Warrants these words in princely courtesy Thanks sweet Lavinia Romans let us go Ransomless here we set our prisoners free Proclaim our honours lords with trump and drum Lord Titus by your leave this maid is mine How sir Are you in earnest then my lord Ay noble Titus and resolv'd withal To do myself this reason and this right Suum cuique is our Roman justice This prince in justice seizeth but his own And that he will and shall if Lucius live Traitors avaunt Where is the Emperor 's guard Treason my lord- Lavinia is surpris'd Surpris'd By whom By him that justly may Bear his betroth'd from all the world away Brothers help to convey her hence away And with my sword I 'll keep this door safe Follow my lord and I 'll soon bring her back My lord you pass not here What villain boy Bar'st me my way in Rome Help Lucius help My lord you are unjust and more than so In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son Nor thou nor he are any sons of mine My sons would never so dishonour me Dead if you will but not to be his wife That is another 's lawful promis'd love Exit No Titus no the Emperor needs her not Nor her nor thee nor any of thy stock I 'll trust by leisure him that mocks me once Thee never nor thy traitorous haughty sons Confederates all thus to dishonour me Was there none else in Rome to make a stale But Saturnine Full well Andronicus Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine That saidst I begg'd the empire at thy hands O monstrous What reproachful words are these But go thy ways go give that changing piece To him that flourish'd for her with his sword A valiant son in law thou shalt enjoy One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome These words are razors to my wounded heart And therefore lovely Tamora Queen of Goths That like the stately Phoebe ' mongst her nymphs Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome If thou be pleas'd with this my sudden choice Behold I choose thee Tamora for my bride And will create thee Emperess of Rome Speak Queen of Goths dost thou applaud my choice And here I swear by all the Roman gods- Sith priest and holy water are so near And tapers burn so bright and everything In readiness for Hymenaeus stand- I will not re salute the streets of Rome Or climb my palace till from forth this place I lead espous'd my bride along with me And here in sight of heaven to Rome I swear If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths She will a handmaid be to his desires A loving nurse a mother to his youth Ascend fair Queen Pantheon Lords accompany Your noble Emperor and his lovely bride Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered There shall we consummate our spousal rites I am not bid to wait upon this bride O Titus see O see what thou hast done In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son No foolish Tribune no no son of mine- Nor thou nor these confederates in the deed That hath dishonoured all our family Unworthy brother and unworthy sons But let us give him burial as becomes Give Mutius burial with our bretheren Traitors away He rests not in this tomb This monument five hundred years hath stood Which I have sumptuously re edified Here none but soldiers and Rome 's servitors Repose in fame none basely slain in brawls Bury him where you can he comes not here My lord this is impiety in you My nephew Mutius ' deeds do plead for him He must be buried with his bretheren ' And shall ' What villain was it spake that word He that would vouch it in any place but here What would you bury him in my despite No noble Titus but entreat of thee To pardon Mutius and to bury him Marcus even thou hast struck upon my crest And with these boys mine honour thou hast wounded My foes I do repute you every one So trouble me no more but get you gone He is not with himself let us withdraw Not I till Mutius ' bones be buried Brother for in that name doth nature plead- Father and in that name doth nature speak- Speak thou no more if all the rest will speed Renowned Titus more than half my soul- Dear father soul and substance of us all- Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter His noble nephew here in virtue 's nest That died in honour and Lavinia 's cause Thou art a Roman- be not barbarous The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax That slew himself and wise Laertes ' son Did graciously plead for his funerals Let not young Mutius then that was thy joy Be barr'd his entrance here Rise Marcus rise The dismal'st day is this that e'er I saw To be dishonoured by my sons in Rome Well bury him and bury me the next There lie thy bones sweet Mutius with thy friends Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb Kneeling No man shed tears for noble Mutius He lives in fame that died in virtue 's cause My lord- to step out of these dreary dumps- How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths Is of a sudden thus advanc'd in Rome I know not Marcus but I know it is- Whether by device or no the heavens can tell Is she not then beholding to the man That brought her for this high good turn so far Yes and will nobly him remunerate So Bassianus you have play'd your prize God give you joy sir of your gallant bride And you of yours my lord I say no more Nor wish no less and so I take my leave Traitor if Rome have law or we have power Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape Rape call you it my lord to seize my own My true betrothed love and now my wife But let the laws of Rome determine all Meanwhile am I possess'd of that is mine ' Tis good sir You are very short with us But if we live we 'll be as sharp with you My lord what I have done as best I may Answer I must and shall do with my life Only thus much I give your Grace to know By all the duties that I owe to Rome This noble gentleman Lord Titus here Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd That in the rescue of Lavinia With his own hand did slay his youngest son In zeal to you and highly mov'd to wrath To be controll'd in that he frankly gave Receive him then to favour Saturnine That hath express'd himself in all his deeds A father and a friend to thee and Rome Prince Bassianus leave to plead my deeds ' Tis thou and those that have dishonoured me Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge How I have lov'd and honoured Saturnine My worthy lord if ever Tamora Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine Then hear me speak indifferently for all And at my suit sweet pardon what is past What madam be dishonoured openly And basely put it up without revenge Not so my lord the gods of Rome forfend I should be author to dishonour you But on mine honour dare I undertake For good Lord Titus ' innocence in all Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs Then at my suit look graciously on him Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart Aside to SATURNINUS My lord be rul'd by me Rise Titus rise my Empress hath prevail'd I thank your Majesty and her my lord These words these looks infuse new life in me Titus I am incorporate in Rome A Roman now adopted happily And must advise the Emperor for his good This day all quarrels die Andronicus And let it be mine honour good my lord That I have reconcil'd your friends and you For you Prince Bassianus I have pass'd My word and promise to the Emperor That you will be more mild and tractable And fear not lords- and you Lavinia By my advice all humbled on your knees You shall ask pardon of his Majesty We do and vow to heaven and to his Highness That what we did was mildly as we might Tend'ring our sister 's honour and our own That on mine honour here do I protest Away and talk not trouble us no more Nay nay sweet Emperor we must all be friends The Tribune and his nephews kneel for grace I will not be denied Sweet heart look back Marcus for thy sake and thy brother 's here And at my lovely Tamora 's entreats I do remit these young men 's heinous faults Stand up Lavinia though you left me like a churl I found a friend and sure as death I swore I would not part a bachelor from the priest Come if the Emperor 's court can feast two brides You are my guest Lavinia and your friends This day shall be a love day Tamora To morrow and it please your Majesty To hunt the panther and the hart with me With horn and hound we 'll give your Grace bonjour Be it so Titus and gramercy too Now climbeth Tamora Olympus ' top Safe out of Fortune 's shot and sits aloft Secure of thunder 's crack or lightning flash Advanc'd above pale envy 's threat'ning reach As when the golden sun salutes the morn And having gilt the ocean with his beams Gallops the zodiac in his glistening coach And overlooks the highest peering hills So Tamora Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown Then Aaron arm thy heart and fit thy thoughts To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress And mount her pitch whom thou in triumph long Hast prisoner held fett'red in amorous chains And faster bound to Aaron 's charming eyes Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts I will be bright and shine in pearl and gold To wait upon this new made emperess To wait said I To wanton with this queen This goddess this Semiramis this nymph This siren that will charm Rome 's Saturnine And see his shipwreck and his commonweal 's Hullo what storm is this Chiron thy years wants wit thy wits wants edge And manners to intrude where I am grac'd And may for aught thou knowest affected be Demetrius thou dost over ween in all And so in this to bear me down with braves ' Tis not the difference of a year or two Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate I am as able and as fit as thou To serve and to deserve my mistress ' grace And that my sword upon thee shall approve And plead my passions for Lavinia 's love Aside Clubs clubs These lovers will not keep the peace Why boy although our mother unadvis'd Gave you a dancing rapier by your side Are you so desperate grown to threat your friends Go to have your lath glued within your sheath Till you know better how to handle it Meanwhile sir with the little skill I have Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare Ay boy grow ye so brave They draw Coming forward Why how now lords So near the Emperor 's palace dare ye draw And maintain such a quarrel openly Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge I would not for a million of gold The cause were known to them it most concerns Nor would your noble mother for much more Be so dishonoured in the court of Rome For shame put up Not I till I have sheath'd My rapier in his bosom and withal Thrust those reproachful speeches down his throat That he hath breath'd in my dishonour here For that I am prepar'd and full resolv'd Foul spoken coward that thund'rest with thy tongue And with thy weapon nothing dar'st perform Away I say Now by the gods that warlike Goths adore This pretty brabble will undo us all Why lords and think you not how dangerous It is to jet upon a prince 's right What is Lavinia then become so loose Or Bassianus so degenerate That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd Without controlment justice or revenge Young lords beware an should the Empress know This discord 's ground the music would not please I care not I knew she and all the world I love Lavinia more than all the world Youngling learn thou to make some meaner choice Lavina is thine elder brother 's hope Why are ye mad or know ye not in Rome How furious and impatient they be And can not brook competitors in love I tell you lords you do but plot your deaths By this device Aaron a thousand deaths Would I propose to achieve her whom I love To achieve her- how Why mak'st thou it so strange She is a woman therefore may be woo'd She is a woman therefore may be won She is Lavinia therefore must be lov'd What man more water glideth by the mill Than wots the miller of and easy it is Of a cut loaf to steal a shive we know Though Bassianus be the Emperor 's brother Better than he have worn Vulcan 's badge Aside Ay and as good as Saturninus may Then why should he despair that knows to court it With words fair looks and liberality What hast not thou full often struck a doe And borne her cleanly by the keeper 's nose Why then it seems some certain snatch or so Would serve your turns Ay so the turn were served Aaron thou hast hit it Would you had hit it too Then should not we be tir'd with this ado Why hark ye hark ye and are you such fools To square for this Would it offend you then That both should speed Faith not me Nor me so I were one For shame be friends and join for that you jar ' Tis policy and stratagem must do That you affect and so must you resolve That what you can not as you would achieve You must perforce accomplish as you may Take this of me Lucrece was not more chaste Than this Lavinia Bassianus ' love A speedier course than ling'ring languishment Must we pursue and I have found the path My lords a solemn hunting is in hand There will the lovely Roman ladies troop The forest walks are wide and spacious And many unfrequented plots there are Fitted by kind for rape and villainy Single you thither then this dainty doe And strike her home by force if not by words This way or not at all stand you in hope Come come our Empress with her sacred wit To villainy and vengeance consecrate Will we acquaint with all what we intend And she shall file our engines with advice That will not suffer you to square yourselves But to your wishes ' height advance you both The Emperor 's court is like the house of Fame The palace full of tongues of eyes and ears The woods are ruthless dreadful deaf and dull There speak and strike brave boys and take your turns There serve your lust shadowed from heaven 's eye And revel in Lavinia 's treasury Thy counsel lad smells of no cowardice Sit fas aut nefas till I find the stream To cool this heat a charm to calm these fits Per Styga per manes vehor Exeunt The hunt is up the morn is bright and grey The fields are fragrant and the woods are green Uncouple here and let us make a bay And wake the Emperor and his lovely bride And rouse the Prince and ring a hunter 's peal That all the court may echo with the noise Sons let it be your charge as it is ours To attend the Emperor 's person carefully I have been troubled in my sleep this night But dawning day new comfort hath inspir'd And you have rung it lustily my lords- Somewhat too early for new married ladies Lavinia how say you I say no I have been broad awake two hours and more Come on then horse and chariots let us have And to our sport To TAMORA Madam now shall ye see Our Roman hunting I have dogs my lord Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase And climb the highest promontory top And I have horse will follow where the game Makes way and run like swallows o'er the plain Chiron we hunt not we with horse nor hound But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground Exeunt He that had wit would think that I had none To bury so much gold under a tree And never after to inherit it Let him that thinks of me so abjectly Know that this gold must coin a stratagem Which cunningly effected will beget A very excellent piece of villainy And so repose sweet gold for their unrest My lovely Aaron wherefore look'st thou sad When everything does make a gleeful boast The birds chant melody on every bush The snakes lie rolled in the cheerful sun The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground Under their sweet shade Aaron let us sit And while the babbling echo mocks the hounds Replying shrilly to the well tun'd horns As if a double hunt were heard at once Let us sit down and mark their yellowing noise And- after conflict such as was suppos'd The wand'ring prince and Dido once enjoyed When with a happy storm they were surpris'd And curtain'd with a counsel keeping cave- We may each wreathed in the other 's arms Our pastimes done possess a golden slumber Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds Be unto us as is a nurse 's song Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep Madam though Venus govern your desires Saturn is dominator over mine What signifies my deadly standing eye My silence and my cloudy melancholy My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls Even as an adder when she doth unroll To do some fatal execution No madam these are no venereal signs Vengeance is in my heart death in my hand Blood and revenge are hammering in my head Hark Tamora the empress of my soul Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee- This is the day of doom for Bassianus His Philomel must lose her tongue to day Thy sons make pillage of her chastity And wash their hands in Bassianus ' blood Seest thou this letter Take it up I pray thee And give the King this fatal plotted scroll Now question me no more we are espied Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty Which dreads not yet their lives ' destruction Ah my sweet Moor sweeter to me than life No more great Empress Bassianus comes Be cross with him and I 'll go fetch thy sons To back thy quarrels whatsoe'er they be Exit Who have we here Rome 's royal Emperess Unfurnish'd of her well beseeming troop Or is it Dian habited like her Who hath abandoned her holy groves To see the general hunting in this forest Saucy controller of my private steps Had I the pow'r that some say Dian had Thy temples should be planted presently With horns as was Actaeon 's and the hounds Should drive upon thy new transformed limbs Unmannerly intruder as thou art Under your patience gentle Emperess ' Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning And to be doubted that your Moor and you Are singled forth to try thy experiments Jove shield your husband from his hounds to day ' Tis pity they should take him for a stag Believe me Queen your swarth Cimmerian Doth make your honour of his body 's hue Spotted detested and abominable Why are you sequest'red from all your train Dismounted from your snow white goodly steed And wand'red hither to an obscure plot Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor If foul desire had not conducted you And being intercepted in your sport Great reason that my noble lord be rated For sauciness I pray you let us hence And let her joy her raven coloured love This valley fits the purpose passing well The King my brother shall have notice of this Ay for these slips have made him noted long Good king to be so mightily abused Why I have patience to endure all this How now dear sovereign and our gracious mother Why doth your Highness look so pale and wan Have I not reason think you to look pale These two have ' ticed me hither to this place A barren detested vale you see it is The trees though summer yet forlorn and lean Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe Here never shines the sun here nothing breeds Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven And when they show'd me this abhorred pit They told me here at dead time of the night A thousand fiends a thousand hissing snakes Ten thousand swelling toads as many urchins Would make such fearful and confused cries As any mortal body hearing it Should straight fall mad or else die suddenly No sooner had they told this hellish tale But straight they told me they would bind me here Unto the body of a dismal yew And leave me to this miserable death And then they call'd me foul adulteress Lascivious Goth and all the bitterest terms That ever ear did hear to such effect And had you not by wondrous fortune come This vengeance on me had they executed Revenge it as you love your mother 's life Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children This is a witness that I am thy son And this for me struck home to show my strength Ay come Semiramis- nay barbarous Tamora For no name fits thy nature but thy own Give me the poniard you shall know my boys Your mother 's hand shall right your mother 's wrong Stay madam here is more belongs to her First thrash the corn then after burn the straw This minion stood upon her chastity Upon her nuptial vow her loyalty And with that painted hope braves your mightiness And shall she carry this unto her grave An if she do I would I were an eunuch Drag hence her husband to some secret hole And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust But when ye have the honey we desire Let not this wasp outlive us both to sting I warrant you madam we will make that sure Come mistress now perforce we will enjoy That nice preserved honesty of yours O Tamora thou bearest a woman 's face- I will not hear her speak away with her Sweet lords entreat her hear me but a word Listen fair madam let it be your glory To see her tears but be your heart to them As unrelenting flint to drops of rain When did the tiger 's young ones teach the dam O do not learn her wrath- she taught it thee The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny Yet every mother breeds not sons alike To CHIRON Do thou entreat her show a woman 's pity What wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard ' Tis true the raven doth not hatch a lark Yet have I heard- O could I find it now!- The lion mov'd with pity did endure To have his princely paws par'd all away Some say that ravens foster forlorn children The whilst their own birds famish in their nests O be to me though thy hard heart say no Nothing so kind but something pitiful I know not what it means away with her O let me teach thee For my father 's sake That gave thee life when well he might have slain thee Be not obdurate open thy deaf ears Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me Even for his sake am I pitiless Remember boys I pour'd forth tears in vain To save your brother from the sacrifice But fierce Andronicus would not relent Therefore away with her and use her as you will The worse to her the better lov'd of me O Tamora be call'd a gentle queen And with thine own hands kill me in this place For ' tis not life that I have begg'd so long Poor I was slain when Bassianus died What beg'st thou then Fond woman let me go ' Tis present death I beg and one thing more That womanhood denies my tongue to tell O keep me from their worse than killing lust And tumble me into some loathsome pit Where never man 's eye may behold my body Do this and be a charitable murderer So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee No let them satisfy their lust on thee Away for thou hast stay'd us here too long No grace no womanhood Ah beastly creature The blot and enemy to our general name Confusion fall- Nay then I 'll stop your mouth Bring thou her husband This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him Farewell my sons see that you make her sure Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed Till all the Andronici be made away Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor And let my spleenful sons this trull deflower Exit Come on my lords the better foot before Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit Where I espied the panther fast asleep My sight is very dull whate'er it bodes And mine I promise you were it not for shame Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile What art thou fallen What subtle hole is this Whose mouth is covered with rude growing briers Upon whose leaves are drops of new shed blood As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers A very fatal place it seems to me Speak brother hast thou hurt thee with the fall O brother with the dismal'st object hurt That ever eye with sight made heart lament Aside Now will I fetch the King to find them here That he thereby may have a likely guess How these were they that made away his brother Exit Why dost not comfort me and help me out From this unhallow'd and blood stained hole I am surprised with an uncouth fear A chilling sweat o'er runs my trembling joints My heart suspects more than mine eye can see To prove thou hast a true divining heart Aaron and thou look down into this den And see a fearful sight of blood and death Aaron is gone and my compassionate heart Will not permit mine eyes once to behold The thing whereat it trembles by surmise O tell me who it is for ne'er till now Was I a child to fear I know not what Lord Bassianus lies beray'd in blood All on a heap like to a slaughtered lamb In this detested dark blood drinking pit If it be dark how dost thou know ' tis he Upon his bloody finger he doth wear A precious ring that lightens all this hole Which like a taper in some monument Doth shine upon the dead man 's earthy cheeks And shows the ragged entrails of this pit So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus When he by night lay bath'd in maiden blood O brother help me with thy fainting hand- If fear hath made thee faint as me it hath- Out of this fell devouring receptacle As hateful as Cocytus ' misty mouth Reach me thy hand that I may help thee out Or wanting strength to do thee so much good I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb Of this deep pit poor Bassianus ' grave I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink Nor I no strength to climb without thy help Thy hand once more I will not loose again Till thou art here aloft or I below Thou canst not come to me- I come to thee Falls in Along with me I 'll see what hole is here And what he is that now is leapt into it Say who art thou that lately didst descend Into this gaping hollow of the earth The unhappy sons of old Andronicus Brought hither in a most unlucky hour To find thy brother Bassianus dead My brother dead I know thou dost but jest He and his lady both are at the lodge Upon the north side of this pleasant chase ' Tis not an hour since I left them there We know not where you left them all alive But out alas here have we found him dead Where is my lord the King Here Tamora though griev'd with killing grief Where is thy brother Bassianus Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound Poor Bassianus here lies murdered Then all too late I bring this fatal writ The complot of this timeless tragedy And wonder greatly that man 's face can fold In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny My gracious lord here is the bag of gold To TITUS Two of thy whelps fell curs of bloody What are they in this pit O wondrous thing How easily murder is discovered High Emperor upon my feeble knee I beg this boon with tears not lightly shed That this fell fault of my accursed sons- Accursed if the fault be prov'd in them- If it be prov'd You see it is apparent Who found this letter Tamora was it you Andronicus himself did take it up I did my lord yet let me be their bail For by my fathers ' reverend tomb I vow They shall be ready at your Highness ' will To answer their suspicion with their lives Thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me Some bring the murdered body some the murderers Let them not speak a word- the guilt is plain For by my soul were there worse end than death That end upon them should be executed Andronicus I will entreat the King Fear not thy sons they shall do well enough Come Lucius come stay not to talk with them Exeunt So now go tell an if thy tongue can speak Who ' twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee Write down thy mind bewray thy meaning so An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe See how with signs and tokens she can scrowl Go home call for sweet water wash thy hands She hath no tongue to call nor hands to wash And so let 's leave her to her silent walks An ' twere my cause I should go hang myself If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord Who is this?- my niece that flies away so fast Cousin a word where is your husband If I do dream would all my wealth would wake me If I do wake some planet strike me down That I may slumber an eternal sleep Speak gentle niece What stern ungentle hands Hath lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare Of her two branches- those sweet ornaments Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in And might not gain so great a happiness As half thy love Why dost not speak to me Alas a crimson river of warm blood Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips Coming and going with thy honey breath But sure some Tereus hath deflowered thee And lest thou shouldst detect him cut thy tongue Ah now thou turn'st away thy face for shame And notwithstanding all this loss of blood- As from a conduit with three issuing spouts- Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan 's face Blushing to be encount'red with a cloud Shall I speak for thee Shall I say ' tis so O that I knew thy heart and knew the beast That I might rail at him to ease my mind Sorrow concealed like an oven stopp'd Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is Fair Philomel why she but lost her tongue And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind But lovely niece that mean is cut from thee A craftier Tereus cousin hast thou met And he hath cut those pretty fingers off That could have better sew'd than Philomel O had the monster seen those lily hands Tremble like aspen leaves upon a lute And make the silken strings delight to kiss them He would not then have touch'd them for his life Or had he heard the heavenly harmony Which that sweet tongue hath made He would have dropp'd his knife and fell asleep As Cerberus at the Thracian poet 's feet Come let us go and make thy father blind For such a sight will blind a father 's eye One hour 's storm will drown the fragrant meads What will whole months of tears thy father 's eyes Do not draw back for we will mourn with thee O could our mourning case thy misery Exeunt Hear me grave fathers noble Tribunes stay For pity of mine age whose youth was spent In dangerous wars whilst you securely slept For all my blood in Rome 's great quarrel shed For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd And for these bitter tears which now you see Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks Be pitiful to my condemned sons Whose souls are not corrupted as ' tis thought For two and twenty sons I never wept Because they died in honour 's lofty bed O noble father you lament in vain The Tribunes hear you not no man is by And you recount your sorrows to a stone Ah Lucius for thy brothers let me plead Grave Tribunes once more I entreat of you My gracious lord no tribune hears you speak Why ' tis no matter man if they did hear They would not mark me if they did mark They would not pity me yet plead I must And bootless unto them Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones Who though they can not answer my distress Yet in some sort they are better than the Tribunes For that they will not intercept my tale When I do weep they humbly at my feet Receive my tears and seem to weep with me And were they but attired in grave weeds Rome could afford no tribunes like to these A stone is soft as wax tribunes more hard than stones A stone is silent and offendeth not And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death To rescue my two brothers from their death For which attempt the judges have pronounc'd My everlasting doom of banishment O happy man they have befriended thee Why foolish Lucius dost thou not perceive That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers Tigers must prey and Rome affords no prey But me and mine how happy art thou then From these devourers to be banished But who comes with our brother Marcus here Titus prepare thy aged eyes to weep Or if not so thy noble heart to break I bring consuming sorrow to thine age Will it consume me Let me see it then This was thy daughter Why Marcus so she is Ay me this object kills me Faint hearted boy arise and look upon her Speak Lavinia what accursed hand Hath made thee handless in thy father 's sight What fool hath added water to the sea Or brought a fagot to bright burning Troy My grief was at the height before thou cam'st And now like Nilus it disdaineth bounds Give me a sword I 'll chop off my hands too For they have fought for Rome and all in vain And they have nurs'd this woe in feeding life In bootless prayer have they been held up And they have serv'd me to effectless use Now all the service I require of them Is that the one will help to cut the other ' Tis well Lavinia that thou hast no hands For hands to do Rome service is but vain Speak gentle sister who hath martyr'd thee O that delightful engine of her thoughts That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage Where like a sweet melodious bird it sung Sweet varied notes enchanting every ear O say thou for her who hath done this deed O thus I found her straying in the park Seeking to hide herself as doth the deer That hath receiv'd some unrecuring wound It was my dear and he that wounded her Hath hurt me more than had he kill'd me dead For now I stand as one upon a rock Environ'd with a wilderness of sea Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave Expecting ever when some envious surge Will in his brinish bowels swallow him This way to death my wretched sons are gone Here stands my other son a banish'd man And here my brother weeping at my woes But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn Is dear Lavinia dearer than my soul Had I but seen thy picture in this plight It would have madded me what shall I do Now I behold thy lively body so Thou hast no hands to wipe away thy tears Nor tongue to tell me who hath martyr'd thee Thy husband he is dead and for his death Thy brothers are condemn'd and dead by this Look Marcus Ah son Lucius look on her When I did name her brothers then fresh tears Stood on her cheeks as doth the honey dew Upon a gath'red lily almost withered Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband Perchance because she knows them innocent If they did kill thy husband then be joyful Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them No no they would not do so foul a deed Witness the sorrow that their sister makes Gentle Lavinia let me kiss thy lips Or make some sign how I may do thee ease Shall thy good uncle and thy brother Lucius And thou and I sit round about some fountain Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks How they are stain'd like meadows yet not dry With miry slime left on them by a flood And in the fountain shall we gaze so long Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness And made a brine pit with our bitter tears Or shall we cut away our hands like thine Or shall we bite our tongues and in dumb shows Pass the remainder of our hateful days What shall we do Let us that have our tongues Plot some device of further misery To make us wonder'd at in time to come Sweet father cease your tears for at your grief See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps Patience dear niece Good Titus dry thine eyes Ah Marcus Marcus Brother well I wot Thy napkin can not drink a tear of mine For thou poor man hast drown'd it with thine own Ah my Lavinia I will wipe thy cheeks Mark Marcus mark I understand her signs Had she a tongue to speak now would she say That to her brother which I said to thee His napkin with his true tears all bewet Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks O what a sympathy of woe is this As far from help as Limbo is from bliss Titus Andronicus my lord the Emperor Sends thee this word that if thou love thy sons Let Marcus Lucius or thyself old Titus Or any one of you chop off your hand And send it to the King he for the same Will send thee hither both thy sons alive And that shall be the ransom for their fault O gracious Emperor O gentle Aaron Did ever raven sing so like a lark That gives sweet tidings of the sun 's uprise With all my heart I 'll send the Emperor my hand Good Aaron wilt thou help to chop it off Stay father for that noble hand of thine That hath thrown down so many enemies Shall not be sent My hand will serve the turn My youth can better spare my blood than you And therefore mine shall save my brothers ' lives Which of your hands hath not defended Rome And rear'd aloft the bloody battle axe Writing destruction on the enemy 's castle O none of both but are of high desert My hand hath been but idle let it serve To ransom my two nephews from their death Then have I kept it to a worthy end Nay come agree whose hand shall go along For fear they die before their pardon come My hand shall go By heaven it shall not go Sirs strive no more such with'red herbs as these Are meet for plucking up and therefore mine Sweet father if I shall be thought thy son Let me redeem my brothers both from death And for our father 's sake and mother 's care Now let me show a brother 's love to thee Agree between you I will spare my hand Then I 'll go fetch an axe But I will use the axe Come hither Aaron I 'll deceive them both Lend me thy hand and I will give thee mine Aside If that be call'd deceit I will be honest And never whilst I live deceive men so But I 'll deceive you in another sort And that you 'll say ere half an hour pass I go Andronicus and for thy hand Look by and by to have thy sons with thee Aside Their heads I mean O how this villainy Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it Let fools do good and fair men call for grace Aaron will have his soul black like his face Exit O here I lift this one hand up to heaven And bow this feeble ruin to the earth If any power pities wretched tears To that I call To LAVINIA What would'st thou kneel with me Do then dear heart for heaven shall hear our prayers Or with our sighs we 'll breathe the welkin dim And stain the sun with fog as sometime clouds When they do hug him in their melting bosoms O brother speak with possibility And do not break into these deep extremes Is not my sorrow deep having no bottom Then be my passions bottomless with them But yet let reason govern thy lament If there were reason for these miseries Then into limits could I bind my woes When heaven doth weep doth not the earth o'erflow If the winds rage doth not the sea wax mad Threat'ning the welkin with his big swol'n face And wilt thou have a reason for this coil I am the sea hark how her sighs do blow She is the weeping welkin I the earth Then must my sea be moved with her sighs Then must my earth with her continual tears Become a deluge overflow'd and drown'd For why my bowels can not hide her woes But like a drunkard must I vomit them Then give me leave for losers will have leave To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues Worthy Andronicus ill art thou repaid For that good hand thou sent'st the Emperor Here are the heads of thy two noble sons And here 's thy hand in scorn to thee sent back- Thy grief their sports thy resolution mock'd That woe is me to think upon thy woes More than remembrance of my father 's death Exit Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily And be my heart an ever burning hell These miseries are more than may be borne To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal But sorrow flouted at is double death Ah that this sight should make so deep a wound And yet detested life not shrink thereat That ever death should let life bear his name Where life hath no more interest but to breathe Alas poor heart that kiss is comfortless As frozen water to a starved snake When will this fearful slumber have an end Now farewell flatt'ry die Andronicus Thou dost not slumber see thy two sons ' heads Thy warlike hand thy mangled daughter here Thy other banish'd son with this dear sight Struck pale and bloodless and thy brother I Even like a stony image cold and numb Ah now no more will I control thy griefs Rent off thy silver hair thy other hand Gnawing with thy teeth and be this dismal sight The closing up of our most wretched eyes Now is a time to storm why art thou still Ha ha ha Why dost thou laugh It fits not with this hour Why I have not another tear to shed Besides this sorrow is an enemy And would usurp upon my wat'ry eyes And make them blind with tributary tears Then which way shall I find Revenge 's cave For these two heads do seem to speak to me And threat me I shall never come to bliss Till all these mischiefs be return'd again Even in their throats that have committed them Come let me see what task I have to do You heavy people circle me about That I may turn me to each one of you And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs The vow is made Come brother take a head And in this hand the other will I bear And Lavinia thou shalt be employ'd in this Bear thou my hand sweet wench between thy teeth As for thee boy go get thee from my sight Thou art an exile and thou must not stay Hie to the Goths and raise an army there And if ye love me as I think you do Let 's kiss and part for we have much to do Farewell Andronicus my noble father The woefull'st man that ever liv'd in Rome Farewell proud Rome till Lucius come again He leaves his pledges dearer than his life Farewell Lavinia my noble sister O would thou wert as thou tofore hast been But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives But in oblivion and hateful griefs If Lucius live he will requite your wrongs And make proud Saturnine and his emperess Beg at the gates like Tarquin and his queen Now will I to the Goths and raise a pow'r To be reveng'd on Rome and Saturnine Exit So so now sit and look you eat no more Than will preserve just so much strength in us As will revenge these bitter woes of ours Marcus unknit that sorrow wreathen knot Thy niece and I poor creatures want our hands And can not passionate our tenfold grief With folded arms This poor right hand of mine Is left to tyrannize upon my breast Who when my heart all mad with misery Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh Then thus I thump it down To LAVINIA Thou map of woe that thus dost talk in signs When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still Wound it with sighing girl kill it with groans Or get some little knife between thy teeth And just against thy heart make thou a hole That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall May run into that sink and soaking in Drown the lamenting fool in sea salt tears Fie brother fie Teach her not thus to lay Such violent hands upon her tender life How now Has sorrow made thee dote already Why Marcus no man should be mad but I. What violent hands can she lay on her life Ah wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o'er How Troy was burnt and he made miserable O handle not the theme to talk of hands Lest we remember still that we have none Fie fie how franticly I square my talk As if we should forget we had no hands If Marcus did not name the word of hands Come let 's fall to and gentle girl eat this Here is no drink Hark Marcus what she says- I can interpret all her martyr'd signs She says she drinks no other drink but tears Brew'd with her sorrow mesh'd upon her cheeks Speechless complainer I will learn thy thought In thy dumb action will I be as perfect As begging hermits in their holy prayers Thou shalt not sigh nor hold thy stumps to heaven Nor wink nor nod nor kneel nor make a sign But I of these will wrest an alphabet And by still practice learn to know thy meaning Good grandsire leave these bitter deep laments Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale Alas the tender boy in passion mov'd Doth weep to see his grandsire 's heaviness Peace tender sapling thou art made of tears And tears will quickly melt thy life away At that that I have kill'd my lord- a fly Out on thee murderer thou kill'st my heart Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny A deed of death done on the innocent Becomes not Titus ' brother Get thee gone I see thou art not for my company Alas my lord I have but kill'd a fly ' But ' How if that fly had a father and mother How would he hang his slender gilded wings And buzz lamenting doings in the air Poor harmless fly That with his pretty buzzing melody Came here to make us merry And thou hast kill'd him Pardon me sir it was a black ill favour'd fly Like to the Empress ' Moor therefore I kill'd him O O O Then pardon me for reprehending thee For thou hast done a charitable deed Give me thy knife I will insult on him Flattering myself as if it were the Moor Come hither purposely to poison me There 's for thyself and that 's for Tamora Ah sirrah Yet I think we are not brought so low But that between us we can kill a fly That comes in likeness of a coal black Moor Alas poor man grief has so wrought on him He takes false shadows for true substances Come take away Lavinia go with me I 'll to thy closet and go read with thee Sad stories chanced in the times of old Come boy and go with me thy sight is young And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle Exeunt Help grandsire help my aunt Lavinia Follows me everywhere I know not why Good uncle Marcus see how swift she comes Alas sweet aunt I know not what you mean Stand by me Lucius do not fear thine aunt She loves thee boy too well to do thee harm Ay when my father was in Rome she did What means my niece Lavinia by these signs Fear her not Lucius somewhat doth she mean See Lucius see how much she makes of thee Somewhither would she have thee go with her Ah boy Cornelia never with more care Read to her sons than she hath read to thee Sweet poetry and Tully 's Orator Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus My lord I know not I nor can I guess Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her For I have heard my grandsire say full oft Extremity of griefs would make men mad And I have read that Hecuba of Troy Ran mad for sorrow That made me to fear Although my lord I know my noble aunt Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did And would not but in fury fright my youth Which made me down to throw my books and fly- Causeless perhaps But pardon me sweet aunt And madam if my uncle Marcus go I will most willingly attend your ladyship Lucius I will LAVINIA turns over with her How now Lavinia Marcus what means this Some book there is that she desires to see Which is it girl of these?- Open them boy.- But thou art deeper read and better skill'd Come and take choice of all my library And so beguile thy sorrow till the heavens Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus I think she means that there were more than one Confederate in the fact ay more there was Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge Lucius what book is that she tosseth so Grandsire ' tis Ovid 's Metamorphoses My mother gave it me For love of her that 's gone Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest Soft So busily she turns the leaves Help her What would she find Lavinia shall I read This is the tragic tale of Philomel And treats of Tereus ' treason and his rape And rape I fear was root of thy annoy See brother see Note how she quotes the leaves Lavinia wert thou thus surpris'd sweet girl Ravish'd and wrong'd as Philomela was Forc'd in the ruthless vast and gloomy woods See see Ay such a place there is where we did hunt- O had we never never hunted there!- Pattern'd by that the poet here describes By nature made for murders and for rapes O why should nature build so foul a den Unless the gods delight in tragedies Give signs sweet girl for here are none but friends What Roman lord it was durst do the deed Or slunk not Saturnine as Tarquin erst That left the camp to sin in Lucrece ' bed Sit down sweet niece brother sit down by me Apollo Pallas Jove or Mercury Inspire me that I may this treason find My lord look here Look here Lavinia ' Stuprum- Chiron- Demetrius ' What what the lustful sons of Tamora Performers of this heinous bloody deed Magni Dominator poli Tam lentus audis scelera tam lentus vides O calm thee gentle lord although I know There is enough written upon this earth To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts And arm the minds of infants to exclaims My lord kneel down with me Lavinia kneel And kneel sweet boy the Roman Hector 's hope And swear with me- as with the woeful fere And father of that chaste dishonoured dame Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece ' rape- That we will prosecute by good advice Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths And see their blood or die with this reproach ' Tis sure enough an you knew how But if you hunt these bear whelps then beware The dam will wake and if she wind ye once She 's with the lion deeply still in league And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back And when he sleeps will she do what she list You are a young huntsman Marcus let alone And come I will go get a leaf of brass And with a gad of steel will write these words And lay it by The angry northern wind Will blow these sands like Sibyl 's leaves abroad And where 's our lesson then Boy what say you I say my lord that if I were a man Their mother 's bedchamber should not be safe For these base bondmen to the yoke of Rome Ay that 's my boy Thy father hath full oft For his ungrateful country done the like And uncle so will I an if I live Come go with me into mine armoury Lucius I 'll fit thee and withal my boy Shall carry from me to the Empress ' sons Presents that I intend to send them both Come come thou'lt do my message wilt thou not Ay with my dagger in their bosoms grandsire No boy not so I 'll teach thee another course Lavinia come Marcus look to my house Lucius and I 'll go brave it at the court Ay marry will we sir and we 'll be waited on O heavens can you hear a good man groan And not relent or not compassion him Marcus attend him in his ecstasy That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart Than foemen 's marks upon his batt'red shield But yet so just that he will not revenge Revenge the heavens for old Andronicus Exit Demetrius here 's the son of Lucius He hath some message to deliver us Ay some mad message from his mad grandfather My lords with all the humbleness I may I greet your honours from Andronicus- Aside And pray the Roman gods confound you both Gramercy lovely Lucius What 's the news Aside That you are both decipher'd that 's the news For villains mark'd with rape.- May it please you My grandsire well advis'd hath sent by me The goodliest weapons of his armoury To gratify your honourable youth The hope of Rome for so he bid me say And so I do and with his gifts present Your lordships that whenever you have need You may be armed and appointed well And so I leave you both- Aside like bloody villains What 's here A scroll and written round about Let 's see Reads ' Integer vitae scelerisque purus Non eget Mauri iaculis nec arcu ' O ' tis a verse in Horace I know it well I read it in the grammar long ago Ay just- a verse in Horace Right you have it Aside Now what a thing it is to be an ass Here 's no sound jest The old man hath found their guilt And sends them weapons wrapp'd about with lines That wound beyond their feeling to the quick But were our witty Empress well afoot She would applaud Andronicus ' conceit But let her rest in her unrest awhile- And now young lords was't not a happy star Led us to Rome strangers and more than so Captives to be advanced to this height It did me good before the palace gate To brave the Tribune in his brother 's hearing But me more good to see so great a lord Basely insinuate and send us gifts Had he not reason Lord Demetrius Did you not use his daughter very friendly I would we had a thousand Roman dames At such a bay by turn to serve our lust A charitable wish and full of love Here lacks but your mother for to say amen And that would she for twenty thousand more Come let us go and pray to all the gods For our beloved mother in her pains Aside Pray to the devils the gods have given us over Why do the Emperor 's trumpets flourish thus Belike for joy the Emperor hath a son Soft who comes here Good morrow lords O tell me did you see Aaron the Moor Well more or less or ne'er a whit at all Here Aaron is and what with Aaron now O gentle Aaron we are all undone Now help or woe betide thee evermore Why what a caterwauling dost thou keep What dost thou wrap and fumble in thy arms O that which I would hide from heaven 's eye Our Empress ' shame and stately Rome 's disgrace She is delivered lord she is delivered To whom I mean she is brought a bed Well God give her good rest What hath he sent her A devil Why then she is the devil 's dam A joyful issue A joyless dismal black and sorrowful issue Here is the babe as loathsome as a toad Amongst the fair fac'd breeders of our clime The Empress sends it thee thy stamp thy seal And bids thee christen it with thy dagger 's point Zounds ye whore Is black so base a hue Sweet blowse you are a beauteous blossom sure Villain what hast thou done That which thou canst not undo Thou hast undone our mother Villain I have done thy mother And therein hellish dog thou hast undone her Woe to her chance and damn'd her loathed choice Accurs'd the offspring of so foul a fiend It shall not live It shall not die Aaron it must the mother wills it so What must it nurse Then let no man but I Do execution on my flesh and blood I 'll broach the tadpole on my rapier 's point Nurse give it me my sword shall soon dispatch it Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus My mistress is my mistress this my self The vigour and the picture of my youth This before all the world do I prefer This maugre all the world will I keep safe Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome By this our mother is for ever sham'd Rome will despise her for this foul escape The Emperor in his rage will doom her death I blush to think upon this ignomy Why there 's the privilege your beauty bears Fie treacherous hue that will betray with blushing The close enacts and counsels of thy heart Here 's a young lad fram'd of another leer Look how the black slave smiles upon the father As who should say ' Old lad I am thine own ' He is your brother lords sensibly fed Of that self blood that first gave life to you And from your womb where you imprisoned were He is enfranchised and come to light Nay he is your brother by the surer side Although my seal be stamped in his face Aaron what shall I say unto the Empress Advise thee Aaron what is to be done And we will all subscribe to thy advice Save thou the child so we may all be safe Then sit we down and let us all consult My son and I will have the wind of you Keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety How many women saw this child of his Why so brave lords When we join in league I am a lamb but if you brave the Moor The chafed boar the mountain lioness The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms But say again how many saw the child Cornelia the midwife and myself And no one else but the delivered Empress The Emperess the midwife and yourself Two may keep counsel when the third 's away Go to the Empress tell her this I said He kills her Weeke weeke So cries a pig prepared to the spit What mean'st thou Aaron Wherefore didst thou this O Lord sir ' tis a deed of policy Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours- A long tongu'd babbling gossip No lords no And now be it known to you my full intent Not far one Muliteus my countryman- His wife but yesternight was brought to bed His child is like to her fair as you are Go pack with him and give the mother gold And tell them both the circumstance of all And how by this their child shall be advanc'd And be received for the Emperor 's heir And substituted in the place of mine To calm this tempest whirling in the court And let the Emperor dandle him for his own Hark ye lords You see I have given her physic Aaron I see thou wilt not trust the air With secrets For this care of Tamora Herself and hers are highly bound to thee Now to the Goths as swift as swallow flies There to dispose this treasure in mine arms And secretly to greet the Empress ' friends Come on you thick lipp'd slave I 'll bear you hence For it is you that puts us to our shifts I 'll make you feed on berries and on roots And feed on curds and whey and suck the goat And cabin in a cave and bring you up To be a warrior and command a camp Come Marcus come kinsmen this is the way Sir boy let me see your archery Look ye draw home enough and ' tis there straight Terras Astrea reliquit Be you rememb'red Marcus she 's gone she 's fled Sirs take you to your tools You cousins shall Go sound the ocean and cast your nets Happily you may catch her in the sea Yet there 's as little justice as at land No Publius and Sempronius you must do it ' Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade And pierce the inmost centre of the earth Then when you come to Pluto 's region I pray you deliver him this petition Tell him it is for justice and for aid And that it comes from old Andronicus Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome Ah Rome Well well I made thee miserable What time I threw the people 's suffrages On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me Go get you gone and pray be careful all And leave you not a man of war unsearch'd This wicked Emperor may have shipp'd her hence And kinsmen then we may go pipe for justice O Publius is not this a heavy case To see thy noble uncle thus distract Therefore my lords it highly us concerns By day and night t ' attend him carefully And feed his humour kindly as we may Till time beget some careful remedy Kinsmen his sorrows are past remedy Join with the Goths and with revengeful war Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine Publius how now How now my masters What have you met with her No my good lord but Pluto sends you word If you will have Revenge from hell you shall Marry for Justice she is so employ'd He thinks with Jove in heaven or somewhere else So that perforce you must needs stay a time He doth me wrong to feed me with delays I 'll dive into the burning lake below And pull her out of Acheron by the heels Marcus we are but shrubs no cedars we No big bon'd men fram'd of the Cyclops ' size But metal Marcus steel to the very back Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear And sith there 's no justice in earth nor hell We will solicit heaven and move the gods To send down justice for to wreak our wrongs Come to this gear You are a good archer Marcus Kinsmen shoot all your shafts into the court We will afflict the Emperor in his pride Now masters draw They shoot O well said Lucius Good boy in Virgo 's lap Give it Pallas My lord I aim a mile beyond the moon Your letter is with Jupiter by this Ha ha Publius Publius hast thou done See see thou hast shot off one of Taurus ' horns This was the sport my lord when Publius shot The Bull being gall'd gave Aries such a knock That down fell both the Ram 's horns in the court And who should find them but the Empress ' villain She laugh'd and told the Moor he should not choose But give them to his master for a present Why there it goes God give his lordship joy Ho the gibbet maker He says that he hath taken them down again for the man must not be hang'd till the next week But what says Jupiter I ask thee Alas sir I know not Jupiter I never drank with him in all my life Why villain art not thou the carrier Ay of my pigeons sir nothing else Why didst thou not come from heaven From heaven Alas sir I never came there God forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days Why I am going with my pigeons to the Tribunal Plebs to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the Emperal 's men Why sir that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration and let him deliver the pigeons to the Emperor from you Tell me can you deliver an oration to the Emperor with a grace Nay truly sir I could never say grace in all my life Sirrah come hither Make no more ado But give your pigeons to the Emperor By me thou shalt have justice at his hands Hold hold Meanwhile here 's money for thy charges Give me pen and ink Sirrah can you with a grace deliver up a supplication Ay sir Then here is a supplication for you And when you come to him at the first approach you must kneel then kiss his foot then deliver up your pigeons and then look for your reward I 'll be at hand sir see you do it bravely I warrant you sir let me alone Sirrah hast thou a knife Come let me see it Here Marcus fold it in the oration For thou hast made it like a humble suppliant And when thou hast given it to the Emperor Knock at my door and tell me what he says God be with you sir I will Come Marcus let us go Publius follow me Exeunt Why lords what wrongs are these Was ever seen An emperor in Rome thus overborne Troubled confronted thus and for the extent Of egal justice us'd in such contempt My lords you know as know the mightful gods However these disturbers of our peace Buzz in the people 's ears there nought hath pass'd But even with law against the wilful sons Of old Andronicus And what an if His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks His fits his frenzy and his bitterness And now he writes to heaven for his redress See here 's ' To Jove ' and this ' To Mercury ' This ' To Apollo ' this ' To the God of War'- Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome What 's this but libelling against the Senate And blazoning our unjustice every where A goodly humour is it not my lords As who would say in Rome no justice were But if I live his feigned ecstasies Shall be no shelter to these outrages But he and his shall know that justice lives In Saturninus ' health whom if she sleep He 'll so awake as he in fury shall Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives My gracious lord my lovely Saturnine Lord of my life commander of my thoughts Calm thee and bear the faults of Titus ' age Th ' effects of sorrow for his valiant sons Whose loss hath pierc'd him deep and scarr'd his heart And rather comfort his distressed plight Than prosecute the meanest or the best For these contempts Aside Why thus it shall become High witted Tamora to gloze with all But Titus I have touch'd thee to the quick Thy life blood out if Aaron now be wise Then is all safe the anchor in the port Yes forsooth an your mistriship be Emperial Empress I am but yonder sits the Emperor ' Tis he.- God and Saint Stephen give you godden I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here Go take him away and hang him presently How much money must I have Come sirrah you must be hang'd Hang'd by'r lady then I have brought up a neck to a fair end Exit guarded Despiteful and intolerable wrongs Shall I endure this monstrous villainy I know from whence this same device proceeds May this be borne- as if his traitorous sons That died by law for murder of our brother Have by my means been butchered wrongfully Go drag the villain hither by the hair Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege For this proud mock I 'll be thy slaughterman Sly frantic wretch that holp'st to make me great In hope thyself should govern Rome and me Arm my lords Rome never had more cause The Goths have gathered head and with a power Of high resolved men bent to the spoil They hither march amain under conduct Of Lucius son to old Andronicus Who threats in course of this revenge to do As much as ever Coriolanus did Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths These tidings nip me and I hang the head As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms Ay now begins our sorrows to approach ' Tis he the common people love so much Myself hath often heard them say- When I have walked like a private man- That Lucius ' banishment was wrongfully And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor Why should you fear Is not your city strong Ay but the citizens favour Lucius And will revolt from me to succour him King be thy thoughts imperious like thy name Is the sun dimm'd that gnats do fly in it The eagle suffers little birds to sing And is not careful what they mean thereby Knowing that with the shadow of his wings He can at pleasure stint their melody Even so mayest thou the giddy men of Rome Then cheer thy spirit for know thou Emperor I will enchant the old Andronicus With words more sweet and yet more dangerous Than baits to fish or honey stalks to sheep When as the one is wounded with the bait The other rotted with delicious feed But he will not entreat his son for us If Tamora entreat him then he will For I can smooth and fill his aged ears With golden promises that were his heart Almost impregnable his old ears deaf Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue To AEMILIUS Go thou before to be our ambassador Say that the Emperor requests a parley Of warlike Lucius and appoint the meeting Even at his father 's house the old Andronicus Aemilius do this message honourably And if he stand on hostage for his safety Bid him demand what pledge will please him best Your bidding shall I do effectually Exit Now will I to that old Andronicus And temper him with all the art I have To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths And now sweet Emperor be blithe again And bury all thy fear in my devices Then go successantly and plead to him Approved warriors and my faithful friends I have received letters from great Rome Which signifies what hate they bear their Emperor And how desirous of our sight they are Therefore great lords be as your titles witness Imperious and impatient of your wrongs And wherein Rome hath done you any scath Let him make treble satisfaction Brave slip sprung from the great Andronicus Whose name was once our terror now our comfort Whose high exploits and honourable deeds Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt Be bold in us we 'll follow where thou lead'st Like stinging bees in hottest summer 's day Led by their master to the flow'red fields And be aveng'd on cursed Tamora And as he saith so say we all with him I humbly thank him and I thank you all But who comes here led by a lusty Goth Renowned Lucius from our troops I stray'd To gaze upon a ruinous monastery And as I earnestly did fix mine eye Upon the wasted building suddenly I heard a child cry underneath a wall I made unto the noise when soon I heard The crying babe controll'd with this discourse ' Peace tawny slave half me and half thy dam Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art Had nature lent thee but thy mother 's look Villain thou mightst have been an emperor But where the bull and cow are both milk white They never do beget a coal black calf Peace villain peace!'- even thus he rates the babe- ' For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth Who when he knows thou art the Empress ' babe Will hold thee dearly for thy mother 's sake ' With this my weapon drawn I rush'd upon him Surpris'd him suddenly and brought him hither To use as you think needful of the man O worthy Goth this is the incarnate devil That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand This is the pearl that pleas'd your Empress ' eye And here 's the base fruit of her burning lust Say wall ey'd slave whither wouldst thou convey This growing image of thy fiend like face Why dost not speak What deaf Not a word A halter soldiers Hang him on this tree And by his side his fruit of bastardy Touch not the boy he is of royal blood Too like the sire for ever being good First hang the child that he may see it sprawl- A sight to vex the father 's soul withal Get me a ladder Lucius save the child And bear it from me to the Emperess If thou do this I 'll show thee wondrous things That highly may advantage thee to hear If thou wilt not befall what may befall I 'll speak no more but ' Vengeance rot you all ' Say on an if it please me which thou speak'st Thy child shall live and I will see it nourish'd An if it please thee Why assure thee Lucius ' Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak For I must talk of murders rapes and massacres Acts of black night abominable deeds Complots of mischief treason villainies Ruthful to hear yet piteously perform'd And this shall all be buried in my death Unless thou swear to me my child shall live Tell on thy mind I say thy child shall live Swear that he shall and then I will begin Who should I swear by Thou believest no god That granted how canst thou believe an oath What if I do not as indeed I do not Yet for I know thou art religious And hast a thing within thee called conscience With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies Which I have seen thee careful to observe Therefore I urge thy oath For that I know An idiot holds his bauble for a god And keeps the oath which by that god he swears To that I 'll urge him Therefore thou shalt vow By that same god- what god soe'er it be That thou adorest and hast in reverence- To save my boy to nourish and bring him up Or else I will discover nought to thee Even by my god I swear to thee I will First know thou I begot him on the Empress O most insatiate and luxurious woman Tut Lucius this was but a deed of charity To that which thou shalt hear of me anon ' Twas her two sons that murdered Bassianus They cut thy sister 's tongue and ravish'd her And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou sawest O detestable villain Call'st thou that trimming Why she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd and ' twas Trim sport for them which had the doing of it O barbarous beastly villains like thyself Indeed I was their tutor to instruct them That codding spirit had they from their mother As sure a card as ever won the set That bloody mind I think they learn'd of me As true a dog as ever fought at head Well let my deeds be witness of my worth I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay I wrote the letter that thy father found And hid the gold within that letter mention'd Confederate with the Queen and her two sons And what not done that thou hast cause to rue Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it I play'd the cheater for thy father 's hand And when I had it drew myself apart And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter I pried me through the crevice of a wall When for his hand he had his two sons ' heads Beheld his tears and laugh'd so heartily That both mine eyes were rainy like to his And when I told the Empress of this sport She swooned almost at my pleasing tale And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses What canst thou say all this and never blush Ay like a black dog as the saying is Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds Ay that I had not done a thousand more Even now I curse the day- and yet I think Few come within the compass of my curse- Wherein I did not some notorious ill As kill a man or else devise his death Ravish a maid or plot the way to do it Accuse some innocent and forswear myself Set deadly enmity between two friends Make poor men 's cattle break their necks Set fire on barns and hay stacks in the night And bid the owners quench them with their tears Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves And set them upright at their dear friends ' door Even when their sorrows almost was forgot And on their skins as on the bark of trees Have with my knife carved in Roman letters ' Let not your sorrow die though I am dead ' Tut I have done a thousand dreadful things As willingly as one would kill a fly And nothing grieves me heartily indeed But that I can not do ten thousand more Bring down the devil for he must not die So sweet a death as hanging presently If there be devils would I were a devil To live and burn in everlasting fire So I might have your company in hell But to torment you with my bitter tongue Sirs stop his mouth and let him speak no more My lord there is a messenger from Rome Desires to be admitted to your presence Let him come near Welcome Aemilius What 's the news from Rome Lord Lucius and you Princes of the Goths The Roman Emperor greets you all by me And for he understands you are in arms He craves a parley at your father 's house Willing you to demand your hostages And they shall be immediately deliver'd What says our general Aemilius let the Emperor give his pledges Unto my father and my uncle Marcus And we will come March away Exeunt Thus in this strange and sad habiliment I will encounter with Andronicus And say I am Revenge sent from below To join with him and right his heinous wrongs Knock at his study where they say he keeps To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge Tell him Revenge is come to join with him And work confusion on his enemies Who doth molest my contemplation Is it your trick to make me ope the door That so my sad decrees may fly away And all my study be to no effect You are deceiv'd for what I mean to do See here in bloody lines I have set down And what is written shall be executed Titus I am come to talk with thee No not a word How can I grace my talk Wanting a hand to give it that accord Thou hast the odds of me therefore no more If thou didst know me thou wouldst talk with me I am not mad I know thee well enough Witness this wretched stump witness these crimson lines Witness these trenches made by grief and care Witness the tiring day and heavy night Witness all sorrow that I know thee well For our proud Empress mighty Tamora Is not thy coming for my other hand Know thou sad man I am not Tamora She is thy enemy and I thy friend I am Revenge sent from th ' infernal kingdom To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes Come down and welcome me to this world 's light Confer with me of murder and of death There 's not a hollow cave or lurking place No vast obscurity or misty vale Where bloody murder or detested rape Can couch for fear but I will find them out And in their ears tell them my dreadful name- Revenge which makes the foul offender quake Art thou Revenge and art thou sent to me To be a torment to mine enemies I am therefore come down and welcome me Do me some service ere I come to thee Lo by thy side where Rape and Murder stands Now give some surance that thou art Revenge- Stab them or tear them on thy chariot wheels And then I 'll come and be thy waggoner And whirl along with thee about the globes Provide thee two proper palfreys black as jet To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away And find out murderers in their guilty caves And when thy car is loaden with their heads I will dismount and by thy waggon wheel Trot like a servile footman all day long Even from Hyperion 's rising in the east Until his very downfall in the sea And day by day I 'll do this heavy task So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there These are my ministers and come with me Are they thy ministers What are they call'd Rape and Murder therefore called so 'Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men Good Lord how like the Empress ' sons they are And you the Empress But we worldly men Have miserable mad mistaking eyes O sweet Revenge now do I come to thee And if one arm 's embracement will content thee I will embrace thee in it by and by This closing with him fits his lunacy Whate'er I forge to feed his brain sick humours Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches For now he firmly takes me for Revenge And being credulous in this mad thought I 'll make him send for Lucius his son And whilst I at a banquet hold him sure I 'll find some cunning practice out of hand To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths Or at the least make them his enemies See here he comes and I must ply my theme Long have I been forlorn and all for thee Welcome dread Fury to my woeful house Rapine and Murder you are welcome too How like the Empress and her sons you are Well are you fitted had you but a Moor Could not all hell afford you such a devil For well I wot the Empress never wags But in her company there is a Moor And would you represent our queen aright It were convenient you had such a devil But welcome as you are What shall we do What wouldst thou have us do Andronicus Show me a murderer I 'll deal with him Show me a villain that hath done a rape And I am sent to be reveng'd on him Show me a thousand that hath done thee wrong And I will be revenged on them all Look round about the wicked streets of Rome And when thou find'st a man that 's like thyself Good Murder stab him he 's a murderer Go thou with him and when it is thy hap To find another that is like to thee Good Rapine stab him he is a ravisher Go thou with them and in the Emperor 's court There is a queen attended by a Moor Well shalt thou know her by thine own proportion For up and down she doth resemble thee I pray thee do on them some violent death They have been violent to me and mine Well hast thou lesson'd us this shall we do But would it please thee good Andronicus To send for Lucius thy thrice valiant son Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths And bid him come and banquet at thy house When he is here even at thy solemn feast I will bring in the Empress and her sons The Emperor himself and all thy foes And at thy mercy shall they stoop and kneel And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart What says Andronicus to this device Marcus my brother ' Tis sad Titus calls This will I do and soon return again Exit Now will I hence about thy business And take my ministers along with me Nay nay let Rape and Murder stay with me Or else I 'll call my brother back again And cleave to no revenge but Lucius Aside to her sons What say you boys Will you abide Aside I knew them all though they suppos'd me mad And will o'er reach them in their own devices A pair of cursed hell hounds and their dam Madam depart at pleasure leave us here Farewell Andronicus Revenge now goes To lay a complot to betray thy foes I know thou dost and sweet Revenge farewell Tell us old man how shall we be employ'd Tut I have work enough for you to do Publius come hither Caius and Valentine What is your will Know you these two The Empress ' sons I take them Chiron Demetrius Fie Publius fie thou art too much deceiv'd The one is Murder and Rape is the other 's name And therefore bind them gentle Publius- Caius and Valentine lay hands on them Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour And now I find it therefore bind them sure And stop their mouths if they begin to cry Exit Villains forbear we are the Empress ' sons And therefore do we what we are commanded Stop close their mouths let them not speak a word Is he sure bound Look that you bind them fast Come come Lavinia look thy foes are bound Sirs stop their mouths let them not speak to me But let them hear what fearful words I utter O villains Chiron and Demetrius Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud This goodly summer with your winter mix'd You kill'd her husband and for that vile fault Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death My hand cut off and made a merry jest Both her sweet hands her tongue and that more dear Than hands or tongue her spotless chastity Inhuman traitors you constrain'd and forc'd What would you say if I should let you speak Villains for shame you could not beg for grace Hark wretches how I mean to martyr you This one hand yet is left to cut your throats Whiles that Lavinia ' tween her stumps doth hold The basin that receives your guilty blood You know your mother means to feast with me And calls herself Revenge and thinks me mad Hark villains I will grind your bones to dust And with your blood and it I 'll make a paste And of the paste a coffin I will rear And make two pasties of your shameful heads And bid that strumpet your unhallowed dam Like to the earth swallow her own increase This is the feast that I have bid her to And this the banquet she shall surfeit on For worse than Philomel you us'd my daughter And worse than Progne I will be reveng'd And now prepare your throats Lavinia come Receive the blood and when that they are dead Let me go grind their bones to powder small And with this hateful liquor temper it And in that paste let their vile heads be bak'd Come come be every one officious To make this banquet which I wish may prove More stern and bloody than the Centaurs ' feast Uncle Marcus since ' tis my father 's mind That I repair to Rome I am content FIRST GOTH And ours with thine befall what fortune will Good uncle take you in this barbarous Moor This ravenous tiger this accursed devil Let him receive no sust'nance fetter him Till he be brought unto the Empress ' face For testimony of her foul proceedings And see the ambush of our friends be strong I fear the Emperor means no good to us Some devil whisper curses in my ear And prompt me that my tongue may utter forth The venomous malice of my swelling heart Away inhuman dog unhallowed slave Sirs help our uncle to convey him in What hath the firmament more suns than one What boots it thee to can thyself a sun Rome 's Emperor and nephew break the parle These quarrels must be quietly debated The feast is ready which the careful Titus Hath ordain'd to an honourable end For peace for love for league and good to Rome Please you therefore draw nigh and take your places Marcus we will Welcome my lord welcome dread Queen Welcome ye warlike Goths welcome Lucius And welcome all Although the cheer be poor ' Twill fill your stomachs please you eat of it Why art thou thus attir'd Andronicus Because I would be sure to have all well To entertain your Highness and your Empress We are beholding to you good Andronicus An if your Highness knew my heart you were My lord the Emperor resolve me this Was it well done of rash Virginius To slay his daughter with his own right hand Because she was enforc'd stain'd and deflower'd It was Andronicus Your reason mighty lord Because the girl should not survive her shame And by her presence still renew his sorrows A reason mighty strong and effectual A pattern precedent and lively warrant For me most wretched to perform the like Die die Lavinia and thy shame with thee He kills her And with thy shame thy father 's sorrow die What hast thou done unnatural and unkind Kill'd her for whom my tears have made me blind I am as woeful as Virginius was And have a thousand times more cause than he To do this outrage and it now is done What was she ravish'd Tell who did the deed Will't please you eat Will't please your Highness feed Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus Not I ' twas Chiron and Demetrius They ravish'd her and cut away her tongue And they ' twas they that did her all this wrong Go fetch them hither to us presently Why there they are both baked in this pie Whereof their mother daintily hath fed Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred ' Tis true ' tis true witness my knife 's sharp point Die frantic wretch for this accursed deed Can the son 's eye behold his father bleed There 's meed for meed death for a deadly deed You sad fac'd men people and sons of Rome By uproars sever'd as a flight of fowl Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts O let me teach you how to knit again This scattered corn into one mutual sheaf These broken limbs again into one body Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself And she whom mighty kingdoms curtsy to Like a forlorn and desperate castaway Do shameful execution on herself But if my frosty signs and chaps of age Grave witnesses of true experience Can not induce you to attend my words To Lucius Speak Rome 's dear friend as erst our ancestor When with his solemn tongue he did discourse To love sick Dido 's sad attending ear The story of that baleful burning night When subtle Greeks surpris'd King Priam 's Troy Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears Or who hath brought the fatal engine in That gives our Troy our Rome the civil wound My heart is not compact of flint nor steel Nor can I utter all our bitter grief But floods of tears will drown my oratory And break my utt'rance even in the time When it should move ye to attend me most And force you to commiseration Here 's Rome 's young Captain let him tell the tale While I stand by and weep to hear him speak Then gracious auditory be it known to you That Chiron and the damn'd Demetrius Were they that murd'red our Emperor 's brother And they it were that ravished our sister For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded Our father 's tears despis'd and basely cozen'd Of that true hand that fought Rome 's quarrel out And sent her enemies unto the grave Lastly myself unkindly banished The gates shut on me and turn'd weeping out To beg relief among Rome 's enemies Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears And op'd their arms to embrace me as a friend I am the turned forth be it known to you That have preserv'd her welfare in my blood And from her bosom took the enemy 's point Sheathing the steel in my advent'rous body Alas you know I am no vaunter I My scars can witness dumb although they are That my report is just and full of truth But soft methinks I do digress too much Citing my worthless praise O pardon me For when no friends are by men praise themselves Now is my turn to speak Behold the child Come come thou reverend man of Rome And bring our Emperor gently in thy hand Lucius our Emperor for well I know The common voice do cry it shall be so Lucius all hail Rome 's royal Emperor Go go into old Titus ' sorrowful house And hither hale that misbelieving Moor To be adjudg'd some direful slaught'ring death As punishment for his most wicked life Exeunt some Lucius all hail Rome 's gracious governor Thanks gentle Romans May I govern so To heal Rome 's harms and wipe away her woe But gentle people give me aim awhile For nature puts me to a heavy task Stand all aloof but uncle draw you near To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk O take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips Kisses TITUS These sorrowful drops upon thy blood stain'd face The last true duties of thy noble son Tear for tear and loving kiss for kiss Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips O were the sum of these that I should pay Countless and infinite yet would I pay them Come hither boy come come come and learn of us To melt in showers Thy grandsire lov'd thee well Many a time he danc'd thee on his knee Sung thee asleep his loving breast thy pillow Many a story hath he told to thee And bid thee bear his pretty tales in mind And talk of them when he was dead and gone How many thousand times hath these poor lips When they were living warm'd themselves on thine O now sweet boy give them their latest kiss Bid him farewell commit him to the grave Do them that kindness and take leave of them O grandsire grandsire ev'n with all my heart Would I were dead so you did live again O Lord I can not speak to him for weeping My tears will choke me if I ope my mouth You sad Andronici have done with woes Give sentence on the execrable wretch That hath been breeder of these dire events Set him breast deep in earth and famish him There let him stand and rave and cry for food If any one relieves or pities him For the offence he dies This is our doom Some stay to see him fast'ned in the earth Ah why should wrath be mute and fury dumb I am no baby I that with base prayers I should repent the evils I have done Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did Would I perform if I might have my will If one good deed in all my life I did I do repent it from my very soul Some loving friends convey the Emperor hence And give him burial in his father 's grave My father and Lavinia shall forthwith Be closed in our household 's monument As for that ravenous tiger Tamora No funeral rite nor man in mourning weed No mournful bell shall ring her burial But throw her forth to beasts and birds to prey Her life was beastly and devoid of pity And being dead let birds on her take pity Exeunt Call here my varlet I 'll unarm again Why should I war without the walls of Troy That find such cruel battle here within Each Troyan that is master of his heart Let him to field Troilus alas hath none Will this gear ne'er be mended The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant But I am weaker than a woman 's tear Tamer than sleep fonder than ignorance Less valiant than the virgin in the night And skilless as unpractis'd infancy Well I have told you enough of this for my part I 'll not meddle nor make no farther He that will have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding Have I not tarried Ay the grinding but you must tarry the bolting Have I not tarried Ay the bolting but you must tarry the leavening Still have I tarried Ay to the leavening but here 's yet in the word ' hereafter ' the kneading the making of the cake the heating of the oven and the baking nay you must stay the cooling too or you may chance to burn your lips Patience herself what goddess e'er she be Doth lesser blench at suff'rance than I do At Priam 's royal table do I sit And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts- So traitor then she comes when she is thence Well she look'd yesternight fairer than ever I saw her look or any woman else I was about to tell thee when my heart As wedged with a sigh would rive in twain Lest Hector or my father should perceive me I have as when the sun doth light a storm Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile But sorrow that is couch'd in seeming gladness Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's- well go to- there were no more comparison between the women But for my part she is my kinswoman I would not as they term it praise her but I would somebody had heard her talk yesterday as I did I will not dispraise your sister Cassandra 's wit but- O Pandarus I tell thee Pandarus- When I do tell thee there my hopes lie drown'd Reply not in how many fathoms deep They lie indrench'd I tell thee I am mad In Cressid 's love Thou answer'st ' She is fair'- Pourest in the open ulcer of my heart- Her eyes her hair her cheek her gait her voice Handlest in thy discourse O that her hand In whose comparison all whites are ink Writing their own reproach to whose soft seizure The cygnet 's down is harsh and spirit of sense Hard as the palm of ploughman This thou tell'st me As true thou tell'st me when I say I love her But saying thus instead of oil and balm Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me The knife that made it I speak no more than truth Thou dost not speak so much Faith I 'll not meddle in it Let her be as she is if she be fair ' tis the better for her an she be not she has the mends in her own hands Good Pandarus How now Pandarus I have had my labour for my travail ill thought on of her and ill thought on of you gone between and between but small thanks for my labour What art thou angry Pandarus What with me Because she 's kin to me therefore she 's not so fair as Helen An she were not kin to me she would be as fair a Friday as Helen is on Sunday But what care I I care not an she were a blackamoor ' tis all one to me Say I she is not fair I do not care whether you do or no She 's a fool to stay behind her father Let her to the Greeks and so I 'll tell her the next time I see her For my part I 'll meddle nor make no more i ' th ' matter Pandarus Not I. Sweet Pandarus Pray you speak no more to me I will leave all as I found it and there an end Exit Sound alarum Peace you ungracious clamours Peace rude sounds Fools on both sides Helen must needs be fair When with your blood you daily paint her thus I can not fight upon this argument It is too starv'd a subject for my sword But Pandarus O gods how do you plague me I can not come to Cressid but by Pandar And he 's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo As she is stubborn chaste against all suit Tell me Apollo for thy Daphne 's love What Cressid is what Pandar and what we Her bed is India there she lies a pearl Between our Ilium and where she resides Let it be call'd the wild and wand'ring flood Ourself the merchant and this sailing Pandar Our doubtful hope our convoy and our bark How now Prince Troilus Wherefore not afield Because not there This woman 's answer sorts For womanish it is to be from thence What news Aeneas from the field to day That Paris is returned home and hurt By whom Aeneas Troilus by Menelaus Let Paris bleed ' tis but a scar to scorn Paris is gor'd with Menelaus ' horn Alarum Hark what good sport is out of town to day Better at home if ' would I might ' were ' may ' But to the sport abroad Are you bound thither In all swift haste Come go we then together Exeunt Who were those went by Queen Hecuba and Helen And whither go they Up to the eastern tower Whose height commands as subject all the vale To see the battle Hector whose patience Is as a virtue fix'd to day was mov'd He chid Andromache and struck his armourer And like as there were husbandry in war Before the sun rose he was harness'd light And to the field goes he where every flower Did as a prophet weep what it foresaw In Hector 's wrath What was his cause of anger The noise goes this there is among the Greeks A lord of Troyan blood nephew to Hector They call him Ajax Good and what of him They say he is a very man per se And stands alone So do all men unless they are drunk sick or have no legs This man lady hath robb'd many beasts of their particular additions he is as valiant as a lion churlish as the bear slow as the elephant a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crush'd into folly his folly sauced with discretion There is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty Briareus many hands and no use or purblind Argus all eyes and no sight But how should this man that makes me smile make Hector They say he yesterday cop'd Hector in the battle and struck him down the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept Hector fasting and waking Who comes here Madam your uncle Pandarus Hector 's a gallant man As may be in the world lady What 's that What 's that Good morrow uncle Pandarus Good morrow cousin Cressid What do you talk of?- Good morrow Alexander.-How do you cousin When were you at Ilium This morning uncle What were you talking of when I came Was Hector arm'd and gone ere you came to Ilium Helen was not up was she Hector was gone but Helen was not up E'en so Hector was stirring early That were we talking of and of his anger Was he angry So he says here True he was so I know the cause too he 'll lay about him today I can tell them that And there 's Troilus will not come far behind him let them take heed of Troilus I can tell them that too What is he angry too Who Troilus Troilus is the better man of the two O Jupiter there 's no comparison What not between Troilus and Hector Do you know a man if you see him Ay if I ever saw him before and knew him Well I say Troilus is Troilus Then you say as I say for I am sure he is not Hector No nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees ' Tis just to each of them he is himself Himself Alas poor Troilus I would he were So he is Condition I had gone barefoot to India He is not Hector Himself no he 's not himself Would ' a were himself Well the gods are above time must friend or end Well Troilus well I would my heart were in her body No Hector is not a better man than Troilus Excuse me He is elder Pardon me pardon me Th ' other 's not come to't you shall tell me another tale when th ' other 's come to't Hector shall not have his wit this year He shall not need it if he have his own Nor his qualities No matter Nor his beauty ' Twould not become him his own 's better YOU have no judgment niece Helen herself swore th ' other day that Troilus for a brown favour for so ' tis I must confess- not brown neither- No but brown Faith to say truth brown and not brown To say the truth true and not true She prais'd his complexion above Paris Why Paris hath colour enough So he has Then Troilus should have too much If she prais'd him above his complexion is higher than his he having colour enough and the other higher is too flaming praise for a good complexion I had as lief Helen 's golden tongue had commended Troilus for a copper nose I swear to you I think Helen loves him better than Paris Then she 's a merry Greek indeed Nay I am sure she does She came to him th ' other day into the compass'd window and you know he has not past three or four hairs on his chin- Indeed a tapster 's arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total Why he is very young and yet will he within three pound lift as much as his brother Hector Is he so young a man and so old a lifter But to prove to you that Helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin- Juno have mercy How came it cloven Why you know ' tis dimpled I think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia O he smiles valiantly Does he not O yes an ' twere a cloud in autumn Why go to then But to prove to you that Helen loves Troilus- Troilus will stand to the proof if you 'll prove it so Troilus Why he esteems her no more than I esteem an addle egg If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head you would eat chickens i ' th ' shell I can not choose but laugh to think how she tickled his chin Indeed she has a marvell 's white hand I must needs confess Without the rack And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin Alas poor chin Many a wart is richer But there was such laughing Queen Hecuba laugh'd that her eyes ran o'er With millstones And Cassandra laugh'd But there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes Did her eyes run o'er too And Hector laugh'd At what was all this laughing Marry at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus ' chin An't had been a green hair I should have laugh'd too They laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer What was his answer Quoth she ' Here 's but two and fifty hairs on your chin and one of them is white ' This is her question That 's true make no question of that ' Two and fifty hairs ' quoth he ' and one white That white hair is my father and all the rest are his sons ' ' Jupiter ' quoth she ' which of these hairs is Paris my husband ' ' The forked one ' quoth he ' pluck't out and give it him ' But there was such laughing and Helen so blush'd and Paris so chaf'd and all the rest so laugh'd that it pass'd So let it now for it has been a great while going by Well cousin I told you a thing yesterday think on't So I do I 'll be sworn ' tis true he will weep you and ' twere a man born in April And I 'll spring up in his tears an ' twere a nettle against May. Sound a retreat Hark they are coming from the field Shall we stand up here and see them as they pass toward Ilium Good niece do sweet niece Cressida At your pleasure Here here here 's an excellent place here we may see most bravely I 'll tell you them all by their names as they pass by but mark Troilus above the rest Speak not so loud That 's Aeneas Is not that a brave man He 's one of the flowers of Troy I can tell you But mark Troilus you shall see anon Who 's that That 's Antenor He has a shrewd wit I can tell you and he 's a man good enough he 's one o ' th ' soundest judgments in Troy whosoever and a proper man of person When comes Troilus I 'll show you Troilus anon If he see me you shall see him nod at me Will he give you the nod You shall see If he do the rich shall have more That 's Hector that that look you that there 's a fellow Go thy way Hector There 's a brave man niece O brave Hector Look how he looks There 's a countenance Is't not a brave man O a brave man Is ' a not It does a man 's heart good Look you what hacks are on his helmet Look you yonder do you see Look you there There 's no jesting there 's laying on take't off who will as they say There be hacks Be those with swords Swords anything he cares not an the devil come to him it 's all one By God 's lid it does one 's heart good Yonder comes Paris yonder comes Paris Who 's that That 's Helenus I marvel where Troilus is That 's Helenus I think he went not forth to day That 's Helenus Can Helenus fight uncle Helenus no Yes he 'll fight indifferent well I marvel where Troilus is Hark do you not hear the people cry ' Troilus ' Helenus is a priest What sneaking fellow comes yonder Where yonder That 's Deiphobus ' Tis Troilus There 's a man niece Hem Brave Troilus the prince of chivalry Peace for shame peace Mark him note him O brave Troilus Look well upon him niece look you how his sword is bloodied and his helm more hack'd than Hector 's and how he looks and how he goes O admirable youth he never saw three and twenty Go thy way Troilus go thy way Had I a sister were a grace or a daughter a goddess he should take his choice O admirable man Paris Paris is dirt to him and I warrant Helen to change would give an eye to boot Here comes more Asses fools dolts chaff and bran chaff and bran porridge after meat I could live and die in the eyes of Troilus Ne'er look ne'er look the eagles are gone Crows and daws crows and daws I had rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and all Greece There is amongst the Greeks Achilles a better man than Troilus Achilles A drayman a porter a very camel Well well Well well Why have you any discretion Have you any eyes Do you know what a man is Is not birth beauty good shape discourse manhood learning gentleness virtue youth liberality and such like the spice and salt that season a man Ay a minc'd man and then to be bak'd with no date in the pie for then the man 's date is out You are such a woman A man knows not at what ward you lie Upon my back to defend my belly upon my wit to defend my wiles upon my secrecy to defend mine honesty my mask to defend my beauty and you to defend all these and at all these wards I lie at at a thousand watches Say one of your watches Nay I 'll watch you for that and that 's one of the chiefest of them too If I can not ward what I would not have hit I can watch you for telling how I took the blow unless it swell past hiding and then it 's past watching You are such another Sir my lord would instantly speak with you Where At your own house there he unarms him Good boy tell him I come Exit Boy I doubt he be hurt Fare ye well good niece Adieu uncle I will be with you niece by and by To bring uncle Ay a token from Troilus By the same token you are a bawd Princes What grief hath set these jaundies o'er your cheeks The ample proposition that hope makes In all designs begun on earth below Fails in the promis'd largeness checks and disasters Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd As knots by the conflux of meeting sap Infects the sound pine and diverts his grain Tortive and errant from his course of growth Nor princes is it matter new to us That we come short of our suppose so far That after seven years ' siege yet Troy walls stand Sith every action that hath gone before Whereof we have record trial did draw Bias and thwart not answering the aim And that unbodied figure of the thought That gave't surmised shape Why then you princes Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works And call them shames which are indeed nought else But the protractive trials of great Jove To find persistive constancy in men The fineness of which metal is not found In fortune 's love For then the bold and coward The wise and fool the artist and unread The hard and soft seem all affin'd and kin But in the wind and tempest of her frown Distinction with a broad and powerful fan Puffing at all winnows the light away And what hath mass or matter by itself Lies rich in virtue and unmingled With due observance of thy godlike seat Great Agamemnon Nestor shall apply Thy latest words In the reproof of chance Lies the true proof of men The sea being smooth How many shallow bauble boats dare sail Upon her patient breast making their way With those of nobler bulk But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage The gentle Thetis and anon behold The strong ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut Bounding between the two moist elements Like Perseus ' horse Where 's then the saucy boat Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now Co rivall'd greatness Either to harbour fled Or made a toast for Neptune Even so Doth valour 's show and valour 's worth divide In storms of fortune for in her ray and brightness The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze Than by the tiger but when the splitting wind Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks And flies fled under shade why then the thing of courage As rous'd with rage with rage doth sympathise And with an accent tun'd in self same key Retorts to chiding fortune Agamemnon Thou great commander nerve and bone of Greece Heart of our numbers soul and only spirit In whom the tempers and the minds of all Should be shut up hear what Ulysses speaks Besides the applause and approbation The which To AGAMEMNON most mighty for thy place and sway To NESTOR And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd out life I give to both your speeches- which were such As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece Should hold up high in brass and such again As venerable Nestor hatch'd in silver Should with a bond of air strong as the axle tree On which heaven rides knit all the Greekish ears To his experienc'd tongue yet let it please both Thou great and wise to hear Ulysses speak Speak Prince of Ithaca and be't of less expect That matter needless of importless burden Divide thy lips than we are confident When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws We shall hear music wit and oracle Troy yet upon his basis had been down And the great Hector 's sword had lack'd a master But for these instances The specialty of rule hath been neglected And look how many Grecian tents do stand Hollow upon this plain so many hollow factions When that the general is not like the hive To whom the foragers shall all repair What honey is expected Degree being vizarded Th ' unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask The heavens themselves the planets and this centre Observe degree priority and place Insisture course proportion season form Office and custom in all line of order And therefore is the glorious planet Sol In noble eminence enthron'd and spher'd Amidst the other whose med'cinable eye Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil And posts like the commandment of a king Sans check to good and bad But when the planets In evil mixture to disorder wander What plagues and what portents what mutiny What raging of the sea shaking of earth Commotion in the winds Frights changes horrors Divert and crack rend and deracinate The unity and married calm of states Quite from their fixture O when degree is shak'd Which is the ladder of all high designs The enterprise is sick How could communities Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities Peaceful commerce from dividable shores The primogenity and due of birth Prerogative of age crowns sceptres laurels But by degree stand in authentic place Take but degree away untune that string And hark what discord follows Each thing melts In mere oppugnancy the bounded waters Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores And make a sop of all this solid globe Strength should be lord of imbecility And the rude son should strike his father dead Force should be right or rather right and wrong- Between whose endless jar justice resides- Should lose their names and so should justice too Then everything includes itself in power Power into will will into appetite And appetite an universal wolf So doubly seconded with will and power Must make perforce an universal prey And last eat up himself Great Agamemnon This chaos when degree is suffocate Follows the choking And this neglection of degree it is That by a pace goes backward with a purpose It hath to climb The general 's disdain'd By him one step below he by the next That next by him beneath so ever step Exampl'd by the first pace that is sick Of his superior grows to an envious fever Of pale and bloodless emulation And ' tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot Not her own sinews To end a tale of length Troy in our weakness stands not in her strength Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd The fever whereof all our power is sick The nature of the sickness found Ulysses What is the remedy The great Achilles whom opinion crowns The sinew and the forehand of our host Having his ear full of his airy fame Grows dainty of his worth and in his tent Lies mocking our designs with him Patroclus Upon a lazy bed the livelong day Breaks scurril jests And with ridiculous and awkward action- Which slanderer he imitation calls- He pageants us Sometime great Agamemnon Thy topless deputation he puts on And like a strutting player whose conceit Lies in his hamstring and doth think it rich To hear the wooden dialogue and sound ' Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage- Such to be pitied and o'er wrested seeming He acts thy greatness in and when he speaks ' Tis like a chime a mending with terms unsquar'd Which from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd Would seem hyperboles At this fusty stuff The large Achilles on his press'd bed lolling From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause Cries ' Excellent ' tis Agamemnon just Now play me Nestor hem and stroke thy beard As he being drest to some oration ' That 's done as near as the extremest ends Of parallels as like Vulcan and his wife Yet god Achilles still cries ' Excellent ' Tis Nestor right Now play him me Patroclus Arming to answer in a night alarm ' And then forsooth the faint defects of age Must be the scene of mirth to cough and spit And with a palsy fumbling on his gorget Shake in and out the rivet And at this sport Sir Valour dies cries ' O enough Patroclus Or give me ribs of steel I shall split all In pleasure of my spleen ' And in this fashion All our abilities gifts natures shapes Severals and generals of grace exact Achievements plots orders preventions Excitements to the field or speech for truce Success or loss what is or is not serves As stuff for these two to make paradoxes And in the imitation of these twain- Who as Ulysses says opinion crowns With an imperial voice many are infect Ajax is grown self will'd and bears his head In such a rein in full as proud a place As broad Achilles keeps his tent like him Makes factious feasts rails on our state of war Bold as an oracle and sets Thersites A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint To match us in comparisons with dirt To weaken and discredit our exposure How rank soever rounded in with danger They tax our policy and call it cowardice Count wisdom as no member of the war Forestall prescience and esteem no act But that of hand The still and mental parts That do contrive how many hands shall strike When fitness calls them on and know by measure Of their observant toil the enemies ' weight- Why this hath not a finger 's dignity They call this bed work mapp'ry closet war So that the ram that batters down the wall For the great swinge and rudeness of his poise They place before his hand that made the engine Or those that with the fineness of their souls By reason guide his execution Let this be granted and Achilles ' horse Makes many Thetis ' sons Tucket What trumpet Look Menelaus From Troy What would you fore our tent Is this great Agamemnon 's tent I pray you Even this May one that is a herald and a prince Do a fair message to his kingly eyes With surety stronger than Achilles ' an Fore all the Greekish heads which with one voice Call Agamemnon head and general Fair leave and large security How may A stranger to those most imperial looks Know them from eyes of other mortals How Ay I ask that I might waken reverence And bid the cheek be ready with a blush Modest as Morning when she coldly eyes The youthful Phoebus Which is that god in office guiding men Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon This Troyan scorns us or the men of Troy Are ceremonious courtiers Courtiers as free as debonair unarm'd As bending angels that 's their fame in peace But when they would seem soldiers they have galls Good arms strong joints true swords and Jove 's accord Nothing so full of heart But peace Aeneas Peace Troyan lay thy finger on thy lips The worthiness of praise distains his worth If that the prais'd himself bring the praise forth But what the repining enemy commends That breath fame blows that praise sole pure transcends Sir you of Troy call you yourself Aeneas Ay Greek that is my name What 's your affair I pray you Sir pardon ' tis for Agamemnon 's ears He hears nought privately that comes from Troy Nor I from Troy come not to whisper with him I bring a trumpet to awake his ear To set his sense on the attentive bent And then to speak Speak frankly as the wind It is not Agamemnon 's sleeping hour That thou shalt know Troyan he is awake He tells thee so himself Trumpet blow loud Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents And every Greek of mettle let him know What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud This shall be told our lovers Lord Aeneas If none of them have soul in such a kind We left them all at home But we are soldiers And may that soldier a mere recreant prove That means not hath not or is not in love If then one is or hath or means to be That one meets Hector if none else I am he Tell him of Nestor one that was a man When Hector 's grandsire suck'd He is old now But if there be not in our Grecian mould One noble man that hath one spark of fire To answer for his love tell him from me I 'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn And meeting him will tell him that my lady Was fairer than his grandame and as chaste As may be in the world His youth in flood I 'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood Now heavens forfend such scarcity of youth Amen Fair Lord Aeneas let me touch your hand To our pavilion shall I lead you first Achilles shall have word of this intent So shall each lord of Greece from tent to tent Yourself shall feast with us before you go And find the welcome of a noble foe Nestor What says Ulysses I have a young conception in my brain Be you my time to bring it to some shape What is't This ' tis Blunt wedges rive hard knots The seeded pride That hath to this maturity blown up In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd Or shedding breed a nursery of like evil To overbulk us all Well and how This challenge that the gallant Hector sends However it is spread in general name Relates in purpose only to Achilles True The purpose is perspicuous even as substance Whose grossness little characters sum up And in the publication make no strain But that Achilles were his brain as barren As banks of Libya though Apollo knows ' Tis dry enough will with great speed of judgment Ay with celerity find Hector 's purpose Pointing on him And wake him to the answer think you Why ' tis most meet Who may you else oppose That can from Hector bring those honours off If not Achilles Though ' t be a sportful combat Yet in this trial much opinion dwells For here the Troyans taste our dear'st repute With their fin'st palate and trust to me Ulysses Our imputation shall be oddly pois'd In this vile action for the success Although particular shall give a scantling Of good or bad unto the general And in such indexes although small pricks To their subsequent volumes there is seen The baby figure of the giant mas Of things to come at large It is suppos'd He that meets Hector issues from our choice And choice being mutual act of all our souls Makes merit her election and doth boil As ' twere from forth us all a man distill'd Out of our virtues who miscarrying What heart receives from hence a conquering part To steel a strong opinion to themselves Which entertain'd limbs are his instruments In no less working than are swords and bows Directive by the limbs Give pardon to my speech Therefore ' tis meet Achilles meet not Hector Let us like merchants show our foulest wares And think perchance they 'll sell if not the lustre Of the better yet to show shall show the better By showing the worst first Do not consent That ever Hector and Achilles meet For both our honour and our shame in this Are dogg'd with two strange followers I see them not with my old eyes What are they What glory our Achilles shares from Hector Were he not proud we all should wear with him But he already is too insolent And it were better parch in Afric sun Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes Should he scape Hector fair If he were foil'd Why then we do our main opinion crush In taint of our best man No make a lott'ry And by device let blockish Ajax draw The sort to fight with Hector Among ourselves Give him allowance for the better man For that will physic the great Myrmidon Who broils in loud applause and make him fall His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off We 'll dress him up in voices if he fail Yet go we under our opinion still That we have better men But hit or miss Our project 's life this shape of sense assumes- Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles ' plumes Now Ulysses I begin to relish thy advice And I will give a taste thereof forthwith To Agamemnon Go we to him straight Two curs shall tame each other pride alone Must tarre the mastiffs on as ' twere their bone Exeunt Thersites Agamemnon how if he had boils full an over generally Thersites And those boils did run say so Did not the general run then Were not that a botchy core Dog Then there would come some matter from him I see none now Thou bitch wolf 's son canst thou not hear Feel then The plague of Greece upon thee thou mongrel beef witted lord Speak then thou whinid'st leaven speak I will beat thee into handsomeness I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but I think thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book Thou canst strike canst thou A red murrain o ' thy jade 's tricks Toadstool learn me the proclamation Dost thou think I have no sense thou strikest me thus The proclamation Thou art proclaim'd a fool I think Do not porpentine do not my fingers itch I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had the scratching of thee I would make thee the loathsomest scab in Greece When thou art forth in the incursions thou strikest as slow as another I say the proclamation Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as Cerberus is at Proserpina 's beauty ay that thou bark'st at him Mistress Thersites Thou shouldst strike him Cobloaf He would pun thee into shivers with his fist as a sailor breaks a biscuit You whoreson cur Strikes him Do do Thou stool for a witch Ay do do thou sodden witted lord Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows an assinico may tutor thee You scurvy valiant ass Thou art here but to thrash Troyans and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit like a barbarian slave If thou use to beat me I will begin at thy heel and tell what thou art by inches thou thing of no bowels thou You dog You scurvy lord You cur Strikes him Mars his idiot Do rudeness do camel do do Why how now Ajax Wherefore do you thus How now Thersites What 's the matter man You see him there do you Ay what 's the matter Nay look upon him So I do What 's the matter Nay but regard him well Well why so I do But yet you look not well upon him for who some ever you take him to be he is Ajax I know that fool Ay but that fool knows not himself Therefore I beat thee Lo lo lo lo what modicums of wit he utters His evasions have ears thus long I have bobb'd his brain more than he has beat my bones I will buy nine sparrows for a penny and his pia mater is not worth the ninth part of a sparrow This lord Achilles Ajax who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head I'll tell you what I say of him What I say this Ajax- AJAX offers to strike him Nay good Ajax Has not so much wit- Nay I must hold you As will stop the eye of Helen 's needle for whom he comes to fight Peace fool I would have peace and quietness but the fool will not- he there that he look you there O thou damned cur I shall- Will you set your wit to a fool 's No I warrant you the fool 's will shame it Good words Thersites What 's the quarrel I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenour of the proclamation and he rails upon me I serve thee not Well go to go to I serve here voluntary Your last service was suff'rance ' twas not voluntary No man is beaten voluntary Ajax was here the voluntary and you as under an impress E'en so a great deal of your wit too lies in your sinews or else there be liars Hector shall have a great catch an he knock out either of your brains ' a were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel What with me too Thersites There 's Ulysses and old Nestor whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes yoke you like draught oxen and make you plough up the wars What what Yes good sooth To Achilles to Ajax to- I shall cut out your tongue ' Tis no matter I shall speak as much as thou afterwards No more words Thersites peace I will hold my peace when Achilles ' brach bids me shall I There 's for you Patroclus I will see you hang'd like clotpoles ere I come any more to your tents I will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools Exit A good riddance Marry this sir is proclaim'd through all our host That Hector by the fifth hour of the sun Will with a trumpet ' twixt our tents and Troy To morrow morning call some knight to arms That hath a stomach and such a one that dare Maintain I know not what ' tis trash Farewell Farewell Who shall answer him I know not ' tis put to lott'ry Otherwise He knew his man O meaning you I will go learn more of it Exeunt After so many hours lives speeches spent Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks ' Deliver Helen and all damage else- As honour loss of time travail expense Wounds friends and what else dear that is consum'd In hot digestion of this cormorant war- Shall be struck off ' Hector what say you to't Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I As far as toucheth my particular Yet dread Priam There is no lady of more softer bowels More spongy to suck in the sense of fear More ready to cry out ' Who knows what follows ' Than Hector is The wound of peace is surety Surety secure but modest doubt is call'd The beacon of the wise the tent that searches To th ' bottom of the worst Let Helen go Since the first sword was drawn about this question Every tithe soul ' mongst many thousand dismes Hath been as dear as Helen I mean of ours If we have lost so many tenths of ours To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us Had it our name the value of one ten What merit 's in that reason which denies The yielding of her up Fie fie my brother Weigh you the worth and honour of a king So great as our dread father 's in a scale Of common ounces Will you with counters sum The past proportion of his infinite And buckle in a waist most fathomless With spans and inches so diminutive As fears and reasons Fie for godly shame No marvel though you bite so sharp at reasons You are so empty of them Should not our father Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons Because your speech hath none that tells him so You are for dreams and slumbers brother priest You fur your gloves with reason Here are your reasons You know an enemy intends you harm You know a sword employ'd is perilous And reason flies the object of all harm Who marvels then when Helenus beholds A Grecian and his sword if he do set The very wings of reason to his heels And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove Or like a star disorb'd Nay if we talk of reason Let 's shut our gates and sleep Manhood and honour Should have hare hearts would they but fat their thoughts With this cramm'd reason Reason and respect Make livers pale and lustihood deject Brother she is not worth what she doth cost The keeping What 's aught but as ' tis valued But value dwells not in particular will It holds his estimate and dignity As well wherein ' tis precious of itself As in the prizer ' Tis mad idolatry To make the service greater than the god I And the will dotes that is attributive To what infectiously itself affects Without some image of th ' affected merit I take to day a wife and my election Is led on in the conduct of my will My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears Two traded pilots ' twixt the dangerous shores Of will and judgment how may I avoid Although my will distaste what it elected The wife I chose There can be no evasion To blench from this and to stand firm by honour We turn not back the silks upon the merchant When we have soil'd them nor the remainder viands We do not throw in unrespective sieve Because we now are full It was thought meet Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks Your breath with full consent benied his sails The seas and winds old wranglers took a truce And did him service He touch'd the ports desir'd And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness Wrinkles Apollo 's and makes stale the morning Why keep we her The Grecians keep our aunt Is she worth keeping Why she is a pearl Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants If you 'll avouch ' twas wisdom Paris went- As you must needs for you all cried ' Go go'- If you 'll confess he brought home worthy prize- As you must needs for you all clapp'd your hands And cried ' Inestimable ' -why do you now The issue of your proper wisdoms rate And do a deed that never fortune did- Beggar the estimation which you priz'd Richer than sea and land O theft most base That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep But thieves unworthy of a thing so stol'n That in their country did them that disgrace We fear to warrant in our native place Within Cry Troyans cry What noise what shriek is this ' Tis our mad sister I do know her voice Within Cry Troyans It is Cassandra Cry Troyans cry Lend me ten thousand eyes And I will fill them with prophetic tears Peace sister peace Virgins and boys mid age and wrinkled eld Soft infancy that nothing canst but cry Add to my clamours Let us pay betimes A moiety of that mass of moan to come Cry Troyans cry Practise your eyes with tears Troy must not be nor goodly Ilion stand Our firebrand brother Paris burns us all Cry Troyans cry A Helen and a woe Cry cry Troy burns or else let Helen go Exit Now youthful Troilus do not these high strains Of divination in our sister work Some touches of remorse or is your blood So madly hot that no discourse of reason Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause Can qualify the same Why brother Hector We may not think the justness of each act Such and no other than event doth form it Nor once deject the courage of our minds Because Cassandra 's mad Her brain sick raptures Can not distaste the goodness of a quarrel Which hath our several honours all engag'd To make it gracious For my private part I am no more touch'd than all Priam 's sons And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us Such things as might offend the weakest spleen To fight for and maintain Else might the world convince of levity As well my undertakings as your counsels But I attest the gods your full consent Gave wings to my propension and cut of All fears attending on so dire a project For what alas can these my single arms What propugnation is in one man 's valour To stand the push and enmity of those This quarrel would excite Yet I protest Were I alone to pass the difficulties And had as ample power as I have will Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done Nor faint in the pursuit Paris you speak Like one besotted on your sweet delights You have the honey still but these the gall So to be valiant is no praise at all Sir I propose not merely to myself The pleasures such a beauty brings with it But I would have the soil of her fair rape Wip'd off in honourable keeping her What treason were it to the ransack'd queen Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me Now to deliver her possession up On terms of base compulsion Can it be That so degenerate a strain as this Should once set footing in your generous bosoms There 's not the meanest spirit on our party Without a heart to dare or sword to draw When Helen is defended nor none so noble Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfam'd Where Helen is the subject Then I say Well may we fight for her whom we know well The world 's large spaces can not parallel Paris and Troilus you have both said well And on the cause and question now in hand Have gloz'd but superficially not much Unlike young men whom Aristode thought Unfit to hear moral philosophy The reasons you allege do more conduce To the hot passion of distemp'red blood Than to make up a free determination ' Twixt right and wrong for pleasure and revenge Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice Of any true decision Nature craves All dues be rend'red to their owners Now What nearer debt in all humanity Than wife is to the husband If this law Of nature be corrupted through affection And that great minds of partial indulgence To their benumbed wills resist the same There is a law in each well order'd nation To curb those raging appetites that are Most disobedient and refractory If Helen then be wife to Sparta 's king- As it is known she is these moral laws Of nature and of nations speak aloud To have her back return'd Thus to persist In doing wrong extenuates not wrong But makes it much more heavy Hector 's opinion Is this in way of truth Yet ne'er the less My spritely brethren I propend to you In resolution to keep Helen still For ' tis a cause that hath no mean dependence Upon our joint and several dignities Why there you touch'd the life of our design Were it not glory that we more affected Than the performance of our heaving spleens I would not wish a drop of Troyan blood Spent more in her defence But worthy Hector She is a theme of honour and renown A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds Whose present courage may beat down our foes And fame in time to come canonize us For I presume brave Hector would not lose So rich advantage of a promis'd glory As smiles upon the forehead of this action For the wide world 's revenue I am yours You valiant offspring of great Priamus I have a roisting challenge sent amongst The dull and factious nobles of the Greeks Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits I was advertis'd their great general slept Whilst emulation in the army crept This I presume will wake him Exeunt How now Thersites What lost in the labyrinth of thy fury Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus He beats me and I rail at him O worthy satisfaction Would it were otherwise that I could beat him whilst he rail'd at me ' Sfoot I 'll learn to conjure and raise devils but I 'll see some issue of my spiteful execrations Then there 's Achilles a rare engineer If Troy be not taken till these two undermine it the walls will stand till they fall of themselves O thou great thunder darter of Olympus forget that thou art Jove the king of gods and Mercury lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus if ye take not that little little less than little wit from them that they have which short arm'd ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web After this the vengeance on the whole camp or rather the Neapolitan bone ache for that methinks is the curse depending on those that war for a placket I have said my prayers and devil Envy say ' Amen ' What ho my Lord Achilles Who 's there Thersites Good Thersites come in and rail If I could ' a rememb'red a gilt counterfeit thou wouldst not have slipp'd out of my contemplation but it is no matter thyself upon thyself The common curse of mankind folly and ignorance be thine in great revenue Heaven bless thee from a tutor and discipline come not near thee Let thy blood be thy direction till thy death Then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse I 'll be sworn and sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars Amen Where 's Achilles What art thou devout Wast thou in prayer Ay the heavens hear me Amen Who 's there Thersites my lord Where where O where Art thou come Why my cheese my digestion why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals Come what 's Agamemnon Thy commander Achilles Then tell me Patroclus what 's Achilles Thy lord Thersites Then tell me I pray thee what 's Thersites Thy knower Patroclus Then tell me Patroclus what art thou Thou must tell that knowest O tell tell I 'll decline the whole question Agamemnon commands Achilles Achilles is my lord I am Patroclus ' knower and Patroclus is a fool You rascal Peace fool I have not done He is a privileg'd man Proceed Thersites Agamemnon is a fool Achilles is a fool Thersites is a fool and as aforesaid Patroclus is a fool Derive this come Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool and this Patroclus is a fool positive Why am I a fool Make that demand of the Creator It suffices me thou art Look you who comes here Come Patroclus I 'll speak with nobody Come in with me Thersites Exit Here is such patchery such juggling and such knavery All the argument is a whore and a cuckold a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon Now the dry serpigo on the subject and war and lechery confound all Exit Where is Achilles Within his tent but ill dispos'd my lord Let it be known to him that we are here He shent our messengers and we lay by Our appertainings visiting of him Let him be told so lest perchance he think We dare not move the question of our place Or know not what we are I shall say so to him Exit We saw him at the opening of his tent He is not sick Yes lion sick sick of proud heart You may call it melancholy if you will favour the man but by my head ' tis pride But why why Let him show us a cause A word my lord What moves Ajax thus to bay at him Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him Who Thersites He Then will Ajax lack matter if he have lost his argument No you see he is his argument that has his argument- Achilles All the better their fraction is more our wish than their faction But it was a strong composure a fool could disunite The amity that wisdom knits not folly may easily untie No Achilles with him The elephant hath joints but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity not for flexure Achilles bids me say he is much sorry If any thing more than your sport and pleasure Did move your greatness and this noble state To call upon him he hopes it is no other But for your health and your digestion sake An after dinner 's breath Hear you Patroclus We are too well acquainted with these answers But his evasion wing'd thus swift with scorn Can not outfly our apprehensions Much attribute he hath and much the reason Why we ascribe it to him Yet all his virtues Not virtuously on his own part beheld Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss Yea like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish Are like to rot untasted Go and tell him We come to speak with him and you shall not sin If you do say we think him over proud And under honest in self assumption greater Than in the note of judgment and worthier than himself Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on Disguise the holy strength of their command And underwrite in an observing kind His humorous predominance yea watch His pettish lunes his ebbs his flows as if The passage and whole carriage of this action Rode on his tide Go tell him this and ad That if he overhold his price so much We 'll none of him but let him like an engine Not portable lie under this report Bring action hither this can not go to war A stirring dwarf we do allowance give Before a sleeping giant Tell him so I shall and bring his answer presently Exit In second voice we 'll not be satisfied We come to speak with him Ulysses enter you What is he more than another No more than what he thinks he is Is he so much Do you not think he thinks himself a better man than I am No question Will you subscribe his thought and say he is No noble Ajax you are as strong as valiant as wise no less noble much more gentle and altogether more tractable Why should a man be proud How doth pride grow I know not what pride is Your mind is the clearer Ajax and your virtues the fairer He that is proud eats up himself Pride is his own glass his own trumpet his own chronicle and whatever praises itself but in the deed devours the deed in the praise I do hate a proud man as I do hate the engend'ring of toads Aside And yet he loves himself is't not strange Achilles will not to the field to morrow What 's his excuse He doth rely on none But carries on the stream of his dispose Without observance or respect of any In will peculiar and in self admission Why will he not upon our fair request Untent his person and share the air with us Things small as nothing for request 's sake only He makes important possess'd he is with greatness And speaks not to himself but with a pride That quarrels at self breath Imagin'd worth Holds in his blood such swol'n and hot discourse That ' twixt his mental and his active parts Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages And batters down himself What should I say He is so plaguy proud that the death tokens of it Cry ' No recovery ' Let Ajax go to him Dear lord go you and greet him in his tent ' Tis said he holds you well and will be led At your request a little from himself O Agamemnon let it not be so We 'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes When they go from Achilles Shall the proud lord That bastes his arrogance with his own seam And never suffers matter of the world Enter his thoughts save such as doth revolve And ruminate himself shall he be worshipp'd Of that we hold an idol more than he No this thrice worthy and right valiant lord Shall not so stale his palm nobly acquir'd Nor by my will assubjugate his merit As amply titled as Achilles is By going to Achilles That were to enlard his fat already pride And add more coals to Cancer when he burns With entertaining great Hyperion This lord go to him Jupiter forbid And say in thunder ' Achilles go to him ' Aside O this is well He rubs the vein of him Aside And how his silence drinks up this applause If I go to him with my armed fist I 'll pash him o'er the face O no you shall not go An ' a be proud with me I 'll pheeze his pride Let me go to him Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel A paltry insolent fellow Aside How he describes himself Can he not be sociable Aside The raven chides blackness I 'll let his humours blood Aside He will be the physician that should be the patient An all men were a my mind- Aside Wit would be out of fashion ' A should not bear it so ' a should eat 's words first Shall pride carry it Aside An ' twould you 'd carry half Aside ' A would have ten shares I will knead him I 'll make him supple Aside He 's not yet through warm Force him with praises pour in pour in his ambition is dry To AGAMEMNON My lord you feed too much on this dislike Our noble general do not do so You must prepare to fight without Achilles Why ' tis this naming of him does him harm Here is a man but ' tis before his face I will be silent Wherefore should you so He is not emulous as Achilles is Know the whole world he is as valiant A whoreson dog that shall palter with us thus Would he were a Troyan What a vice were it in Ajax now- If he were proud Or covetous of praise Ay or surly borne Or strange or self affected Thank the heavens lord thou art of sweet composure Praise him that gat thee she that gave thee suck Fam'd be thy tutor and thy parts of nature Thrice fam'd beyond beyond all erudition But he that disciplin'd thine arms to fight- Let Mars divide eternity in twain And give him half and for thy vigour Bull bearing Milo his addition yield To sinewy Ajax I will not praise thy wisdom Which like a bourn a pale a shore confines Thy spacious and dilated parts Here 's Nestor Instructed by the antiquary times- He must he is he can not but be wise But pardon father Nestor were your days As green as Ajax ' and your brain so temper'd You should not have the eminence of him But be as Ajax Shall I call you father Ay my good son Be rul'd by him Lord Ajax There is no tarrying here the hart Achilles Keeps thicket Please it our great general To call together all his state of war Fresh kings are come to Troy To morrow We must with all our main of power stand fast And here 's a lord come knights from east to west And cull their flower Ajax shall cope the best Go we to council Let Achilles sleep Light boats sail swift though greater hulks draw deep Exeunt Friend you pray you a word Do you not follow the young Lord Paris Ay sir when he goes before me You depend upon him I mean Sir I do depend upon the lord You depend upon a notable gentleman I must needs praise him The lord be praised You know me do you not Faith sir superficially Friend know me better I am the Lord Pandarus I hope I shall know your honour better I do desire it You are in the state of grace Grace Not so friend honour and lordship are my titles What music is this I do but partly know sir it is

Fair be to you my lord and to all this fair company Fair desires in all fair measure fairly guide them- especially to you fair queen Fair thoughts be your fair pillow Dear lord you are full of fair words You speak your fair pleasure sweet queen Fair prince here is good broken music You have broke it cousin and by my life you shall make it whole again you shall piece it out with a piece of your performance He is full of harmony Truly lady no O sir- Rude in sooth in good sooth very rude Well said my lord Well you say so in fits I have business to my lord dear queen My lord will you vouchsafe

My Lord Pandarus honey sweet lord- Go to sweet queen go to commends himself most affectionately to you- You shall not bob us out of our melody If you do our melancholy upon your head Sweet queen sweet queen that 's a sweet queen i ' faith And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence Nay that shall not serve your turn that shall it not in truth la Nay I care not for such words no no -And my lord he desires you that if the King call for him at supper you will make his excuse My Lord Pandarus What says my sweet queen my very very sweet queen What exploit 's in hand Where sups he to night Nay but my lord- What says my sweet queen?-My cousin will fall out with you You must not know where he sups I 'll lay my life with my disposer Cressida No no no such matter you are wide Come your disposer

done My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have sweet queen She shall have it my lord if it be not my Lord Paris He No she 'll none of him they two are twain Falling in after falling out may make them three Come come I 'll hear no more of this I 'll sing you a song now Ay ay prithee now By my troth sweet lord thou hast a fine forehead Ay you may you may Let thy song be love This love will undo us all O Cupid Cupid Cupid Love Ay that it shall i ' faith Ay good now love love nothing but love In good troth it begins so Sings In love i ' faith to the very tip of the nose He eats nothing but doves love and that breeds hot blood and hot blood begets hot thoughts and hot thoughts beget hot deeds and hot deeds is love Is this the generation of love hot blood hot thoughts and hot deeds Why they are vipers Is love a generation of vipers Sweet lord who 's a field today Hector Deiphobus Helenus Antenor and all the gallantry of Troy I would fain have arm'd to day but my Nell would not have it so How chance my brother Troilus went not He hangs the lip at something You know all Lord Pandarus Not I honey sweet queen I long to hear how they spend to day You 'll remember your brother 's excuse To a hair Farewell sweet queen Commend me to your niece I will sweet queen Exit Sound a retreat They 're come from the field Let us to Priam 's hall To greet the warriors Sweet Helen I must woo you To help unarm our Hector His stubborn buckles With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd Shall more obey than to the edge of steel Or force of Greekish sinews you shall do more Than all the island kings disarm great Hector ' Twill make us proud to be his servant Paris Yea what he shall receive of us in duty Gives us more palm in beauty than we have Yea overshines ourself Sweet above thought I love thee Exeunt How now Where 's thy master At my cousin Cressida 's No sir he stays for you to conduct him thither O here he comes How now how now Sirrah walk off Exit Boy Have you seen my cousin No Pandarus I stalk about her door Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks Staying for waftage O be thou my Charon And give me swift transportance to these fields Where I may wallow in the lily beds Propos'd for the deserver O gentle Pandar From Cupid 's shoulder pluck his painted wings And fly with me to Cressid Walk here i ' th ' orchard I 'll bring her straight I am giddy expectation whirls me round Th ' imaginary relish is so sweet That it enchants my sense what will it be When that the wat'ry palate tastes indeed Love 's thrice repured nectar Death I fear me Swooning destruction or some joy too fine Too subtle potent tun'd too sharp in sweetness For the capacity of my ruder powers I fear it much and I do fear besides That I shall lose distinction in my joys As doth a battle when they charge on heaps The enemy flying She 's making her ready she 'll come straight you must be witty now She does so blush and fetches her wind so short as if she were fray'd with a sprite I 'll fetch her It is the prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a new ta'en sparrow Exit Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse And all my powers do their bestowing lose Like vassalage at unawares encount'ring The eye of majesty Come come what need you blush Shame 's a baby.-Here she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me.- What are you gone again You must be watch'd ere you be made tame must you Come your ways come your ways an you draw backward we 'll put you i ' th ' fills.-Why do you not speak to her?-Come draw this curtain and let 's see your picture Alas the day how loath you are to offend daylight An ' twere dark you 'd close sooner So so rub on and kiss the mistress How now a kiss in fee farm Build there carpenter the air is sweet Nay you shall fight your hearts out ere I part you The falcon as the tercel for all the ducks i ' th ' river Go to go to You have bereft me of all words lady Words pay no debts give her deeds but she 'll bereave you o ' th ' deeds too if she call your activity in question What billing again Here 's ' In witness whereof the parties interchangeably ' Come in come in I 'll go get a fire Will you walk in my lord O Cressid how often have I wish'd me thus Wish'd my lord The gods grant O my lord What should they grant What makes this pretty abruption What too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love More dregs than water if my fears have eyes Fears make devils of cherubims they never see truly Blind fear that seeing reason leads finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear To fear the worst oft cures the worse O let my lady apprehend no fear In all Cupid 's pageant there is presented no monster Nor nothing monstrous neither Nothing but our undertakings when we vow to weep seas live in fire cat rocks tame tigers thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed This is the monstruosity in love lady that the will is infinite and the execution confin'd that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit They say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one They that have the voice of lions and the act of hares are they not monsters Are there such Such are not we Praise us as we are tasted allow us as we prove our head shall go bare till merit crown it No perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present We will not name desert before his birth and being born his addition shall be humble Few words to fair faith Troilus shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth and what truth can speak truest not truer than Troilus Will you walk in my lord What blushing still Have you not done talking yet Well uncle what folly I commit I dedicate to you I thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you you 'll give him me Be true to my lord if he flinch chide me for it You know now your hostages your uncle 's word and my firm faith Nay I 'll give my word for her too our kindred though they be long ere they are wooed they are constant being won they are burs I can tell you they 'll stick where they are thrown Boldness comes to me now and brings me heart Prince Troilus I have lov'd you night and day For many weary months Why was my Cressid then so hard to win Hard to seem won but I was won my lord With the first glance that ever pardon me If I confess much you will play the tyrant I love you now but till now not so much But I might master it In faith I lie My thoughts were like unbridled children grown Too headstrong for their mother See we fools Why have I blabb'd Who shall be true to us When we are so unsecret to ourselves But though I lov'd you well I woo'd you not And yet good faith I wish'd myself a man Or that we women had men 's privilege Of speaking first Sweet bid me hold my tongue For in this rapture I shall surely speak The thing I shall repent See see your silence Cunning in dumbness from my weakness draws My very soul of counsel Stop my mouth And shall albeit sweet music issues thence Pretty i ' faith My lord I do beseech you pardon me ' Twas not my purpose thus to beg a kiss I am asham'd O heavens what have I done For this time will I take my leave my lord Your leave sweet Cressid Leave An you take leave till to morrow morning- Pray you content you What offends you lady Sir mine own company You can not shun yourself Let me go and try I have a kind of self resides with you But an unkind self that itself will leave To be another 's fool I would be gone Where is my wit I know not what I speak Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely Perchance my lord I show more craft than love And fell so roundly to a large confession To angle for your thoughts but you are wise- Or else you love not for to be wise and love Exceeds man 's might that dwells with gods above O that I thought it could be in a woman- As if it can I will presume in you- To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love To keep her constancy in plight and youth Outliving beauty 's outward with a mind That doth renew swifter than blood decays Or that persuasion could but thus convince me That my integrity and truth to you Might be affronted with the match and weight Of such a winnowed purity in love How were I then uplifted but alas I am as true as truth 's simplicity And simpler than the infancy of truth In that I 'll war with you O virtuous fight When right with right wars who shall be most right True swains in love shall in the world to come Approve their truth by Troilus when their rhymes Full of protest of oath and big compare Want similes truth tir'd with iteration- As true as steel as plantage to the moon As sun to day as turtle to her mate As iron to adamant as earth to th ' centre- Yet after all comparisons of truth As truth 's authentic author to be cited ' As true as Troilus ' shall crown up the verse And sanctify the numbers Prophet may you be If I be false or swerve a hair from truth When time is old and hath forgot itself When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up And mighty states characterless are grated To dusty nothing yet let memory From false to false among false maids in love Upbraid my falsehood when th ' have said ' As false As air as water wind or sandy earth As fox to lamb or wolf to heifer 's calf Pard to the hind or stepdame to her son'- Yea let them say to stick the heart of falsehood ' As false as Cressid ' Go to a bargain made seal it seal it I 'll be the witness Here I hold your hand here my cousin 's If ever you prove false one to another since I have taken such pains to bring you together let all pitiful goers- between be call'd to the world 's end after my name call them all Pandars let all constant men be Troiluses all false women Cressids and all brokers between Pandars Say ' Amen ' Amen Amen Amen Whereupon I will show you a chamber and a bed which bed because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters press it to death Away And Cupid grant all tongue tied maidens here Bed chamber pander to provide this gear Exeunt Now Princes for the service I have done Th ' advantage of the time prompts me aloud To call for recompense Appear it to your mind That through the sight I bear in things to come I have abandon'd Troy left my possession Incurr'd a traitor 's name expos'd myself From certain and possess'd conveniences To doubtful fortunes sequest'ring from me all That time acquaintance custom and condition Made tame and most familiar to my nature And here to do you service am become As new into the world strange unacquainted- I do beseech you as in way of taste To give me now a little benefit Out of those many regist'red in promise Which you say live to come in my behalf What wouldst thou of us Troyan Make demand You have a Troyan prisoner call'd Antenor Yesterday took Troy holds him very dear Oft have you often have you thanks therefore- Desir'd my Cressid in right great exchange Whom Troy hath still denied but this Antenor I know is such a wrest in their affairs That their negotiations all must slack Wanting his manage and they will almost Give us a prince of blood a son of Priam In change of him Let him be sent great Princes And he shall buy my daughter and her presence Shall quite strike off all service I have done In most accepted pain Let Diomedes bear him And bring us Cressid hither Calchas shall have What he requests of us Good Diomed Furnish you fairly for this interchange Withal bring word if Hector will to morrow Be answer'd in his challenge Ajax is ready This shall I undertake and ' tis a burden Which I am proud to bear Achilles stands i ' th ' entrance of his tent Please it our general pass strangely by him As if he were forgot and Princes all Lay negligent and loose regard upon him I will come last ' Tis like he 'll question me Why such unplausive eyes are bent why turn'd on him If so I have derision med'cinable To use between your strangeness and his pride Which his own will shall have desire to drink It may do good Pride hath no other glass To show itself but pride for supple knees Feed arrogance and are the proud man 's fees We 'll execute your purpose and put on A form of strangeness as we pass along So do each lord and either greet him not Or else disdainfully which shall shake him more Than if not look'd on I will lead the way What comes the general to speak with me You know my mind I 'll fight no more ' gainst Troy What says Achilles Would he aught with us Would you my lord aught with the general No Nothing my lord The better Good day good day How do you How do you Exit What does the cuckold scorn me How now Patroclus Good morrow Ajax Ha Good morrow Ay and good next day too Exit What mean these fellows Know they not Achilles They pass by strangely They were us'd to bend To send their smiles before them to Achilles To come as humbly as they us'd to creep To holy altars What am I poor of late ' Tis certain greatness once fall'n out with fortune Must fall out with men too What the declin'd is He shall as soon read in the eyes of others As feel in his own fall for men like butterflies Show not their mealy wings but to the summer And not a man for being simply man Hath any honour but honour for those honours That are without him as place riches and favour Prizes of accident as oft as merit Which when they fall as being slippery standers The love that lean'd on them as slippery too Doth one pluck down another and together Die in the fall But ' tis not so with me Fortune and I are friends I do enjoy At ample point all that I did possess Save these men 's looks who do methinks find out Something not worth in me such rich beholding As they have often given Here is Ulysses I 'll interrupt his reading How now Ulysses Now great Thetis ' son What are you reading A strange fellow here Writes me that man how dearly ever parted How much in having or without or in- Can not make boast to have that which he hath Nor feels not what he owes but by reflection As when his virtues shining upon others Heat them and they retort that heat again To the first giver This is not strange Ulysses The beauty that is borne here in the face The bearer knows not but commends itself To others ' eyes nor doth the eye itself- That most pure spirit of sense behold itself Not going from itself but eye to eye opposed Salutes each other with each other 's form For speculation turns not to itself Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there Where it may see itself This is not strange at all I do not strain at the position- It is familiar but at the author 's drift Who in his circumstance expressly proves That no man is the lord of anything Though in and of him there be much consisting Till he communicate his parts to others Nor doth he of himself know them for aught Till he behold them formed in th ' applause Where th ' are extended who like an arch reverb'rate The voice again or like a gate of steel Fronting the sun receives and renders back His figure and his heat I was much rapt in this And apprehended here immediately Th ' unknown Ajax Heavens what a man is there A very horse that has he knows not what Nature what things there are Most abject in regard and dear in use What things again most dear in the esteem And poor in worth Now shall we see to morrow- An act that very chance doth throw upon him- Ajax renown'd O heavens what some men do While some men leave to do How some men creep in skittish Fortune's hall Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes How one man eats into another 's pride While pride is fasting in his wantonness To see these Grecian lords!-why even already They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder As if his foot were on brave Hector 's breast And great Troy shrinking I do believe it for they pass'd by me As misers do by beggars neither gave to me Good word nor look What are my deeds forgot Time hath my lord a wallet at his back Wherein he puts alms for oblivion A great siz'd monster of ingratitudes Those scraps are good deeds past which are devour'd As fast as they are made forgot as soon As done Perseverance dear my lord Keeps honour bright To have done is to hang Quite out of fashion like a rusty mail In monumental mock'ry Take the instant way For honour travels in a strait so narrow Where one but goes abreast Keep then the path For emulation hath a thousand sons That one by one pursue if you give way Or hedge aside from the direct forthright Like to an ent'red tide they all rush by And leave you hindmost Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank Lie there for pavement to the abject rear O'er run and trampled on Then what they do in present Though less than yours in past must o'ertop yours For Time is like a fashionable host That slightly shakes his parting guest by th ' hand And with his arms out stretch'd as he would fly Grasps in the corner The welcome ever smiles And farewell goes out sighing O let not virtue seek Remuneration for the thing it was For beauty wit High birth vigour of bone desert in service Love friendship charity are subjects all To envious and calumniating Time One touch of nature makes the whole world kin- That all with one consent praise new born gawds Though they are made and moulded of things past And give to dust that is a little gilt More laud than gilt o'er dusted The present eye praises the present object Then marvel not thou great and complete man That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax Since things in motion sooner catch the eye Than what stirs not The cry went once on thee And still it might and yet it may again If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive And case thy reputation in thy tent Whose glorious deeds but in these fields of late Made emulous missions ' mongst the gods themselves And drave great Mars to faction Of this my privacy I have strong reasons But ' gainst your privacy The reasons are more potent and heroical ' Tis known Achilles that you are in love With one of Priam 's daughters Ha known Is that a wonder The providence that 's in a watchful state Knows almost every grain of Plutus ' gold Finds bottom in th ' uncomprehensive deeps Keeps place with thought and almost like the gods Do thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles There is a mystery with whom relation Durst never meddle in the soul of state Which hath an operation more divine Than breath or pen can give expressure to All the commerce that you have had with Troy As perfectly is ours as yours my lord And better would it fit Achilles much To throw down Hector than Polyxena But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home When fame shall in our island sound her trump And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing ' Great Hector 's sister did Achilles win But our great Ajax bravely beat down him ' Farewell my lord I as your lover speak The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break Exit To this effect Achilles have I mov'd you A woman impudent and mannish grown Is not more loath'd than an effeminate man In time of action I stand condemn'd for this They think my little stomach to the war And your great love to me restrains you thus Sweet rouse yourself and the weak wanton Cupid Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold And like a dew drop from the lion 's mane Be shook to airy air Shall Ajax fight with Hector Ay and perhaps receive much honour by him I see my reputation is at stake My fame is shrewdly gor'd O then beware Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves Omission to do what is necessary Seals a commission to a blank of danger And danger like an ague subtly taints Even then when they sit idly in the sun Go call Thersites hither sweet Patroclus I 'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him T ' invite the Troyan lords after the combat To see us here unarm'd I have a woman 's longing An appetite that I am sick withal To see great Hector in his weeds of peace To talk with him and to behold his visage Even to my full of view A wonder What Ajax goes up and down the field asking for himself How so He must fight singly to morrow with Hector and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing How can that be Why ' a stalks up and down like a peacock a stride and a stand ruminaies like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard as who should say ' There were wit in this head an ' twould out ' and so there is but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint which will not show without knocking The man 's undone for ever for if Hector break not his neck i ' th ' combat he 'll break't himself in vainglory He knows not me I said ' Good morrow Ajax ' and he replies ' Thanks Agamemnon ' What think you of this man that takes me for the general He 's grown a very land fish languageless a monster A plague of opinion A man may wear it on both sides like leather jerkin Thou must be my ambassador to him Thersites Who I Why he 'll answer nobody he professes not answering Speaking is for beggars he wears his tongue in 's arms I will put on his presence Let Patroclus make his demands to me you shall see the pageant of Ajax To him Patroclus Tell him I humbly desire the valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector to come unarm'd to my tent and to procure safe conduct for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious six or seven times honour'd Captain General of the Grecian army et cetera Agamemnon Do this Jove bless great Ajax Hum I come from the worthy Achilles- Ha Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent- Hum And to procure safe conduct from Agamemnon Agamemnon Ay my lord Ha What you say to't God buy you with all my heart Your answer sir If to morrow be a fair day by eleven of the clock it will go one way or other Howsoever he shall pay for me ere he has me Your answer sir Fare ye well with all my heart Why but he is not in this tune is he No but he 's out a tune thus What music will be in him when Hector has knock'd out his brains I know not but I am sure none unless the fiddler Apollo get his sinews to make catlings on Come thou shalt bear a letter to him straight Let me carry another to his horse for that 's the more capable creature My mind is troubled like a fountain stirr'd And I myself see not the bottom of it Would the fountain of your mind were clear again that I might water an ass at it I had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance Exit See ho Who is that there It is the Lord Aeneas Is the Prince there in person Had I so good occasion to lie long As you Prince Paris nothing but heavenly business Should rob my bed mate of my company That 's my mind too Good morrow Lord Aeneas A valiant Greek Aeneas -take his hand Witness the process of your speech wherein You told how Diomed a whole week by days Did haunt you in the field Health to you valiant sir During all question of the gentle truce But when I meet you arm'd as black defiance As heart can think or courage execute The one and other Diomed embraces Our bloods are now in calm and so long health But when contention and occasion meet By Jove I 'll play the hunter for thy life With all my force pursuit and policy And thou shalt hunt a lion that will fly With his face backward In humane gentleness Welcome to Troy now by Anchises ' life Welcome indeed By Venus ' hand I swear No man alive can love in such a sort The thing he means to kill more excellently We sympathise Jove let Aeneas live If to my sword his fate be not the glory A thousand complete courses of the sun But in mine emulous honour let him die With every joint a wound and that to morrow We know each other well We do and long to know each other worse This is the most despiteful'st gentle greeting The noblest hateful love that e'er I heard of What business lord so early I was sent for to the King but why I know not His purpose meets you ' twas to bring this Greek To Calchas ' house and there to render him For the enfreed Antenor the fair Cressid Let 's have your company or if you please Haste there before us I constantly believe- Or rather call my thought a certain knowledge- My brother Troilus lodges there to night Rouse him and give him note of our approach With the whole quality wherefore I fear We shall be much unwelcome That I assure you Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece Than Cressid borne from Troy There is no help The bitter disposition of the time Will have it so On lord we 'll follow you Good morrow all Exit with servant And tell me noble Diomed faith tell me true Even in the soul of sound good fellowship- Who in your thoughts deserves fair Helen best Myself or Menelaus Both alike He merits well to have her that doth seek her Not making any scruple of her soilure With such a hell of pain and world of charge And you as well to keep her that defend her Not palating the taste of her dishonour With such a costly loss of wealth and friends He like a puling cuckold would drink up The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece You like a lecher out of whorish loins Are pleas'd to breed out your inheritors Both merits pois'd each weighs nor less nor more But he as he the heavier for a whore You are too bitter to your country woman She 's bitter to her country Hear me Paris For every false drop in her bawdy veins A Grecian 's life hath sunk for every scruple Of her contaminated carrion weight A Troyan hath been slain since she could speak She hath not given so many good words breath As for her Greeks and Troyans suff'red death Fair Diomed you do as chapmen do Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy But we in silence hold this virtue well We 'll not commend what we intend to sell Here lies our way Exeunt Dear trouble not yourself the morn is cold Then sweet my lord I 'll call mine uncle down He shall unbolt the gates Trouble him not To bed to bed Sleep kill those pretty eyes And give as soft attachment to thy senses As infants ' empty of all thought Good morrow then I prithee now to bed Are you aweary of me O Cressida but that the busy day Wak'd by the lark hath rous'd the ribald crows And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer I would not from thee Night hath been too brief Beshrew the witch with venomous wights she stays As tediously as hell but flies the grasps of love With wings more momentary swift than thought You will catch cold and curse me Prithee tarry You men will never tarry O foolish Cressid I might have still held off And then you would have tarried Hark there 's one up Within What 's all the doors open here It is your uncle A pestilence on him Now will he be mocking I shall have such a life How now how now How go maidenheads Here you maid Where 's my cousin Cressid Go hang yourself you naughty mocking uncle You bring me to do and then you flout me too To do what to do what Let her say what What have I brought you to do Come come beshrew your heart You 'll ne'er be good Nor suffer others Ha ha Alas poor wretch a poor capocchia hast not slept to night Would he not a naughty man let it sleep A bugbear take him Did not I tell you Would he were knock'd i ' th ' head Ha ha Come you are deceiv'd I think of no such thing Who 's there What 's the matter Will you beat down the door How now What 's the matter Good morrow lord good morrow Who 's there My lord Aeneas By my troth I knew you not What news with you so early Is not Prince Troilus here Here What should he do here Come he is here my lord do not deny him It doth import him much to speak with me Is he here say you It 's more than I know I 'll be sworn For my own part I came in late What should he do here Who!-nay then Come come you 'll do him wrong ere you are ware you 'll be so true to him to be false to him Do not you know of him but yet go fetch him hither go How now What 's the matter My lord I scarce have leisure to salute you My matter is so rash There is at hand Paris your brother and Deiphobus The Grecian Diomed and our Antenor Deliver'd to us and for him forthwith Ere the first sacrifice within this hour We must give up to Diomedes ' hand The Lady Cressida Is it so concluded By Priam and the general state of Troy They are at hand and ready to effect it How my achievements mock me I will go meet them and my lord Aeneas We met by chance you did not find me here Good good my lord the secrets of neighbour Pandar Have not more gift in taciturnity Is't possible No sooner got but lost The devil take Antenor The young prince will go mad A plague upon Antenor I would they had broke 's neck How now What 's the matter Who was here Ah ah Why sigh you so profoundly Where 's my lord Gone Tell me sweet uncle what 's the matter Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above O the gods What 's the matter Pray thee get thee in Would thou hadst ne'er been born I knew thou wouldst be his death O poor gentleman A plague upon Antenor Good uncle I beseech you on my knees I beseech you what 's the matter Thou must be gone wench thou must be gone thou art chang'd for Antenor thou must to thy father and be gone from Troilus ' Twill be his death ' twill be his bane he can not bear it O you immortal gods I will not go Thou must I will not uncle I have forgot my father I know no touch of consanguinity No kin no love no blood no soul so near me As the sweet Troilus O you gods divine Make Cressid 's name the very crown of falsehood If ever she leave Troilus Time force and death Do to this body what extremes you can But the strong base and building of my love Is as the very centre of the earth Drawing all things to it I 'll go in and weep- Do do Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart With sounding ' Troilus ' I will not go from Troy Exeunt It is great morning and the hour prefix'd For her delivery to this valiant Greek Comes fast upon Good my brother Troilus Tell you the lady what she is to do And haste her to the purpose Walk into her house I 'll bring her to the Grecian presently And to his hand when I deliver her Think it an altar and thy brother Troilus A priest there off'ring to it his own heart Exit I know what ' tis to love And would as I shall pity I could help Please you walk in my lords Exeunt Be moderate be moderate Why tell you me of moderation The grief is fine full perfect that I taste And violenteth in a sense as strong As that which causeth it How can I moderate it If I could temporize with my affections Or brew it to a weak and colder palate The like allayment could I give my grief My love admits no qualifying dross No more my grief in such a precious loss Here here here he comes Ah sweet ducks O Troilus Troilus Embracing him What a pair of spectacles is here Let me embrace too ' O heart ' as the goodly saying is Cressid I love thee in so strain'd a purity That the bless'd gods as angry with my fancy More bright in zeal than the devotion which Cold lips blow to their deities take thee from me Have the gods envy Ay ay ay ' tis too plain a case And is it true that I must go from Troy A hateful truth What and from Troilus too From Troy and Troilus Is't possible And suddenly where injury of chance Puts back leave taking justles roughly by All time of pause rudely beguiles our lips Of all rejoindure forcibly prevents Our lock'd embrasures strangles our dear vows Even in the birth of our own labouring breath We two that with so many thousand sighs Did buy each other must poorly sell ourselves With the rude brevity and discharge of one Injurious time now with a robber 's haste Crams his rich thievery up he knows not how As many farewells as be stars in heaven With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them He fumbles up into a loose adieu And scants us with a single famish'd kiss Distasted with the salt of broken tears Within My lord is the lady ready Hark you are call'd Some say the Genius so Cries ' Come ' to him that instantly must die Bid them have patience she shall come anon Where are my tears Rain to lay this wind or my heart will be blown up by th ' root Exit I must then to the Grecians No remedy A woeful Cressid ' mongst the merry Greeks When shall we see again Hear me my love Be thou but true of heart- I true how now What wicked deem is this Nay we must use expostulation kindly For it is parting from us I speak not ' Be thou true ' as fearing thee For I will throw my glove to Death himself That there 's no maculation in thy heart But ' Be thou true ' say I to fashion in My sequent protestation be thou true And I will see thee O you shall be expos'd my lord to dangers As infinite as imminent But I 'll be true And I 'll grow friend with danger Wear this sleeve And you this glove When shall I see you I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels To give thee nightly visitation But yet be true O heavens ' Be true ' again Hear why I speak it love The Grecian youths are full of quality They 're loving well compos'd with gifts of nature And flowing o'er with arts and exercise How novelties may move and parts with person Alas a kind of godly jealousy Which I beseech you call a virtuous sin Makes me afeard O heavens you love me not Die I a villain then In this I do not call your faith in question So mainly as my merit I can not sing Nor heel the high lavolt nor sweeten talk Nor play at subtle games fair virtues all To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant But I can tell that in each grace of these There lurks a still and dumb discoursive devil That tempts most cunningly But be not tempted Do you think I will No But something may be done that we will not And sometimes we are devils to ourselves When we will tempt the frailty of our powers Presuming on their changeful potency Within Nay good my lord Come kiss and let us part Within Brother Troilus Good brother come you hither And bring Aeneas and the Grecian with you My lord will you be true Who I Alas it is my vice my fault Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion I with great truth catch mere simplicity Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare Fair Lady Cressid So please you save the thanks this prince expects The lustre in your eye heaven in your cheek Pleads your fair usage and to Diomed You shall be mistress and command him wholly Grecian thou dost not use me courteously To shame the zeal of my petition to the In praising her I tell thee lord of Greece She is as far high soaring o'er thy praises As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant I charge thee use her well even for my charge For by the dreadful Pluto if thou dost not Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard I 'll cut thy throat O be not mov'd Prince Troilus Let me be privileg'd by my place and message To be a speaker free when I am hence I 'll answer to my lust And know you lord I 'll nothing do on charge to her own worth She shall be priz'd But that you say ' Be't so ' I speak it in my spirit and honour ' No ' Come to the port I 'll tell thee Diomed This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head Lady give me your hand and as we walk To our own selves bend we our needful talk Hark Hector 's trumpet How have we spent this morning The Prince must think me tardy and remiss That swore to ride before him to the field ' Tis Troilus ' fault Come come to field with him Let us make ready straight Yea with a bridegroom 's fresh alacrity Let us address to tend on Hector 's heels The glory of our Troy doth this day lie On his fair worth and single chivalry Exeunt Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair Anticipating time with starting courage Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy Thou dreadful Ajax that the appalled air May pierce the head of the great combatant And hale him hither Thou trumpet there 's my purse Now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe Blow villain till thy sphered bias cheek Out swell the colic of puff Aquilon'd Come stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood Thou blowest for Hector Trumpet sounds No trumpet answers ' Tis but early days Is not yond Diomed with Calchas ' daughter ' Tis he I ken the manner of his gait He rises on the toe That spirit of his In aspiration lifts him from the earth Is this the lady Cressid Even she Most dearly welcome to the Greeks sweet lady Our general doth salute you with a kiss Yet is the kindness but particular ' Twere better she were kiss'd in general And very courtly counsel I 'll begin So much for Nestor I 'll take that winter from your lips fair lady Achilles bids you welcome I had good argument for kissing once But that 's no argument for kissing now For thus popp'd Paris in his hardiment And parted thus you and your argument O deadly gall and theme of all our scorns For which we lose our heads to gild his horns The first was Menelaus ' kiss this mine- O this is trim Paris and I kiss evermore for him I 'll have my kiss sir Lady by your leave In kissing do you render or receive Both take and give I 'll make my match to live The kiss you take is better than you give Therefore no kiss I 'll give you boot I 'll give you three for one You are an odd man give even or give none An odd man lady Every man is odd No Paris is not for you know ' tis true That you are odd and he is even with you You fillip me o ' th ' head No I 'll be sworn It were no match your nail against his horn May I sweet lady beg a kiss of you You may I do desire it Why beg then Why then for Venus ' sake give me a kiss When Helen is a maid again and his I am your debtor claim it when ' tis due Never 's my day and then a kiss of you Lady a word I 'll bring you to your father A woman of quick sense Fie fie upon her There 's language in her eye her cheek her lip Nay her foot speaks her wanton spirits look out At every joint and motive of her body O these encounters so glib of tongue That give a coasting welcome ere it comes And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts To every ticklish reader Set them down For sluttish spoils of opportunity And daughters of the game Trumpet within The Troyans ' trumpet Yonder comes the troop Hail all the state of Greece What shall be done To him that victory commands Or do you purpose A victor shall be known Will you the knights Shall to the edge of all extremity Pursue each other or shall they be divided By any voice or order of the field Hector bade ask Which way would Hector have it He cares not he 'll obey conditions ' Tis done like Hector but securely done A little proudly and great deal misprizing The knight oppos'd If not Achilles sir What is your name If not Achilles nothing Therefore Achilles But whate'er know this In the extremity of great and little Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector The one almost as infinite as all The other blank as nothing Weigh him well And that which looks like pride is courtesy This Ajax is half made of Hector 's blood In love whereof half Hector stays at home Half heart half hand half Hector comes to seek This blended knight half Troyan and half Greek A maiden battle then O I perceive you Here is Sir Diomed Go gentle knight Stand by our Ajax As you and Lord Eneas Consent upon the order of their fight So be it either to the uttermost Or else a breath The combatants being kin Half stints their strife before their strokes begin They are oppos'd already What Troyan is that same that looks so heavy The youngest son of Priam a true knight Not yet mature yet matchless firm of word Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue Not soon provok'd nor being provok'd soon calm'd His heart and hand both open and both free For what he has he gives what thinks he shows Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty Nor dignifies an impair thought with breath Manly as Hector but more dangerous For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes To tender objects but he in heat of action Is more vindicative than jealous love They call him Troilus and on him erect A second hope as fairly built as Hector Thus says Aeneas one that knows the youth Even to his inches and with private soul Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me They are in action Now Ajax hold thine own Hector thou sleep'st Awake thee His blows are well dispos'd There Ajax You must no more Princes enough so please you I am not warm yet let us fight again As Hector pleases Why then will I no more Thou art great lord my father 's sister 's son A cousin german to great Priam 's seed The obligation of our blood forbids A gory emulation ' twixt us twain Were thy commixtion Greek and Troyan so That thou could'st say ' This hand is Grecian all And this is Troyan the sinews of this leg All Greek and this all Troy my mother 's blood Runs on the dexter cheek and this sinister Bounds in my father 's ' by Jove multipotent Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member Wherein my sword had not impressure made Of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother My sacred aunt should by my mortal sword Be drained Let me embrace thee Ajax By him that thunders thou hast lusty arms Hector would have them fall upon him thus Cousin all honour to thee I thank thee Hector Thou art too gentle and too free a man I came to kill thee cousin and bear hence A great addition earned in thy death Not Neoptolemus so mirable On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes Cries ' This is he ' could promise to himself A thought of added honour torn from Hector There is expectance here from both the sides What further you will do We 'll answer it The issue is embracement Ajax farewell If I might in entreaties find success As seld I have the chance I would desire My famous cousin to our Grecian tents ' Tis Agamemnon 's wish and great Achilles Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector Aeneas call my brother Troilus to me And signify this loving interview To the expecters of our Troyan part Desire them home Give me thy hand my cousin I will go eat with thee and see your knights Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here The worthiest of them tell me name by name But for Achilles my own searching eyes Shall find him by his large and portly size Worthy all arms as welcome as to one That would be rid of such an enemy But that 's no welcome Understand more clear What 's past and what 's to come is strew'd with husks And formless ruin of oblivion But in this extant moment faith and troth Strain'd purely from all hollow bias drawing Bids thee with most divine integrity From heart of very heart great Hector welcome I thank thee most imperious Agamemnon To Troilus My well fam'd lord of Troy no less to you Let me confirm my princely brother 's greeting You brace of warlike brothers welcome hither Who must we answer The noble Menelaus O you my lord By Mars his gauntlet thanks Mock not that I affect the untraded oath Your quondam wife swears still by Venus ' glove She 's well but bade me not commend her to you Name her not now sir she 's a deadly theme O pardon I offend I have thou gallant Troyan seen thee oft Labouring for destiny make cruel way Through ranks of Greekish youth and I have seen thee As hot as Perseus spur thy Phrygian steed Despising many forfeits and subduements When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i ' th ' air Not letting it decline on the declined That I have said to some my standers by ' Lo Jupiter is yonder dealing life ' And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in Like an Olympian wrestling This have I seen But this thy countenance still lock'd in steel I never saw till now I knew thy grandsire And once fought with him He was a soldier good But by great Mars the captain of us all Never like thee O let an old man embrace thee And worthy warrior welcome to our tents ' Tis the old Nestor Let me embrace thee good old chronicle That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time Most reverend Nestor I am glad to clasp thee I would my arms could match thee in contention As they contend with thee in courtesy I would they could Ha By this white beard I 'd fight with thee to morrow Well welcome welcome I have seen the time I wonder now how yonder city stands When we have here her base and pillar by us I know your favour Lord Ulysses well Ah sir there 's many a Greek and Troyan dead Since first I saw yourself and Diomed In Ilion on your Greekish embassy Sir I foretold you then what would ensue My prophecy is but half his journey yet For yonder walls that pertly front your town Yond towers whose wanton tops do buss the clouds Must kiss their own feet I must not believe you There they stand yet and modestly I think The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost A drop of Grecian blood The end crowns all And that old common arbitrator Time Will one day end it So to him we leave it Most gentle and most valiant Hector welcome After the General I beseech you next To feast with me and see me at my tent I shall forestall thee Lord Ulysses thou Now Hector I have fed mine eyes on thee I have with exact view perus'd thee Hector And quoted joint by joint Is this Achilles I am Achilles Stand fair I pray thee let me look on thee Behold thy fill Nay I have done already Thou art too brief I will the second time As I would buy thee view thee limb by limb O like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er But there 's more in me than thou understand'st Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye Tell me you heavens in which part of his body Shall I destroy him Whether there or there or there That I may give the local wound a name And make distinct the very breach whereout Hector 's great spirit flew Answer me heavens It would discredit the blest gods proud man To answer such a question Stand again Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly As to prenominate in nice conjecture Where thou wilt hit me dead I tell thee yea Wert thou an oracle to tell me so I 'd not believe thee Henceforth guard thee well For I 'll not kill thee there nor there nor there But by the forge that stithied Mars his helm I 'll kill thee everywhere yea o'er and o'er You wisest Grecians pardon me this brag His insolence draws folly from my lips But I 'll endeavour deeds to match these words Or may I never- Do not chafe thee cousin And you Achilles let these threats alone Till accident or purpose bring you to't You may have every day enough of Hector If you have stomach The general state I fear Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him I pray you let us see you in the field We have had pelting wars since you refus'd The Grecians ' cause Dost thou entreat me Hector To morrow do I meet thee fell as death To night all friends Thy hand upon that match First all you peers of Greece go to my tent There in the full convive we afterwards As Hector 's leisure and your bounties shall Concur together severally entreat him Beat loud the tambourines let the trumpets blow That this great soldier may his welcome know My Lord Ulysses tell me I beseech you In what place of the field doth Calchas keep At Menelaus ' tent most princely Troilus There Diomed doth feast with him to night Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view On the fair Cressid Shall I sweet lord be bound to you so much After we part from Agamemnon 's tent To bring me thither You shall command me sir As gentle tell me of what honour was This Cressida in Troy Had she no lover there That wails her absence O sir to such as boasting show their scars A mock is due Will you walk on my lord She was belov'd she lov'd she is and doth But still sweet love is food for fortune 's tooth Exeunt I 'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to night Which with my scimitar I 'll cool to morrow Patroclus let us feast him to the height Here comes Thersites How now thou core of envy Thou crusty batch of nature what 's the news Why thou picture of what thou seemest and idol of idiot worshippers here 's a letter for thee From whence fragment Why thou full dish of fool from Troy Who keeps the tent now The surgeon 's box or the patient 's wound Well said Adversity and what needs these tricks Prithee be silent boy I profit not by thy talk thou art said to be Achilles '

eyes dirt rotten livers wheezing lungs bladders full of imposthume sciaticas limekilns i ' th ' palm incurable bone ache and the rivelled fee- simple of the tetter take and take again such

exasperate thou idle immaterial skein of sleid silk thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye thou tassel of a prodigal 's purse thou Ah how the poor world is pest'red with such water flies diminutives of nature Out gall Finch egg My sweet Patroclus I am thwarted quite From my great purpose in to morrow 's battle Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba A token from her daughter my fair love Both taxing me and gaging me to keep An oath that I have sworn I will not break it Fall Greeks fail fame honour or go or stay My major vow lies here this I 'll obey Come come Thersites help to trim my tent This night in banqueting must all be spent Away Patroclus Exit with PATROCLUS With too much blood and too little brain these two may run mad but if with too much brain and to little blood they do I 'll be a curer of madmen Here 's Agamemnon an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails but he has not so much brain as ear wax and the goodly transformation of Jupiter there his brother the bull the primitive statue and oblique memorial of cuckolds a thrifty shoeing horn in a chain hanging at his brother 's leg to what form but that he is should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to To an ass were nothing he is both ass and ox To an ox were nothing he is both ox and ass To be a dog a mule a cat a fitchew a toad a lizard an owl a put tock or a herring without a roe I

Come come enter my tent That same Diomed 's a false hearted rogue a most unjust knave I will no more trust him when he leers than I will a serpent when he hisses He will spend his mouth and promise like Brabbler the hound but when he performs astronomers foretell it it is prodigious there will come some change the sun borrows of the moon when Diomed keeps his word I will rather leave to see Hector than not to dog him They say he keeps a Troyan drab and uses the traitor Calchas ' tent I 'll after Nothing but lechery All incontinent varlets Exit What are you up here ho Speak Within Who calls Diomed Calchas I think Where 's your daughter Within She comes to you Stand where the torch may not discover us Cressid comes forth to him How now my charge Now my sweet guardian Hark a word

together Fry lechery fry But will you then In faith I will lo never trust me else Give me some token for the surety of it I 'll fetch you one Exit You have sworn patience Fear me not my lord I will not be myself nor have cognition Of what I feel I am all patience Now the pledge now now now Here Diomed keep this sleeve O beauty where is thy faith My lord I will be patient outwardly I will You

Now she sharpens Well said whetstone I shall have it What this Ay that O all you gods O pretty pretty pledge Thy master now lies thinking on his bed Of thee and me and sighs and takes my glove And gives memorial dainty kisses to it As I kiss thee Nay do not snatch it from me He that takes that doth take my heart withal I had your heart before this follows it I did swear patience You shall not

go One can not speak a word But it straight starts you I do not like this fooling Nor I by Pluto but that that likes not you Pleases me best What shall I come The hour- Ay come O Jove Do come I shall be plagu'd Farewell till then Good night I prithee come Exit DIOMEDES Troilus farewell One eye yet looks on thee But with my heart the other eye doth see Ah poor our sex this fault in us I find The error of our eye directs our mind What error leads must err O then conclude Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude Exit A proof of strength she could not publish more Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore ' All 's done my lord It is Why stay we then To make a recordation to my soul Of every syllable that here was spoke But if I tell how these two did coact Shall I not lie in publishing a truth Sith yet there is a credence in my heart An esperance so obstinately strong That doth invert th ' attest of eyes and ears As if those organs had deceptious functions Created only to calumniate Was Cressid here I can not conjure Troyan She was not sure Most sure she was Why my negation hath no taste of madness Nor mine my lord Cressid was here but now Let it not be believ'd for womanhood Think we had mothers do not give advantage To stubborn critics apt without a theme For depravation to square the general sex By Cressid 's rule Rather think this not Cressid What hath she done Prince that can soil our mothers Nothing at all unless that this were she Will ' a swagger himself out on 's own eyes This she No this is Diomed 's Cressida If beauty have a soul this is not she If souls guide vows if vows be sanctimonies If sanctimony be the god 's delight If there be rule in unity itself This was not she O madness of discourse That cause sets up with and against itself Bifold authority where reason can revolt Without perdition and loss assume all reason Without revolt this is and is not Cressid Within my soul there doth conduce a fight Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate Divides more wider than the sky and earth And yet the spacious breadth of this division Admits no orifex for a point as subtle As Ariachne 's broken woof to enter Instance O instance strong as Pluto 's gates Cressid is mine tied with the bonds of heaven Instance O instance strong as heaven itself The bonds of heaven are slipp'd dissolv'd and loos'd And with another knot five finger tied The fractions of her faith orts of her love The fragments scraps the bits and greasy relics Of her o'er eaten faith are bound to Diomed May worthy Troilus be half attach'd With that which here his passion doth express Ay Greek and that shall be divulged well In characters as red as Mars his heart Inflam'd with Venus Never did young man fancy With so eternal and so fix'd a soul Hark Greek as much as I do Cressid love So much by weight hate I her Diomed That sleeve is mine that he 'll bear on his helm Were it a casque compos'd by Vulcan 's skill My sword should bite it Not the dreadful spout Which shipmen do the hurricano call Constring'd in mass by the almighty sun Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune 's ear In his descent than shall my prompted sword Falling on Diomed He 'll tickle it for his concupy O Cressid O false Cressid false false false Let all untruths stand by thy stained name And they 'll seem glorious O contain yourself Your passion draws ears hither I have been seeking you this hour my lord Hector by this is arming him in Troy Ajax your guard stays to conduct you home Have with you Prince My courteous lord adieu Fairwell revolted fair!-and Diomed Stand fast and wear a castle on thy head I 'll bring you to the gates Accept distracted thanks Would I could meet that rogue Diomed I would croak like a raven I would bode I would bode Patroclus will give me anything for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab Lechery lechery Still wars and lechery Nothing else holds fashion A burning devil take them Exit When was my lord so much ungently temper'd To stop his ears against admonishment Unarm unarm and do not fight to day You train me to offend you get you in By all the everlasting gods I 'll go My dreams will sure prove ominous to the day No more I say Where is my brother Hector Here sister arm'd and bloody in intent Consort with me in loud and dear petition Pursue we him on knees for I have dreamt Of bloody turbulence and this whole night Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter O ' tis true Ho bid my trumpet sound No notes of sally for the heavens sweet brother Be gone I say The gods have heard me swear The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows They are polluted off'rings more abhorr'd Than spotted livers in the sacrifice O be persuaded Do not count it holy To hurt by being just It is as lawful For we would give much to use violent thefts And rob in the behalf of charity It is the purpose that makes strong the vow But vows to every purpose must not hold Unarm sweet Hector Hold you still I say Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate Life every man holds dear but the dear man Holds honour far more precious dear than life Cassandra call my father to persuade No faith young Troilus doff thy harness youth I am to day i ' th ' vein of chivalry Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong And tempt not yet the brushes of the war Unarm thee go and doubt thou not brave boy I 'll stand to day for thee and me and Troy Brother you have a vice of mercy in you Which better fits a lion than a man What vice is that good Troilus Chide me for it When many times the captive Grecian falls Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword You bid them rise and live O ' tis fair play Fool 's play by heaven Hector How now how now For th ' love of all the gods Let 's leave the hermit Pity with our mother And when we have our armours buckled on The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords Spur them to ruthful work rein them from ruth Fie savage fie Hector then ' tis wars Troilus I would not have you fight to day Who should withhold me Not fate obedience nor the hand of Mars Beck'ning with fiery truncheon my retire Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears Nor you my brother with your true sword drawn Oppos'd to hinder me should stop my way But by my ruin Lay hold upon him Priam hold him fast He is thy crutch now if thou lose thy stay Thou on him leaning and all Troy on thee Fall all together Come Hector come go back Thy wife hath dreamt thy mother hath had visions Cassandra doth foresee and I myself Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt To tell thee that this day is ominous Therefore come back Aeneas is a field And I do stand engag'd to many Greeks Even in the faith of valour to appear This morning to them Ay but thou shalt not go I must not break my faith You know me dutiful therefore dear sir Let me not shame respect but give me leave To take that course by your consent and voice Which you do here forbid me royal Priam O Priam yield not to him Do not dear father Andromache I am offended with you Upon the love you bear me get you in This foolish dreaming superstitious girl Makes all these bodements O farewell dear Hector Look how thou diest Look how thy eye turns pale Look how thy wounds do bleed at many vents Hark how Troy roars how Hecuba cries out How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth Behold distraction frenzy and amazement Like witless antics one another meet And all cry Hector Hector 's dead O Hector Away away Farewell!-yet soft Hector I take my leave Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive Exit You are amaz'd my liege at her exclaim Go in and cheer the town we 'll forth and fight Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night Farewell The gods with safety stand about thee They are at it hark Proud Diomed believe I come to lose my arm or win my sleeve Do you hear my lord Do you hear What now Here 's a letter come from yond poor girl Let me read A whoreson tisick a whoreson rascally tisick so troubles me and the foolish fortune of this girl and what one thing what another that I shall leave you one o ' th 's days and I have a rheum in mine eyes too and such an ache in my bones that unless a man were curs'd I can not tell what to think on't What says she there Words words mere words no matter from the heart Th ' effect doth operate another way Now they are clapper clawing one another I 'll go look on That dissembling abominable varlet Diomed has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave 's sleeve of Troy there in his helm I would fain see them meet that that same young Troyan ass that loves the whore there might send that Greekish whoremasterly villain with the sleeve back to the dissembling luxurious drab of a sleeve less errand A th ' t'other side the policy of those crafty swearing rascals that stale old mouse eaten dry cheese Nestor and that same dog fox Ulysses -is not prov'd worth a blackberry They set me up in policy that mongrel cur Ajax against that dog of as bad a kind Achilles and now is the cur Ajax prouder than the cur Achilles and will not arm to day whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim barbarism and policy grows into an ill opinion Fly not for shouldst thou take the river Styx I would swim after Thou dost miscall retire I do not fly but advantageous care Withdrew me from the odds of multitude Have at thee Hold thy whore Grecian now for thy whore Troyan now the sleeve now the sleeve What art thou Greek Art thou for Hector 's match Art thou of blood and honour No no I am a rascal a scurvy railing knave a very filthy rogue I do believe thee Live Exit God a mercy that thou wilt believe me but a plague break thy neck for frighting me What 's become of the wenching rogues I think they have swallowed one another I would laugh at that miracle Yet in a sort lechery eats itself I 'll seek them Exit Go go my servant take thou Troilus ' horse Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid Fellow commend my service to her beauty Tell her I have chastis'd the amorous Troyan And am her knight by proof I go my lord Exit Renew renew The fierce Polydamus Hath beat down enon bastard Margarelon Hath Doreus prisoner And stands

bruis'd The dreadful Sagittary Appals our numbers Haste we Diomed To reinforcement or we perish all Go bear Patroclus ' body to Achilles And bid the snail pac'd Ajax arm for shame There is a thousand Hectors in the field Now here he fights on Galathe his horse And there lacks work anon he 's there afoot And there they fly or die like scaled sculls Before the belching whale then is he yonder And there the strawy Greeks ripe for his edge Fall down before him like the mower 's swath Here there and everywhere he leaves and takes Dexterity so obeying appetite That what he will he does and does so much That proof is call'd impossibility O courage courage courage Princes Great Achilles Is arming weeping cursing vowing vengeance Patroclus ' wounds have rous'd his drowsy blood Together with his mangled Myrmidons That noseless handless hack'd and chipp'd come to him Crying on Hector Ajax hath lost a friend And foams at mouth and he is arm'd and at it Roaring for Troilus who hath done to day Mad and fantastic execution Engaging and redeeming of himself With such a careless force and forceless care As if that luck in very spite of cunning Bade him win all Troilus thou coward Troilus Exit Ay there there So so we draw together Exit Where is this Hector Come come thou boy queller show thy face Know what it is to meet Achilles angry Hector where 's Hector I will none but Hector Exeunt

Troyan trumpets sound the like my lord The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth And stickler like the armies separates My half supp'd sword that frankly would have fed Pleas'd with this dainty bait thus goes to bed Hark hark what shout is this Peace drums Within Achilles Achilles Hector 's slain Achilles The bruit is Hector 's slain and by Achilles If it be so yet bragless let it be Great Hector was as good a man as he March patiently along Let one be sent To pray Achilles see us at our tent If in his death the gods have us befriended Great Troy is ours and our sharp wars are ended Exeunt Stand ho yet are we masters of the field Never go home here starve we out the night Hector is slain Hector The gods forbid He 's dead and at the murderer 's horse 's tail In beastly sort dragg'd through the shameful field Frown on you heavens effect your rage with speed Sit gods upon your thrones and smile at Troy I say at once let your brief plagues be mercy And linger not our sure destructions on My lord you do discomfort all the host You understand me not that tell me so I do not speak of flight of fear of death But dare all imminence that gods and men Address their dangers in Hector is gone Who shall tell Priam so or Hecuba Let him that will a screech owl aye be call'd Go in to Troy and say there ' Hector 's dead ' There is a word will Priam turn to stone Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives Cold statues of the youth and in a word Scare Troy out of itself But march away Hector is dead there is no more to say Stay yet You vile abominable tents Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains Let Titan rise as early as he dare I 'll through and through you And thou great siz'd coward No space of earth shall sunder our two hates I 'll haunt thee like a wicked

Ignominy and shame Pursue thy life and live aye with thy name A goodly medicine for my aching bones world world thus is the poor agent despis'd traitors and bawds how earnestly are you set a work and how ill requited Why should our endeavour be so lov'd and the performance so loathed What verse for it What instance for it Let me see- If music be the food of love play on Give me excess of it that surfeiting The appetite may sicken and so die That strain again It had a dying fall O it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets Stealing and giving odour Enough no more ' Tis not so sweet now as it was before O spirit of love how quick and fresh art thou That notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea nought enters there Of what validity and pitch soe'er But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute So full of shapes is fancy That it alone is high fantastical Will you go hunt my lord What Curio The hart Why so I do the noblest that I have O when mine eyes did see Olivia first Methought she purg'd the air of pestilence That instant was I turn'd into a hart And my desires like fell and cruel hounds E'er since pursue me So please my lord I might not be admitted But from her handmaid do return this answer The element itself till seven years ' heat Shall not behold her face at ample view But like a cloistress she will veiled walk And water once a day her chamber round With eye offending brine all this to season A brother 's dead love which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance O she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother How will she love when the rich golden shaft Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else That live in her when liver brain and heart These sovereign thrones are all supplied and fill'd Her sweet perfections with one self king Away before me to sweet beds of flow'rs Love thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow'rs What country friends is this This is Illyria lady And what should I do in Illyria My brother he is in Elysium Perchance he is not drown'd- what think you sailors It is perchance that you yourself were saved O my poor brother and so perchance may he be True madam and to comfort you with chance Assure yourself after our ship did split When you and those poor number saved with you Hung on our driving boat I saw your brother Most provident in peril bind himself- Courage and hope both teaching him the practice- To a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea Where like Arion on the dolphin 's back I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see For saying so there 's gold Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope Whereto thy speech serves for authority The like of him Know'st thou this country Ay madam well for I was bred and born Not three hours ' travel from this very place Who governs here A noble duke in nature as in name What is his name Orsino Orsino I have heard my father name him He was a bachelor then And so is now or was so very late For but a month ago I went from hence And then ' twas fresh in murmur- as you know What great ones do the less will prattle of- That he did seek the love of fair Olivia What 's she A virtuous maid the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since then leaving her In the protection of his son her brother Who shortly also died for whose dear love They say she hath abjur'd the company And sight of men O that I serv'd that lady And might not be delivered to the world Till I had made mine own occasion mellow What my estate is That were hard to compass Because she will admit no kind of suit- No not the Duke 's There is a fair behaviour in thee Captain And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character I prithee and I 'll pay thee bounteously Conceal me what I am and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent I 'll serve this duke Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him It may be worth thy pains for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service What else may hap to time I will commit Only shape thou silence to my wit Be you his eunuch and your mute I 'll be When my tongue blabs then let mine eyes not see I thank thee Lead me on Exeunt What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus I am sure care 's an enemy to life By my troth Sir Toby you must come in earlier o ' nights your cousin my lady takes great exceptions to your ill hours Why let her except before excepted Ay but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order Confine I 'll confine myself no finer than I am These clothes are good enough to drink in and so be these boots too an they be not let them hang themselves in their own straps That quaffing and drinking will undo you I heard my lady talk of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer Who Sir Andrew Aguecheek Ay he He 's as tall a man as any 's in Illyria What 's that to th ' purpose Why he has three thousand ducats a year Ay but he 'll have but a year in all these ducats he 's a very fool and a prodigal Fie that you 'll say so He plays o ' th ' viol de gamboys and speaks three or four languages word for word without book and hath all the good gifts of nature He hath indeed almost natural for besides that he 's a fool he 's a great quarreller and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling ' tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave By this hand they are scoundrels and subtractors that say so of him Who are they They that add moreover he 's drunk nightly in your company With drinking healths to my niece I 'll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria He 's a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o ' th ' toe like a parish top What wench Castiliano vulgo for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface Sir Toby Belch How now Sir Toby Belch Sweet Sir Andrew Bless you fair shrew And you too sir Accost Sir Andrew accost What 's that My niece 's chambermaid Good Mistress Accost I desire better acquaintance My name is Mary sir Good Mistress Mary Accost- By my troth I would not

full of them Ay sir I have them at my fingers ' ends marry now I let go your hand I am barren Exit MARIA O knight thou lack'st a cup of canary When did I see thee so put down Never in your life I think unless you see canary put me down Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has but I am great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit No question An I thought that I 'd forswear it I 'll ride home to morrow Sir Toby Pourquoi my dear knight What is ' pourquoi'- do or not do I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing dancing and bear baiting Oh had I but followed the arts Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair Why would that have mended my hair Past question for thou seest it will not curl by nature But it becomes me well enough does't not Excellent it hangs like flax on a distaff and I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs and spin it off Faith I 'll home to morrow Sir Toby Your niece will

these kickshawses knight As any man in Illyria whatsoever he be under the degree of my betters and yet I will not compare with an old man What is thy excellence in a galliard knight Faith I can cut a caper And I can cut the mutton to't And I think I have the back trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria Wherefore are these things hid Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before 'em Are they like to take dust like Mistress Mall 's picture Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto My very walk should be a jig I would not so much as make water but in a sink a pace What dost thou mean Is it a world to hide virtues in I did think by the excellent constitution of thy leg it was form'd under the star of a galliard Ay ' tis strong and it does indifferent well in flame colour'd stock Shall we set about some revels What shall we do else Were we not born under Taurus Taurus That 's sides and heart No sir it is legs and thighs Let me see the caper Ha higher Ha

civil bounds Rather than make unprofited return Say I do speak with her my lord what then O then unfold the passion of my love Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith It shall become thee well to act my woes She will attend it better in thy youth Than in a nuncio 's of more grave aspect I think not so my lord Dear lad believe it For they shall yet belie thy happy years That say thou art a man Diana 's lip Is not more smooth and rubious thy small pipe Is as the maiden 's organ shrill and sound And all is semblative a woman 's part I know thy constellation is right apt For this affair Some four or five attend him- All if you will for I myself am best When least in company Prosper well in this And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord To call his fortunes thine I 'll do my best To woo your lady Aside Yet a barful strife Whoe'er I woo myself would be his wife Nay either tell me where thou hast been or I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in way of thy excuse my lady will hang thee for thy absence Let her hang me He that is well hang'd in this world needs to fear no colours Make that good He shall see none to fear A good lenten answer I can tell thee where that saying was born of ' I fear no colours ' Where good Mistress Mary In the wars and that may you be bold to say in your foolery Well God give them wisdom that have it and those that are fools let them use their talents Yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent or to be turn'd away- is not that as good as a hanging to you Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage and for turning away let summer bear it out You are resolute then Not so neither but I am resolv'd on two points That if one break the other will hold or if both break your gaskins fall Apt in good faith very apt Well go

that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink then is the fool not dry Bid the dishonest man mend himself if he mend he is no longer dishonest if he can not let the botcher mend him Anything that 's mended is but patch'd virtue that transgresses is but patch'd with sin and sin that amends is but patch'd with virtue If that this simple syllogism will serve so if it will not what remedy As there is no true cuckold but calamity so beauty 's a flower The lady bade take away the fool therefore I say again take her away Sir I bade them take away you Misprision in the highest degree Lady ' Cucullus non facit monachum ' that 's as much to say as I wear not motley in my brain Good madonna give me leave to prove you a fool Can you do it Dexteriously good madonna Make your

your folly Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool How say you to that Malvolio I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone Look you now he 's out of his guard already unless you laugh and minister occasion to him he is gagg'd I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools ' zanies O you are sick of self love Malvolio and taste with a distemper'd appetite To be generous guiltless and of free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets There is no slander in an allow'd fool though he do nothing but rail nor no railing in known discreet man though he do nothing but reprove Now Mercury endue thee with leasing for thou speak'st well of fools Madam there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you From the

swears he will speak with you I told him you were sick he takes on him to understand so much Tell him he shall not speak with me Has been told so and he says he 'll stand at your door like a sheriff 's post and be the supporter to a bench but he 'll speak with you What kind o ' man is he Why of mankind What manner of man Of very ill manner he 'll speak with you will you or no Of what personage and years is he Not yet old enough for a man nor young enough for a boy as a squash is before ' tis a peascod or a codling when ' tis almost an apple ' tis with him in standing water between boy and man He is very well favour'd and he speaks very shrewishly one would think his mother 's milk were scarce out of him Let him approach Call in my gentlewoman Gentlewoman my lady calls Exit Give me my veil come throw it o'er my face We 'll once more hear Orsino 's embassy The honourable lady of the house which is she Speak to me I shall answer for her Your will Most radiant exquisite and unmatchable beauty- I pray you tell me if this be the lady of the house for I never saw her I would be loath to cast away my speech for besides that it is excellently well penn'd I have taken great pains to con it Good beauties let me sustain no scorn I am very comptible even to the least sinister usage Whence came you sir I can say little more than I have studied and that question 's out of my part Good gentle one give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house that I may proceed in my speech Are you a comedian No my profound heart and yet by the very fangs of malice I swear I am not that I play Are you the lady of the house If I do not usurp myself I am Most certain if you are she you do usurp yourself for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve But this is from my commission I will on with my speech in your praise and then show you the heart of my message Come to what is important in't I forgive you the praise Alas I took great pains to study it and ' tis poetical It is the more like to be feigned I pray you keep it in I heard you were saucy at my gates and allow'd your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you If you be not mad be gone if you have reason be brief ' tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping dialogue Will you hoist sail sir Here lies your way No good swabber I am to hull here a little longer Some mollification for your giant sweet lady Tell me your mind I am a messenger Sure you have some hideous matter to deliver when the courtesy of it is so fearful Speak your office It alone concerns your ear I bring no overture of war no taxation of homage I hold the olive in my hand my words are as full of peace as matter Yet you began rudely What are you What would you The rudeness that hath appear'd in me have I learn'd from my entertainment What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead- to your cars divinity to any other 's profanation Give us the place alone we will hear this divinity Exeunt MARIA and ATTENDANTS Now sir what is your text Most sweet lady- A comfortable doctrine and much may be said of it Where lies your text In Orsino 's bosom In his bosom In what chapter of his bosom To answer by the method in the first of his heart O I have read it it is heresy Have you no more to say Good madam let me see your face Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face You are now out of your text but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture Unveiling Look you sir such a one I was this present Is't not well done Excellently done if God did all ' Tis in grain sir ' twill endure wind and weather ' Tis beauty truly blent whose red and white Nature 's own sweet and cunning hand laid on Lady you are the cruell'st she alive If you will lead these graces to the grave And leave the world no copy O sir I will not be so hard hearted I will give out divers schedules of my beauty It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labell'd to my will as- item two lips indifferent red item two grey eyes with lids to them item one neck one chin and so forth Were you sent hither to praise me I see you what you are you are too proud But if you were the devil you are fair My lord and master loves you- O such love Could be but recompens'd though you were crown'd The nonpareil of beauty How does he love me With adorations fertile tears With groans that thunder love with sighs of fire Your lord does know my mind I can not love him Yet I suppose him virtuous know him noble Of great estate of fresh and stainless youth In voices well divulg'd free learn'd and valiant And in dimension and the shape of nature A gracious person but yet I can not love him He might have took his answer long ago If I did love you in my master 's flame With such a suff'ring such a deadly life In your denial I would find no sense I would not understand it Why what would you Make me a willow cabin at your gate And call upon my soul within the house Write loyal cantons of contemned love And sing them loud even in the dead of night Halloo your name to the reverberate hals And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out ' Olivia ' O you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth But you should pity me You might do much What is your parentage Above my fortunes yet my state is well I am a gentleman Get you to your lord I can not love him let him send no more- Unless perchance you come to me again To tell me how he takes it Fare you well I thank you for your pains spend this for me I am no fee'd post lady keep your purse My master not myself lacks recompense Love make his heart of flint that you shall love And let your fervour like my master 's be Plac'd in contempt Farewell fair cruelty Exit ' What is your parentage ' ' Above my fortunes yet my state is well I am a gentleman ' I 'll be sworn thou art Thy tongue thy face thy limbs actions and spirit Do give thee five fold blazon Not too fast Soft soft Unless the master were the man How now Even so quickly may one catch the plague Methinks I feel this youth 's perfections With an invisible and subtle stealth To creep in at mine eyes Well let it be What ho Malvolio Here madam at your service Run after that same peevish messenger The County 's man He left this ring behind him Would I or not Tell him I 'll none of it Desire him not to flatter with his lord Nor hold him up with hopes I am not for him If that the youth will come this way to morrow I 'll give him reasons for't Hie thee Malvolio Madam I will Exit I do I know not what and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind Fate show thy force ourselves we do not owe What is decreed must be and be this so Exit Will you stay no longer nor will you not that I go with you By your patience no My stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone It were a bad recompense for your love to lay any of them on you Let me know of you whither you are bound No sooth sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself You must know of me then Antonio my name is Sebastian which I call'd Roderigo my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of He left behind him myself and a sister both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleas'd would we had so ended But you sir alter'd that for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drown'd Alas the day A lady sir though it was said she much resembled me was yet of many accounted beautiful but though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that yet thus far I will boldly publish her she bore mind that envy could not but call fair She is drown'd already sir with salt water though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more Pardon me sir your bad entertainment O good Antonio forgive me your trouble If you will not murder me for my love let me be your servant If you will not undo what you have done- that is kill him whom you have recover'd desire it not Fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness and I am yet so near the manners of my mother that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me I am bound to the Count Orsino 's court Farewell The gentleness of all the gods go with thee I have many cnemies in Orsino 's court Else would I very shortly see thee there But come what may I do adore thee so That danger shall seem sport and I will go Exit Were you not ev'n now with the Countess Olivia Even now sir on a moderate pace I have since arriv'd but hither She returns this ring to you sir you might have saved me my pains to have taken it away yourself She adds moreover that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him And one thing more that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs unless it be to report your lord 's taking of this Receive it so She took the ring of me I 'll none of it Come sir you peevishly threw it to her and her will is it should be so return'd If it be worth stooping for there it lies in your eye if not be it his that finds it I left no ring with her what means this lady Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her She made good view of me indeed so much That methought her eyes had lost her tongue For she did speak in starts distractedly She loves me sure the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger None of my lord 's ring Why he sent her none I am the man If it be so- as ' tis- Poor lady she were better love a dream Disguise I see thou art a wickedness Wherein the pregnant enemy does much How easy is it for the proper false In women 's waxen hearts to set their forms Alas our frailty is the cause not we For such as we are made of such we be How will this fadge My master loves her dearly And I poor monster fond as much on him And she mistaken seems to dote on me What will become of this As I am man My state is desperate for my master 's love As I am woman- now alas the day!- What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe O Time thou must untangle this not I It is too hard a knot for me t ' untie Exit Approach Sir Andrew Not to be abed after midnight is to be up betimes and ' diluculo surgere ' thou know'st- Nay by my troth I know not but I know to be up late is to be up late A false conclusion I hate it as an unfill'd can To be up after midnight and to go to bed then is early so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes Does not our lives consist of the four elements Faith so they say but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking Th'art a scholar let us therefore eat and drink Marian I say a stoup of wine Here comes the fool i ' faith How now my hearts Did you never see the picture of ' we three ' Welcome ass Now let 's have a catch By my troth the fool has an excellent breast I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg and so sweet a breath to sing as the fool has In sooth thou wast

you out of doors never trust me My lady 's a Cataian we are politicians Malvolio 's a Peg a Ramsey and Sings Beshrew me the knight 's in admirable fooling Ay he does well enough if he be dispos'd and so do I too he does it with a better grace but I do it more natural Sings O ' the twelfth day of December- For the love o ' God peace My masters are you mad Or what are you Have you no wit manners nor honesty but to gabble like tinkers at this time of night Do ye make an ale house of my lady 's house that ye squeak out your coziers ' catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice Is there no respect of place persons nor time in you We did keep time sir in our catches Sneck up Sir Toby I must be round with you My lady bade me tell you that though she harbours you as her kins man she 's nothing allied to your disorders If you can separate yourself and your misdemeanours you are welcome to the house if not and it would please you to take leave of her she is very willing to bid you farewell Sings Farewell dear heart since I must needs be gone Nay good Sir Toby Sings His eyes do show his days are almost done Is't even so Sings But I will never die Falls down Sings Sir Toby there

than a steward Dost thou think because thou art virtuous there shall be no more cakes and ale Yes by Saint Anne and ginger shall be hot i ' th ' mouth too Mistress Mary if you priz'd my lady 's favour at anything more than contempt you would not give means for this uncivil rule she shall know of it by this hand Go shake your ears ' Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man 's ahungry to challenge him the field and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him Do't knight I 'll write thee a challenge or I 'll deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth Sweet Sir Toby be patient for to night since the youth of the Count 's was to day with my lady she is much out of quiet For Monsieur Malvolio let me alone with him if I do not gull him into a nayword and make him a common recreation do not think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed I know I can do it Possess us possess us tell us something of him Marry sir sometimes he is a kind of Puritan O if I thought that I 'd beat him like a dog What for being a Puritan Thy exquisite reason dear knight I have no exquisite reason for't but I have reason good enough The devil a Puritan that he is or anything constantly but a time pleaser an affection'd ass that cons state without book and What wilt thou do I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love wherein by the colour of his beard the shape of his leg the manner of his gait the expressure of his eye forehead and complexion he shall find himself most feelingly personated I can write very like my lady your niece on forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands Excellent I smell a device I have't in my nose too He shall think by the letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my niece and that she 's in love with him My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour And your horse now would make him an ass Ass I doubt not O ' twill be admirable Sport royal I warrant you I know my physic will work with him I will plant you two and let the fool make a third where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it For this night to bed and dream on the event Farewell Good night Penthesilea Before me she 's a good wench She 's a beagle true bred and one that adores me What o ' that I was ador'd once too Let 's to bed knight Thou hadst need send for more money If I can not recover your niece I am a foul way out Send for money knight if thou hast her not i ' th ' end call me Cut If I do not never trust me take it how you will Come come I 'll go burn some sack ' tis too late to go to bed now Come knight come knight Give me some music Now good morrow friends Now good Cesario but that piece of song That old and antique song we heard last night Methought it did relieve my passion much More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy paced times Come but one verse He is not here so please your lordship that should sing it Who was it Feste the jester my lord a fool that the Lady Olivia 's father took much delight in He is about the house Seek him out and play the tune the while It gives a very echo to the seat Where Love is thron'd Thou dost speak masterly My life upon't young though thou art thine eye Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves Hath it not boy A little by your favour What kind of woman is't Of your complexion She is not worth thee then What years i ' faith About your years my lord Too old by heaven Let still the woman take An elder than herself so wears she to him So sways she level in her husband 's heart For boy however we do praise ourselves Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm More longing wavering sooner lost and won Than women 's are I think it well my lord Then let thy love be younger than thyself Or thy affection can not hold the bent For women are as roses whose fair flow'r Being once display'd doth fall that very hour And so they are alas that they are so To die even when they to perfection grow O fellow come the song we had last night Mark it Cesario it is old and plain The spinsters and the knitters in the sun And the free maids that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it it is silly sooth And dallies with the innocence of love Like the old age Are you ready sir Ay prithee sing Music There 's for thy pains No pains sir I take pleasure in singing sir I 'll pay thy pleasure then Truly sir and pleasure will be paid one time or another Give me now leave to leave thee Now the melancholy god protect thee and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta for thy mind is a very opal I would have men of such constancy put to sea that their business might be everything and their intent everywhere for that 's it that always makes a good voyage of nothing Farewell Let all the rest give place But if she can not love you sir I can not be so answer'd Sooth but you must Say that some lady as perhaps there is Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia You can not love her You tell her so Must she not then be answer'd There is no woman 's sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart no woman 's heart So big to hold so much they lack retention Alas their love may be call'd appetite- No motion of the liver but the palate- That suffer surfeit cloyment and revolt But mine is all as hungry as the sea And can digest as much Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia Ay but I know- What dost thou know Too well what love women to men may owe In faith they are as true of heart as we My father had a daughter lov'd a man As it might be perhaps were I a woman I should your lordship And what 's her history A blank my lord She never told her love But let concealment like a worm i ' th ' bud Feed on her damask cheek She pin'd in thought And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like Patience on a monument Smiling at grief Was not this love indeed We men may say more swear more but indeed Our shows are more than will for still we prove Much in our vows but little in our love But died thy sister of her love my boy I am all the daughters of my father 's house And all the brothers too- and yet I know not Sir shall I to this lady Ay that 's the theme To her in haste Give her this jewel say My love can give no place bide no denay Exeunt Come thy ways Signior Fabian Nay I 'll come if I lose a scruple of this sport let me be boil'd to death with melancholy Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep biter come by some notable shame I would exult man you know he brought me out o ' favour with my lady about a bear baiting here To anger him we 'll have the bear again and we will fool him black and blue- shall we not Sir Andrew And we do not it is pity of our lives Here comes the little villain How now my metal of India Get ye all three into the box tree Malvolio 's coming down this walk He has been yonder i ' the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half hour Observe him for the love of mockery for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him Close in the name of jesting As the men hide she drops a letter Lie thou there for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling ' Tis but fortune all is fortune Maria once told me she did affect me and I have heard herself come thus near that should she fancy it should be one of my complexion Besides she uses me with a more exalted respect than any one else that follows her What should I think on't Here 's an overweening rogue O peace Contemplation makes a rare turkey cock of him how he jets under his advanc'd plumes ' Slight I could so beat the rogue- Peace I say To be Count Malvolio Ah rogue Pistol him pistol him Peace peace There is example for't the Lady of the Strachy married the yeoman of the wardrobe Fie on him Jezebel O peace Now he 's deeply in look how imagination blows him Having been three months married to her sitting in my state- O for a stone bow to hit him in the eye Calling my officers about me in my branch'd velvet gown having come from a day bed- where I have left Olivia sleeping- Fire and brimstone O peace peace And then to have the humour of state and after a demure travel of regard telling them I know my place as I would they should do theirs to ask for my kinsman Toby- Bolts and shackles O peace peace peace Now now Seven of my people with an obedient start make out for him I frown the while and perchance wind up my watch or play with my- some rich jewel Toby approaches curtsies there to me- Shall this fellow live Though our silence be drawn from us with cars yet peace I extend my hand to him thus quenching my familiar smile And does not Toby take you a blow o ' the lips then Saying ' Cousin Toby my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech'- What what ' You must amend your drunkenness'- Out scab Nay patience or we break the sinews of our plot ' Besides you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight'- That 's me I warrant you ' One Sir Andrew ' I knew ' twas I for many do call me fool What employment have we here Now is the woodcock near the gin O peace And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him By my life this is my lady 's hand these be her very C 's her U 's and her T 's and thus makes she her great P 's It is in contempt of question her hand Her C 's her U 's and her T 's Why that Reads ' To the unknown belov'd this and my good wishes ' Her very phrases By your leave wax Soft And the impressure her Lucrece with which she uses to seal ' tis my lady To whom should this be This wins him liver and all Reads Marry hang thee brock Reads A fustian riddle Excellent wench say I. ' M. O. A. I. doth sway my life ' Nay but first let me see let me see let me see What dish o ' poison has she dress'd him And with what wing the staniel checks at it ' I may command where I adore ' Why she may command me I serve her she is my lady Why this is evident to any formal capacity there is no obstruction in this And the end- what should that alphabetical position portend If I could make that resemble something in me Softly M. O. A. I.- O ay make up that He is now at a cold scent Sowter will cry upon't for all this though it be as rank as a fox M- Malvolio M- why that begins my name Did not I say he would work it out The cur is excellent at faults M- But then there is no consonancy in the sequel that suffers under probation A should follow but O does And O shall end I hope Ay or I 'll cudgel him and make him cry ' O ' And then I comes behind Ay an you had any eye behind you you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you M. O. A. I. This simulation is not as the former and yet to crush this a little it would bow to me for every one of these letters are in my name Soft here follows prose I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy I could marry this wench for this device So could I too And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest Nor I neither Here comes my noble gull catcher Wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck Or o ' mine either Shall I play my freedom at tray trip and become thy bond slave I ' faith or I either Why thou hast put him in such a dream that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad Nay but say true does it work upon him Like aqua vita with a midwife If you will then see the fruits of the sport mark his first approach before my lady He will come to her in yellow stockings and ' tis a colour she abhors and cross garter'd a fashion she detests and he will smile upon her which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition being addicted to a melancholy as she is that it can not but turn him into a notable contempt If you will see it follow me To the gates of Tartar thou most excellent devil of wit I 'll make one too Exeunt Save thee friend and thy music Dost thou live by thy tabor No sir I live by the church Art thou a churchman No such matter sir I do live by the church for I do live at my house and my house doth stand by the church So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar if a beggar dwell near him or the church stands by thy tabor if thy tabor stand by the church You have said sir To see this age A sentence is but a chev'ril glove to a good wit How quickly the wrong side may be turn'd outward Nay that 's certain they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton I would therefore my sister had had name sir Why man Why sir her name 's a word and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton But indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgrac'd them Thy reason man Troth sir I can yield you none without words and words are grown so false I am loath to prove reason with them I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car'st for nothing Not so sir I do care for something but in my conscience sir I do not care for you If that be to care for nothing sir I would it would make you invisible Art not thou the Lady Olivia 's fool No indeed sir the Lady Olivia has no folly she will keep no fool sir till she be married and fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings- the husband 's the bigger I am indeed not her fool but her corrupter of words I saw thee late at the Count Orsino 's Foolery sir does walk about the orb like the sun- it shines everywhere I would be sorry sir but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my mistress think I saw your wisdom there Nay an thou pass upon me I 'll no more with thee Hold there 's expenses for thee Giving a coin Now Jove in his next commodity of hair send the a beard By my troth I 'll tell thee I am almost sick for one Aside though I would not have it grow on my chin.- Is thy lady within Would not a pair of these have bred sir Yes being kept together and put to use I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir to bring a Cressida to this Troilus I understand you sir ' tis well begg'd The matter I hope is not great sir begging but a beggar Cressida was a beggar My lady is within sir I will construe to them whence you come who you are and what you would are out of my welkin- I might say ' element ' but the word is overworn This fellow is wise enough to play the fool And to do that well craves a kind of wit He must observe their mood on whom he jests The quality of persons and the time And like the haggard check at every feather That comes before his eye This is a practice As full of labour as a wise man 's art For folly that he wisely shows is fit But wise men folly fall'n quite taint their wit Save you gentleman And you sir Dieu vous garde monsieur Et vous aussi votre serviteur I hope sir you are and I am yours Will you encounter the house My niece is desirous you should enter if your trade be to her I am bound to your niece sir I mean she is the list of my voyage Taste your legs sir put them to motion My legs do better understand me sir than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs I mean to go sir to enter I will answer you with gait and entrance But we are prevented That youth 's a rare courtier- ' Rain odours ' well My matter hath no voice lady but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed car ' Odours ' ' pregnant ' and ' vouchsafed'- I 'll get 'em all

servant 's name fair Princess My servant sir ' Twas never merry world Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment Y'are servant to the Count Orsino youth And he is yours and his must needs be yours Your servant 's servant is your servant madam For him I think not on him for his thoughts Would they were blanks rather than fill'd with me Madam I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf O by your leave I pray you I bade you never speak again of him But would you undertake another suit I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres Dear lady- Give me leave beseech you I did send After the last enchantment you did here A ring in chase of you so did I abuse Myself my servant and I fear me you Under your hard construction must I sit To force that on you in a shameful cunning Which you knew none of yours What might you think Have you not set mine honour at the stake And baited it with all th ' unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think To one of your receiving Enough is shown a cypress not a bosom Hides my heart So let me hear you speak I Pity YOU That 's a degree to love No not a grize for ' tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies Why then methinks ' tis time to smile again O world how apt the poor are to be proud If one should be a prey how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf Clock strikes The clock upbraids me with the waste of time Be not afraid good youth I will not have you And yet when wit and youth is come to harvest Your wife is like to reap a proper man There lies your way due west Then westward ho Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship You 'll nothing madam to my lord by me Stay I prithee tell me what thou think'st of me That you do think you are not what you are If I think so I think the same of you Then think you right I am not what I am I would you were as I would have you be Would it be better madam than I am I wish it might for now I am your fool O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip A murd'rous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid love 's night is noon Cesario by the roses of the spring By maidhood honour truth and every thing I love thee so that maugre all thy pride Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide Do not extort thy reasons from this clause For that I woo thou therefore hast no cause But rather reason thus with reason fetter Love sought is good but given unsought is better By innocence I swear and by my youth I have one heart one bosom and one truth And that no woman has nor never none Shall mistress be of it save I alone And so adieu good madam never more Will I my master 's tears to you deplore Yet come again for thou perhaps mayst move That heart which now abhors to like his love Exeunt No faith I 'll not stay a jot longer Thy reason dear venom give thy reason You must needs yield your reason Sir Andrew Marry I saw your niece do more favours to the Count 's servingman than ever she bestow'd upon me I saw't i ' th ' orchard Did she see thee the while old boy Tell me that As plain as I see you now This was a great argument of love in her toward you ' Slight will you make an ass o ' me I will prove it legitimate sir upon the oaths of judgment and reason And they have been grand jurymen since before Noah was a sailor She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you to awake your dormouse valour to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver You should then have accosted her and with some excellent jests fire new from the mint you should have bang'd the youth into dumbness This was look'd for at your hand and this was baulk'd The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off and you are now sail'd into the north of my lady 's opinion where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman 's beard unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy An't be any way it must be with valour for policy I hate I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician Why then build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour Challenge me the Count 's youth to fight with him hurt him in eleven places My niece shall take note of it and assure thyself there is no love broker in the world can more prevail in man 's commendation with woman than report of valour There is no way but this Sir Andrew Will either of you bear me a challenge to him Go write it in a martial hand be curst and brief it is no matter how witty so it be eloquent and full of invention Taunt him with the license of ink if thou thou'st him some thrice it shall not be amiss and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England set 'em down go about it Let there be gall enough in thy ink though thou write with a goose pen no matter About it Where shall I find you We 'll call thee at the cubiculo Go This is a dear manakin to you Sir Toby I have been dear to him lad- some two thousand strong or so We shall have a rare letter from him but you 'll not deliver't Never trust me then and by all means stir on the youth to an answer I think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together For Andrew if he were open'd and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea I 'll eat the rest of th ' anatomy And his opposite the youth bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty Look where the youngest wren of nine comes If you desire the spleen and will laugh yourselves into stitches follow me Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen a very renegado for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness He 's in yellow stockings And cross garter'd Most villainously like a pedant that keeps a school i ' th ' church I have dogg'd him like his murderer He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp'd to betray him He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies You have not seen such a thing as ' tis I can hardly forbear hurling things at him I know my lady will strike him if she do he 'll smile and take't for a great favour Come bring us bring us where he is Exeunt I would not by my will have troubled you But since you make your pleasure of your pains I will no further chide you I could not stay behind you my desire More sharp than filed steel did spur me forth And not all love to see you- though so much As might have drawn one to a longer voyage- But jealousy what might befall your travel Being skilless in these parts which to a stranger Unguided and unfriended often prove Rough and unhospitable My willing love The rather by these arguments of fear Set forth in your pursuit My kind Antonio I can no other answer make but thanks And thanks and ever thanks and oft good turns Are shuffl'd off with such uncurrent pay But were my worth as is my conscience firm You should find better dealing What 's to do Shall we go see the reliques of this town To morrow sir best first go see your lodging I am not weary and ' tis long to night I pray you let us satisfy our eyes With the memorials and the things of fame That do renown this city Would you 'd pardon me I do not without danger walk these streets Once in a sea fight ' gainst the Count his galleys I did some service of such note indeed That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd Belike you slew great number of his people Th ' offence is not of such a bloody nature Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument It might have since been answer'd in repaying What we took from them which for traffic 's sake Most of our city did Only myself stood out For which if I be lapsed in this place I shall pay dear Do not then walk too open It doth not fit me Hold sir here 's my purse In the south suburbs at the Elephant Is best to lodge I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town there shall you have me Why I your purse Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase and your store I think is not for idle markets sir I 'll be your purse bearer and leave you for An hour To th ' Elephant I do remember Exeunt I have sent after him he says he 'll come How shall I feast him What bestow of him For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd I speak too loud Where 's Malvolio He is sad and civil And suits well for a servant with my fortunes Where is Malvolio He 's coming madam but in very strange manner He is sure possess'd madam Why what 's the matter Does he rave No madam he does nothing but smile Your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come for sure the man is tainted in 's wits Go call him hither Exit MARIA I am as mad as he If sad and merry madness equal be Sweet lady ho ho Smil'st thou I sent for thee upon a sad occasion Sad lady I could be sad This does make some obstruction in the blood this cross gartering but what of that If it please the eye of one it is with me as the very true sonnet is ' Please one and please all ' Why how dost thou man What is the matter with thee Not black in my mind though yellow in my legs It did come to his hands and commands shall be executed I think we do know the sweet Roman hand Wilt thou go to bed Malvolio To bed Ay sweetheart and I 'll come to thee God comfort thee Why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft How do you Malvolio At your request Yes nightingales answer daws Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ' Be not afraid of greatness ' ' Twas well writ What mean'st thou by that Malvolio ' Some are born great,'- Ha ' Some achieve greatness,'- What say'st thou ' And some have greatness thrust upon them ' Heaven restore thee ' Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'- ' Thy yellow stockings ' ' And wish'd to see thee cross garterd ' ' Cross garter'd ' ' Go to thou an made if thou desir'st to be so';- Am I made ' If not let me see thee a servant still ' Why this is very midsummer madness Madam the young gentleman of the Count Orsino 's is return'd I could hardly entreat him back he attends your ladyship 's pleasure I 'll come to him Exit SERVANT Good Maria let this fellow be look'd to Where 's my cousin Toby Let some of my people have a special care of him I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry O ho do you come near me now No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me This concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose that I may appear stubborn to him for she incites me to that in the letter ' Cast thy humble slough ' says she ' Be opposite with kinsman surly with servants let thy tongue tang with arguments of state put thyself into the trick of singularity ' and consequently sets down the manner how as a sad face a reverend carriage a slow tongue in the habit of some sir of note and so forth I have lim'd her but it is Jove 's doing and Jove make me thankful And when she went away now- ' Let this fellow be look'd to ' ' Fellow ' not ' Malvolio ' nor after my degree but ' fellow ' Why everything adheres together that no dram of a scruple no scruple of a scruple no obstacle no incredulous or unsafe circumstance- What can be said Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes Well Jove not I is the doer of this and he is to be thanked Which way is he in the name of sanctity If all the devils of hell be drawn in little and Legion himself possess'd him yet I 'll speak to him Here he is here he is How is't with you sir How is't with you man Go off I discard you Let me enjoy my private go off Lo how hollow the fiend speaks within him Did not I tell you Sir Toby my lady prays you to have a care of him Ah ha does she so Go to go to peace peace we must deal gently with him Let me alone How do you Malvolio How is't with you What man defy the devil consider he 's an enemy to mankind Do you know what you say La you an you speak ill of the devil how he takes it at heart Pray God he be not bewitched Carry his water to th ' wise woman Marry and it shall be done to morrow morning if I live My lady would not lose him for more than I 'll say How now mistress O Lord Prithee hold thy peace this is not the way Do you not see you move him Let me alone with him No way but gentleness- gently gently The fiend is rough and will not be roughly us'd Why how now my bawcock How dost thou chuck Sir Ay Biddy come with me What man ' tis not for gravity to play at cherrypit with Satan Hang him foul collier Get him to say his prayers good Sir Toby get him to pray My prayers minx No I warrant you he will not hear of godliness Go hang yourselves all You are idle shallow things I am not of your element you shall know more hereafter Is't possible If this were play'd upon a stage now I could condemn it as an improbable fiction His very genius hath taken the infection of the device man Nay pursue him now lest the device take air and taint Why we shall make him mad indeed The house will be the quieter Come we 'll have him in a dark room and bound My niece is already in the belief that he 's mad We may carry it thus for our pleasure and his penance till our very pastime tired out of breath prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen But see but see More matter for a May morning Here 's the challenge read it I warrant there 's vinegar and pepper in't Is't so saucy Ay is't I warrant him do but read Give me Reads ' Youth whatsoever thou art thou art but a scurvy fellow ' Good and valiant Reads ' Wonder not nor admire not in thy mind why I do call thee so for I will show thee no reason for't ' A good note that keeps you from the blow of the law Reads ' Thou com'st to the Lady Olivia and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat that is not the matter I challenge thee for ' Very brief and to exceeding good sense- less Reads ' I will waylay thee going home where if it be thy chance to kill me'- Good ' Thou kill'st me like a rogue and a villain ' Still you keep o ' th ' windy side of the law Good Reads ' Fare thee well and God have mercy upon one of our souls He may have mercy upon mine but my hope is better and so look to thyself Thy friend as thou usest him and thy sworn enemy You may have very fit occasion for't he is now in some commerce with my lady and will by and by depart Go Sir Andrew scout me for him at the corner of the orchard like a bum baily so soon as ever thou seest him draw and as thou draw'st swear horrible for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath with a swaggering accent sharply twang'd off gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earn'd him Away Nay let me alone for swearing Exit Now will not I deliver his letter for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less Therefore this letter being so excellently ignorant will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole But sir I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour and drive the gentleman- as know his youth will aptly receive it- into a most hideous opinion of his rage skill fury and impetuosity This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look like cockatrices Here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave and presently after him I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge I have said too much unto a heart of stone And laid mine honour too unchary out There 's something in me that reproves my fault But such a headstrong potent fault it is That it but mocks reproof With the same haviour that your passion bears Goes on my master 's griefs Here wear this jewel for me ' tis my picture Refuse it not it hath no tongue to vex you And I beseech you come again to morrow What shall you ask of me that I 'll deny That honour sav'd may upon asking give Nothing but this- your true love for my master How with mine honour may I give him that Which I have given to you I will acquit you Well come again to morrow Fare thee well A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell Exit Gentleman God save thee And you sir That defence thou hast betake thee tot Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him I know not but thy intercepter full of despite bloody as the hunter attends thee at the orchard end Dismount thy tuck be yare in thy preparation for thy assailant is quick skilful and deadly You mistake sir I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man You 'll find it otherwise I assure you therefore if you hold your life at any price betake you to your guard for your opposite hath in him what youth strength skill and wrath can furnish man withal I pray you sir what is he He is knight dubb'd with unhatch'd rapier and on carpet consideration but he is a devil in private brawl Souls and bodies hath he divorc'd three and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre Hob nob is his word- give't or take't I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady I am no fighter I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk Sir no his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore get you on and give him his desire Back you shall not to the house unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore on or strip your sword stark naked for meddle you must that 's certain or forswear to wear iron about you This is as uncivil as strange I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is it is something of my negligence nothing of my purpose I Will do so Signior Fabian stay you by this gentleman till my return Exit SIR TOBY Pray you sir do you know of this matter I know the knight is incens'd against you even to a mortal arbitrement but nothing of the circumstance more I beseech you what manner of man is he Nothing of that wonderful promise to read him by his form as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour He is indeed sir the most skilful bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria Will you walk towards him I will make your peace with him if I can I shall be much bound to you for't I am one that would rather go with sir priest than sir knight I care not who knows so much of my mettle Exeunt Why man he 's a very devil I have not seen such a firago I had a pass with him rapier scabbard and all and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable and on the answer he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on They say he has been fencer to the Sophy Pox on't I 'll not meddle with him Ay but he will not now be pacified Fabian can scarce hold him yonder Plague on't an I thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence I 'd have seen him damn'd ere I 'd have challeng'd him Let him let the matter slip and I 'll give him my horse grey Capilet I 'll make the motion Stand here make a good show on't this shall end without the perdition of souls Aside Marry I 'll ride your horse as well as I ride you To SIR TOBY He is as horribly conceited of him and pants To VIOLA There 's no remedy sir he will fight with you for 's oath sake Marry he hath better bethought him of his quarrel and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of Therefore draw for the supportance of his vow he protests he will not hurt you Aside Pray God defend me A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man Give ground if you see him furious Come Sir Andrew there 's no remedy the gentleman will for his honour 's sake have one bout with you he can not by the duello avoid it but he has promis'd me as he is a gentleman and a soldier he will not hurt you Come on to't Pray God he keep his oath They draw I do assure you ' tis against my will Put up your sword If this young gentleman Have done offence I take the fault on me If you offend him I for him defy you You sir Why what are you One sir that for his love dares yet do more Than you have heard him brag to you he will Nay if you be an undertaker I am for you O good Sir Toby hold Here come the officers To ANTONIO I 'll be with you anon Pray sir put your sword up if you please Marry will I sir and for that I promis'd you I 'll be as good as my word He will bear you easily and reins well This is the man do thy office Antonio I arrest thee at the suit Of Count Orsino You do mistake me sir No sir no jot I know your favour well Though now you have no sea cap on your head Take him away he knows I know him well I Must obey To VIOLA This comes with seeking you But there 's no remedy I shall answer it What will you do now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse It grieves me Much more for what I can not do for you Than what befalls myself You stand amaz'd But be of comfort Come sir away I must entreat of you some of that money What money sir For the fair kindness you have show'd me here And part being prompted by your present trouble Out of my lean and low ability I 'll lend you something My having is not much I 'll make division of my present with you Hold there 's half my coffer Will you deny me now Is't possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion Do not tempt my misery Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you I know of none Nor know I you by voice or any feature I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying vainness babbling drunkenness Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood O heavens themselves Come sir I pray you go Let me speak a little This youth that you see here I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death Reliev'd him with such sanctity of love And to his image which methought did promise Most venerable worth did I devotion What 's that to us The time goes by away But O how vile an idol proves this god Thou hast Sebastian done good feature shame In nature there 's no blemish but the mind None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind Virtue is beauty but the beauteous evil Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil The man grows mad Away with him Come come sir Lead me on Exit with OFFICERS Methinks his words do from such passion fly That he believes himself so do not I. Prove true imagination O prove true That I dear brother be now ta'en for you Come hither knight come hither Fabian we 'll whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws He nam'd Sebastian I my brother know Yet living in my glass even such and so In favour was my brother and he went Still in this fashion colour ornament For him I imitate O if it prove Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love Exit A very dishonest paltry boy and more a coward than a hare His dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him and for his cowardship ask Fabian A coward a most devout coward religious in it ' Slid I 'll after him again and beat him Do cuff him soundly but never draw thy sword And I do not- Exit Come let 's see the event I dare lay any money ' twill be nothing yet Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you Go to go to thou art a foolish fellow let me be clear of thee Well held out i ' faith No I do not know you nor I am not sent to you by my lady to bid you come speak with her nor your name is not Master Cesario nor this is not my nose neither Nothing that is so is so I prithee vent thy folly somewhere else Thou know'st not me Vent my folly He has heard that word of some great man and now applies it to a fool Vent my folly I am afraid this great lubber the world will prove a cockney I prithee now ungird thy strangeness and tell me

thee and there and there Are all the people mad Hold sir or I 'll throw your dagger o'er the house This will I tell my lady straight I would not be in some of your coats for two pence Exit Come on sir hold Nay let him alone I 'll go another way to work with him I 'll have an action of battery against him if there be any law in Illyria though I struck him first yet it 's no matter for that Let go thy hand Come sir I will not let you go Come my young soldier put up your iron you are well flesh'd Come on I will be free from thee What wouldst thou now If thou dar'st tempt me further draw thy sword Draws What what Nay then I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you Draws Hold Toby on thy life I charge thee hold Madam Will it be ever thus Ungracious wretch Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves Where manners ne'er were preach'd Out of my sight Be not offended dear Cesario- Rudesby be gone What relish is in this How runs the stream Or I am mad or else this is a dream Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep If it be thus to dream still let me sleep Nay come I prithee Would thou'dst be rul'd by me Madam I will O say so and so be Exeunt Nay I prithee put on this gown and this beard make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate do it quickly I 'll call Sir Toby the whilst Exit Well I 'll put it on and I will dissemble myself in't and I would I were the first that ever dissembled in such a gown I am not tall enough to become the function well nor lean enough to be thought a good student but to be said an honest man and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a careful man and a great scholar The competitors enter Jove bless thee Master Parson Bonos dies Sir Toby for as the old hermit of Prague that never saw pen and ink very wittily said

thou this man Talkest thou nothing but of ladies Well said Master Parson Sir Topas never was man thus wronged Good Sir Topas do not think I am mad they have laid me here in hideous darkness Fie thou dishonest Satan I call thee by the most modest terms for I am one of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy Say'st thou that house is dark As hell Sir Topas Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes and the clerestories toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony and yet complainest thou of obstruction I am not mad Sir Topas I say to you this house is dark Madman thou errest I say there is no darkness but ignorance in which thou art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog I say this house is as dark as ignorance though ignorance were as dark as hell and I say there was never man thus abus'd I am no more mad than you are make the trial of it in any constant question What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird What think'st thou of his opinion I think nobly of the soul and no way approve his opinion Fare thee well Remain thou still in darkness thou shalt Sir Topas Sir Topas My most exquisite Sir Topas Nay I am for all waters Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown he sees thee not To him in thine own voice and bring me word how thou find'st him I would we were well rid of this knavery If he may be conveniently deliver'd I would he were for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I can not pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot

Good fool as ever thou wilt deserve well at my hand help me to a candle and pen ink and paper as I am a gentleman I will live to be thankful to thee for't Master Malvolio Ay good fool Alas sir how fell you besides your five wits Fool there was never man so notoriously abus'd I am as well in my wits fool as thou art But as well Then you are mad indeed if you be no better in your wits than a fool They have here propertied me keep me in darkness send ministers to me asses and do all they can to face me out of my wits Advise you what you say the minister is here Speaking as SIR TOPAS Malvolio

fetch you light and paper and ink Fool I 'll requite it in the highest degree I prithe be gone Singing This is the air that is the glorious sun This pearl she gave me I do feel't and see't And though ' tis wonder that enwraps me thus Yet ' tis not madness Where 's Antonio then I could not find him at the Elephant Yet there he was and there I found this credit That he did range the town to seek me out His counsel now might do me golden service For though my soul disputes well with my sense That this may be some error but no madness Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune So far exceed all instance all discourse That I am ready to distrust mine eyes And wrangle with my reason that persuades me To any other trust but that I am mad Or else the lady 's mad yet if ' twere so She could not sway her house command her followers Take and give back affairs and their dispatch With such a smooth discreet and stable bearing As I perceive she does There 's something in't That is deceivable But here the lady comes Blame not this haste of mine If you mean well Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by there before him And underneath that consecrated roof Plight me the fun assurance of your faith That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth What do you say I 'll follow this good man and go with you And having sworn truth ever will be true Then lead the way good father and heavens so shine That they may fairly note this act of mine Exeunt Now as thou lov'st me let me see his letter Good Master Fabian grant me another request Anything Do not desire to see this letter This is to give a dog and in recompense desire my dog again Belong you to the Lady Olivia friends Ay sir we are some of her trappings I know thee well How dost thou my good fellow Truly sir the better for my foes and the worse for my friends Just the contrary the better for thy friends No sir the worse How can that be Marry sir they praise me and make an ass of me Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass so that by my foes sir I profit in the knowledge of myself and by my friends I am abused so that conclusions to be as kisses if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then the worse for my friends and the better for my foes Why this is excellent By my troth sir no though it please you to be one of my friends Thou shalt not be the worse for me There 's gold But that it would be double dealing sir I would you could make it another O you give me ill counsel Put your grace in your pocket sir for this once and let your flesh and blood obey it Well I will be so much a sinner to be a double dealer There 's another Primo secundo tertio is a good play and the old saying is ' The third pays for all ' The triplex sir is a good tripping measure or the bells of Saint Bennet sir may put you in mind- one two three You can fool no more money out of me at this throw if you will let your lady know I am here to speak with her and bring her along with you it may awake my bounty further Marry sir lullaby to your bounty till I come again I go sir but I would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness But as you say sir let your bounty take a nap I will awake it anon Exit Here comes the man sir that did rescue me That face of his I do remember well Yet when I saw it last it was besmear'd As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war A baubling vessel was he captain of For shallow draught and bulk unprizable With which such scathful grapple did he make With the most noble bottom of our fleet That very envy and the tongue of los Cried fame and honour on him What 's the matter Orsino this is that Antonio That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy And this is he that did the Tiger board When your young nephew Titus lost his leg Here in the streets desperate of shame and state In private brabble did we apprehend him He did me kindness sir drew on my side But in conclusion put strange speech upon me I know not what ' twas but distraction Notable pirate thou salt water thief What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies Whom thou in terms so bloody and so dear Hast made thine enemies Orsino noble sir Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you give me Antonio never yet was thief or pirate Though I confess on base and ground enough Orsino 's enemy A witchcraft drew me hither That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea 's enrag'd and foamy mouth Did I redeem a wreck past hope he was His life I gave him and did thereto ad My love without retention or restraint All his in dedication for his sake Did I expose myself pure for his love Into the danger of this adverse town Drew to defend him when he was beset Where being apprehended his false cunning Not meaning to partake with me in danger Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance And grew a twenty years removed thing While one would wink denied me mine own purse Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before How can this be When came he to this town To day my lord and for three months before No int'rim not a minute 's vacancy Both day and night did we keep company Here comes the Countess now heaven walks on earth But for thee fellow- fellow thy words are madness Three months this youth hath tended upon me- But more of that anon Take him aside What would my lord but that he may not have Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable Cesario you do not keep promise with me Madam Gracious Olivia- What do you say Cesario Good my lord- My lord would speak my duty hushes me If it be aught to the old tune my lord It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music Still so cruel Still so constant lord What to perverseness You uncivil lady To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull'st off'rings hath breath'd out That e'er devotion tender'd What shall I do Even what it please my lord that shall become him Why should I not had I the heart to do it Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death Kill what I love?- a savage jealousy That sometime savours nobly But hear me this Since you to non regardance cast my faith And that I partly know the instrument That screws me from my true place in your favour Live you the marble breasted tyrant still But this your minion whom I know you love And whom by heaven I swear I tender dearly Him will I tear out of that cruel eye Where he sits crowned in his master 's spite Come boy with me my thoughts are ripe in mischief I 'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love To spite a raven 's heart within a dove And I most jocund apt and willingly To do you rest a thousand deaths would die Where goes Cesario After him I love More than I love these eyes more than my life More by all mores than e'er I shall love wife If I do feign you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love Ay me detested How am I beguil'd Who does beguile you Who does do you wrong Hast thou forgot thyself Is it so long Call forth the holy father Exit an ATTENDANT Come away Whither my lord Cesario husband stay Husband Ay husband can he that deny Her husband sirrah No my lord not I. Alas it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety Fear not Cesario take thy fortunes up Be that thou know'st thou art and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st A contract of eternal bond of love Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands Attested by the holy close of lips Strength'ned by interchangement of your rings And all the ceremony of this compact Seal'd in my function by my testimony Since when my watch hath told me toward my grave I have travell'd but two hours O thou dissembling cub What wilt thou be When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow Farewell and take her but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet My lord I do protest- O do not swear Hold little faith though thou has too much fear For the love of God a surgeon Send one presently to Sir Toby What 's the matter Has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too For the love of God your help I had rather than forty pound I were at home Who has done this Sir Andrew The Count 's gentleman one Cesario We took him for a coward but he 's the very devil incardinate My gentleman Cesario Od 's lifelings here he is You broke my head for nothing and that that did I was set on to do't by Sir Toby Why do you speak to me I never hurt you You drew your sword upon me without cause But I bespake you fair and hurt you not If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt you have hurt me I think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb Here comes Sir Toby halting you shall hear more but if he had not been in drink he would have tickl'd you othergates than he did How now gentleman How is't with you That 's all one has hurt me and there 's th ' end on't Sot didst see Dick Surgeon sot O he 's drunk Sir Toby an hour agone his eyes were set at eight i ' th ' morning Then he 's a rogue and a passy measures pavin I hate a drunken rogue Away with him Who hath made this havoc with them I 'll help you Sir Toby because we 'll be dress'd together Will you help- an ass head and a coxcomb and a knave a thin fac'd knave a gull Get him to bed and let his hurt be look'd to I am sorry madam I have hurt your kinsman But had it been the brother of my blood I must have done no less with wit and safety You throw a strange regard upon me and by that I do perceive it hath offended you Pardon me sweet one even for the vows We made each other but so late ago One face one voice one habit and two persons A natural perspective that is and is not Antonio O my dear Antonio How have the hours rack'd and tortur'd me Since I have lost thee Sebastian are you Fear'st thou that Antonio How have you made division of yourself An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures Which is Sebastian Most wonderful Do I stand there I never had a brother Nor can there be that deity in my nature Of here and everywhere I had a sister Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd Of charity what kin are you to me What countryman what name what parentage Of Messaline Sebastian was my father Such a Sebastian was my brother too So went he suited to his watery tomb If spirits can assume both form and suit You come to fright us A spirit I am indeed But am in that dimension grossly clad Which from the womb I did participate Were you a woman as the rest goes even I should my tears let fall upon your cheek And say ' Thrice welcome drowned Viola ' My father had a mole upon his brow And so had mine And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numb'red thirteen years O that record is lively in my soul He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurp'd attire Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place time fortune do cohere and jump That I am Viola which to confirm I 'll bring you to a captain in this town Where lie my maiden weeds by whose gentle help I was preserv'd to serve this noble Count All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord To OLIVIA So Comes it lady you have been mistook But nature to her bias drew in that You would have been contracted to a maid Nor are you therein by my life deceiv'd You are betroth'd both to a maid and man Be not amaz'd right noble is his blood If this be so as yet the glass seems true I shall have share in this most happy wreck To VIOLA Boy thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me And all those sayings will I overswear And all those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbed continent the fire That severs day from night Give me thy hand And let me see thee in thy woman 's weeds The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid 's garments He upon some action Is now in durance at Malvolio 's suit A gentleman and follower of my lady 's He shall enlarge him Fetch Malvolio hither And yet alas now I remember me They say poor gentleman he 's much distract Truly madam he holds Belzebub at the stave 's end as well as a man in his case may do Has here writ a letter to you I should have given ' t you to day morning but as a madman 's epistles are no gospels so it skills not much when they are deliver'd Open't and read it Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman Reads madly ' By the Lord madam- ' How now Art thou mad No madam I do but read madness An your ladyship will have it as it ought to be you must allow vox Prithee read i ' thy right wits So I do madonna but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend my Princess and give ear To FABIAN Read it you sirrah Reads ' By the Lord madam you wrong me and the world shall know it Though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship I have your own letter that induced me to the semblance I put on with the which I doubt not but to do myself much right or you much shame Think of me as you please I leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury Did he write this Ay Madam This savours not much of distraction See him deliver'd Fabian bring him hither Madam I am most apt t ' embrace your offer To VIOLA Your master quits you and for your service done A sister You are she Is this the madman Ay my lord this same How now Malvolio Madam you have done me wrong Notorious wrong Have I Malvolio No Lady you have Pray you peruse that letter You must not now deny it is your hand Write from it if you can in hand or phrase Or say ' tis not your seal not your invention You can say none of this Well grant it then And tell me in the modesty of honour Why you have given me such clear lights of favour Bade me come smiling and cross garter'd to you To put on yellow stockings and to frown Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people And acting this in an obedient hope Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd Kept in a dark house visited by the priest And made the most notorious geck and gul That e'er invention play'd on Tell me why Alas Malvolio this is not my writing Though I confess much like the character But out of question ' tis Maria 's hand And now I do bethink me it was she First told me thou wast mad then cam'st in smiling And in such forms which here were presuppos'd Upon thee in the letter Prithee be content This practice hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee But when we know the grounds and authors of it Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause Good madam hear me speak And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come Taint the condition of this present hour Which I have wond'red at In hope it shall not Most freely I confess myself and Toby Set this device against Malvolio here Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts We had conceiv'd against him Maria writ The letter at Sir Toby 's great importance In recompense whereof he hath married her How with a sportful malice it was follow'd May rather pluck on laughter than revenge If that the injuries be justly weigh'd That have on both sides pass'd Alas poor fool how have they baffl'd thee Why ' Some are born great some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrown upon them ' I was one sir in this interlude- one Sir Topas sir but that 's all one ' By the Lord fool I am not mad ' But do you remember- ' Madam why laugh you at such a barren rascal An you smile not he 's gagg'd ' And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges I 'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you He hath been most notoriously abus'd Pursue him and entreat him to a peace He hath not told us of the captain yet When that is known and golden time convents A solemn combination shall be made Of our dear souls Meantime sweet sister We will not part from hence Cesario come For so you shall be while you are a man But when in other habits you are seen Orsino 's mistress and his fancy 's queen Cease to persuade my loving Proteus Home keeping youth have ever homely wits Were't not affection chains thy tender days To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love I rather would entreat thy company To see the wonders of the world abroad Than living dully sluggardiz'd at home Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness But since thou lov'st love still and thrive therein Even as I would when I to love begin Wilt thou be gone Sweet Valentine adieu Think on thy Proteus when thou haply seest Some rare noteworthy object in thy travel Wish me partaker in thy happiness When thou dost meet good hap and in thy danger If ever danger do environ thee Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers For I will be thy headsman Valentine And on a love book pray for my success Upon some book I love I 'll pray for thee That 's on some shallow story of deep love How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont That 's a deep story of a deeper love For he was more than over shoes in love ' Tis true for you are over boots in love And yet you never swum the Hellespont Over the boots Nay give me not the boots No I will not for it boots thee not What To be in love- where scorn is bought with groans Coy looks with heart sore sighs one fading moment 's mirth With twenty watchful weary tedious nights If haply won perhaps a hapless gain If lost why then a grievous labour won However but a folly bought with wit Or else a wit by folly vanquished So by your circumstance you call me fool So by your circumstance I fear you 'll prove ' Tis love you cavil at I am not Love Love is your master for he masters you And he that is so yoked by a fool Methinks should not be chronicled for wise Yet writers say as in the sweetest bud The eating canker dwells so eating love Inhabits in the finest wits of all And writers say as the most forward bud Is eaten by the canker ere it blow Even so by love the young and tender wit Is turn'd to folly blasting in the bud Losing his verdure even in the prime And all the fair effects of future hopes But wherefore waste I time to counsel the That art a votary to fond desire Once more adieu My father at the road Expects my coming there to see me shipp'd And thither will I bring thee Valentine Sweet Proteus no now let us take our leave To Milan let me hear from thee by letters Of thy success in love and what news else Betideth here in absence of thy friend And I likewise will visit thee with mine All happiness bechance to thee in Milan As much to you at home and so farewell He after honour hunts I after love He leaves his friends to dignify them more I leave myself my friends and all for love Thou Julia thou hast metamorphis'd me Made me neglect my studies lose my time War with good counsel set the world at nought Made wit with musing weak heart sick with thought Sir Proteus save you Saw you my master But now he parted hence to embark for Milan Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already And I have play'd the sheep in losing him Indeed a sheep doth very often stray An if the shepherd be awhile away You conclude that my master is a shepherd then and I a sheep I do Why then my horns are his horns whether I wake or sleep A silly answer and fitting well a sheep This proves me still a sheep True and thy master a shepherd Nay that I can deny by a circumstance It shall go hard but I 'll prove it by another The shepherd seeks the sheep and not the sheep the shepherd but I seek my master and my master seeks not me therefore I am no sheep The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master thy master for wages follows not thee Therefore thou art a sheep Such another proof will make me cry ' baa ' But dost thou hear Gav'st thou my letter to Julia Ay sir I a lost mutton gave your letter to her a lac'd mutton and she a lac'd mutton gave me a lost mutton nothing for my labour Here 's too small a pasture for such store of muttons If the ground be overcharg'd you were best stick her Nay in that you are astray ' twere best pound you Nay sir less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter You mistake I mean the pound- a pinfold From a pound to a pin Fold it over and over ' Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover But what said she Nodding Ay Nod- ay Why that 's ' noddy ' You mistook sir I say she did nod and you ask me if she did nod and I say ' Ay ' And that set together is ' noddy ' Now you have taken the pains to set it together take it for your pains No no you shall have it for bearing the letter Well I perceive I must be fain to bear with you Why sir how do you bear with me Marry sir the letter very orderly having nothing but the word ' noddy ' for my pains Beshrew me but you have a quick wit And yet it can not overtake your slow purse Come come open the matter in brief what said she Open your purse that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered Well sir here is for your pains What said she Truly sir I think you 'll hardly win her Why couldst thou perceive so much from her Sir I could perceive nothing at all from her no not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind I fear she 'll prove as hard to you in telling your mind Give her no token but stones for she 's as hard as steel What said she Nothing No not so much as ' Take this for thy pains ' To testify your bounty I thank you you have testern'd me in requital whereof henceforth carry your letters yourself and so sir I 'll commend you to my master Go go be gone to save your ship from wreck Which can not perish having thee aboard Being destin'd to a drier death on shore Exit SPEED I must go send some better messenger I fear my Julia would not deign my lines Receiving them from such a worthless post Exit But say Lucetta now we are alone Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love Ay madam so you stumble not unheedfully Of all the fair resort of gentlemen That every day with parle encounter me In thy opinion which is worthiest love Please you repeat their names I 'll show my mind According to my shallow simple skill What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour As of a knight well spoken neat and fine But were I you he never should be mine What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio Well of his wealth but of himself so so What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus Lord Lord to see what folly reigns in us How now what means this passion at his name Pardon dear madam ' tis a passing shame That I unworthy body as I am Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen Why not on Proteus as of all the rest Then thus of many good I think him best Your reason I have no other but a woman 's reason I think him so because I think him so And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him Ay if you thought your love not cast away Why he of all the rest hath never mov'd me Yet he of all the rest I think best loves ye His little speaking shows his love but small Fire that 's closest kept burns most of all They do not love that do not show their love O they love least that let men know their love I would I knew his mind Peruse this paper madam ' To Julia'- Say from whom That the contents will show Say say who gave it thee Sir Valentine 's page and sent I think from Proteus He would have given it you but I being in the way Did in your name receive it pardon the fault I pray Now by my modesty a goodly broker Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines To whisper and conspire against my youth Now trust me ' tis an office of great worth And you an officer fit for the place There take the paper see it be return'd Or else return no more into my sight To plead for love deserves more fee than hate Will ye be gone That you may ruminate Exit And yet I would I had o'erlook'd the letter It were a shame to call her back again And pray her to a fault for which I chid her What fool is she that knows I am a maid And would not force the letter to my view Since maids in modesty say ' No ' to that Which they would have the profferer construe ' Ay ' Fie fie how wayward is this foolish love That like a testy babe will scratch the nurse And presently all humbled kiss the rod How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence When willingly I would have had her here How angerly I taught my brow to frown When inward joy enforc'd my heart to smile My penance is to call Lucetta back And ask remission for my folly past What ho Lucetta What would your ladyship Is't near dinner time I would it were That you might kill your stomach on your meat And not upon your maid What is't that you took up so gingerly Nothing Why didst thou stoop then To take a paper up that I let fall And is that paper nothing Nothing concerning me Then let it lie for those that it concerns Madam it will not lie where it concerns Unless it have a false interpreter Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme That I might sing it madam to a tune Give me a note your ladyship can set As little by such toys as may be possible Best sing it to the tune of ' Light o ' Love ' It is too heavy for so light a tune Heavy belike it hath some burden then Ay and melodious were it would you sing it And why not you I can not reach so high Let 's see your song LUCETTA withholds the letter How now minion Keep tune there still so you will sing it out And yet methinks I do not like this tune You do not No madam ' tis too sharp You minion are too saucy Nay now you are too flat And mar the concord with too harsh a descant There wanteth but a mean to fill your song The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass Indeed I bid the base for Proteus This babble shall not henceforth trouble me Here is a coil with protestation Tears the letter Go get you gone and let the papers lie You would be fing'ring them to anger me She makes it strange but she would be best pleas'd To be so ang'red with another letter Exit Nay would I were so ang'red with the same O hateful hands to tear such loving words Injurious wasps to feed on such sweet honey And kill the bees that yield it with your stings I 'll kiss each several paper for amends Look here is writ ' kind Julia ' Unkind Julia As in revenge of thy ingratitude I throw thy name against the bruising stones Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain And here is writ ' love wounded Proteus ' Poor wounded name my bosom,,as a bed Shall lodge thee till thy wound be throughly heal'd And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss But twice or thrice was ' Proteus ' written down Be calm good wind blow not a word away Till I have found each letter in the letter- Except mine own name that some whirlwind bear Unto a ragged fearful hanging rock And throw it thence into the raging sea Lo here in one line is his name twice writ ' Poor forlorn Proteus passionate Proteus To the sweet Julia ' That I 'll tear away And yet I will not sith so prettily He couples it to his complaining names Thus will I fold them one upon another Now kiss embrace contend do what you will Madam Dinner is ready and your father stays Well let us go What shall these papers lie like tell tales here If you respect them best to take them up Nay I was taken up for laying them down Yet here they shall not lie for catching cold I see you have a month 's mind to them Ay madam you may say what sights you see I see things too although you judge I wink Come come will't please you go Exeunt Tell me Panthino what sad talk was that Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister ' Twas of his nephew Proteus your son Why what of him He wond'red that your lordship Would suffer him to spend his youth at home While other men of slender reputation Put forth their sons to seek preferment out Some to the wars to try their fortune there Some to discover islands far away Some to the studious universities For any or for all these exercises He said that Proteus your son was meet And did request me to importune you To let him spend his time no more at home Which would be great impeachment to his age In having known no travel in his youth Nor need'st thou much importune me to that Whereon this month I have been hammering I have consider'd well his loss of time And how he can not be a perfect man Not being tried and tutor'd in the world Experience is by industry achiev'd And perfected by the swift course of time Then tell me whither were I best to send him I think your lordship is not ignorant How his companion youthful Valentine Attends the Emperor in his royal court I know it well ' Twere good I think your lordship sent him thither There shall he practise tilts and tournaments Hear sweet discourse converse with noblemen And be in eye of every exercise Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth I like thy counsel well hast thou advis'd And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it The execution of it shall make known Even with the speediest expedition I will dispatch him to the Emperor 's court To morrow may it please you Don Alphonso With other gentlemen of good esteem Are journeying to salute the Emperor And to commend their service to his will Good company with them shall Proteus go Sweet love sweet lines sweet life Here is her hand the agent of her heart Here is her oath for love her honour 's pawn O that our fathers would applaud our loves To seal our happiness with their consents O heavenly Julia How now What letter are you reading there May't please your lordship ' tis a word or two Of commendations sent from Valentine Deliver'd by a friend that came from him Lend me the letter let me see what news There is no news my lord but that he writes How happily he lives how well belov'd And daily graced by the Emperor Wishing me with him partner of his fortune And how stand you affected to his wish As one relying on your lordship 's will And not depending on his friendly wish My will is something sorted with his wish Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed For what I will I will and there an end I am resolv'd that thou shalt spend some time With Valentinus in the Emperor 's court What maintenance he from his friends receives Like exhibition thou shalt have from me To morrow be in readiness to go- Excuse it not for I am peremptory My lord I can not be so soon provided Please you deliberate a day or two Look what thou want'st shall be sent after thee No more of stay to morrow thou must go Come on Panthino you shall be employ'd To hasten on his expedition Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning And drench'd me in the sea where I am drown'd I fear'd to show my father Julia 's letter Lest he should take exceptions to my love And with the vantage of mine own excuse Hath he excepted most against my love O how this spring of love resembleth The uncertain glory of an April day Which now shows all the beauty of the sun And by an by a cloud takes all away Sir Proteus your father calls for you He is in haste therefore I pray you go Why this it is my heart accords thereto And yet a thousand times it answers ' No ' Exeunt Sir your glove Not mine my gloves are on Why then this may be yours for this is but one Ha let me see ay give it me it 's mine Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine Ah Silvia Silvia Calling Madam Silvia Madam Silvia How now sirrah She is not within hearing sir Why sir who bade you call her Your worship sir or else I mistook Well you 'll still be too forward And yet I was last chidden for being too slow Go to sir tell me do you know Madam Silvia She that your worship loves Why how know you that I am in love Marry by these special marks first you have learn'd like Sir Proteus to wreath your arms like a malcontent to relish a love song like a robin redbreast to walk alone like one that had the pestilence to sigh like a school boy that had lost his A B C to weep like a young wench that had buried her grandam to fast like one that takes diet to watch like one that fears robbing to speak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas You were wo nt when you laughed to crow like a cock when you walk'd to walk like one of the lions when you fasted it was presently after dinner when you look'd sadly it was for want of money And now you are metamorphis'd with a mistress that when I look on you I can hardly think you my master Are all these things perceiv'd in me They are all perceiv'd without ye Without me They can not Without you Nay that 's certain for without you were so simple none else would but you are so without these follies that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady But tell me dost thou know my lady Silvia She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper Hast thou observ'd that Even she I mean Why sir I know her not Dost thou know her by my gazing on her and yet know'st her not Is she not hard favour'd sir Not so fair boy as well favour'd Sir I know that well enough What dost thou know That she is not so fair as of you well favour'd I mean that her beauty is exquisite but her favour infinite That 's because the one is painted and the other out of all count How painted and how out of count Marry sir so painted to make her fair that no man counts of her beauty How esteem'st thou me I account of her beauty You never saw her since she was deform'd How long hath she been deform'd Ever since you lov'd her I have lov'd her ever since I saw her and still I see her beautiful If you love her you can not see her Why Because Love is blind O that you had mine eyes or your own eyes had the lights they were wo nt to have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungarter'd What should I see then Your own present folly and her passing deformity for he being in love could not see to garter his hose and you being in love can not see to put on your hose Belike boy then you are in love for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes True sir I was in love with my bed I thank you you swing'd me for my love which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours In conclusion I stand affected to her I would you were set so your affection would cease Last night she enjoin'd me to write some lines to one she loves And have you I have Are they not lamely writ No boy but as well as I can do them Aside O excellent motion O exceeding puppet Now will he interpret to her Madam and mistress a thousand good morrows Aside O give ye good ev'n Here 's a million of manners Sir Valentine and servant to you two thousand Aside He should give her interest and she gives it him As you enjoin'd me I have writ your letter Unto the secret nameless friend of yours Which I was much unwilling to proceed in But for my duty to your ladyship I thank you gentle servant ' Tis very clerkly done Now trust me madam it came hardly off For being ignorant to whom it goes I writ at random very doubtfully Perchance you think too much of so much pains No madam so it stead you I will write Please you command a thousand times as much And yet- A pretty period Well I guess the sequel And yet I will not name it- and yet I care not And yet take this again- and yet I thank you- Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more Aside And yet you will and yet another ' yet ' What means your ladyship Do you not like it Yes yes the lines are very quaintly writ But since unwillingly take them again Nay take them Gives hack the letter Madam they are for you Ay ay you writ them sir at my request But I will none of them they are for you I would have had them writ more movingly Please you I 'll write your ladyship another And when it 's writ for my sake read it over And if it please you so if not why so If it please me madam what then Why if it please you take it for your labour And so good morrow servant Exit SILVIA O jest unseen inscrutable invisible As a nose on a man 's face or a weathercock on a steeple My master sues to her and she hath taught her suitor He being her pupil to become her tutor O excellent device Was there ever heard a better That my master being scribe to himself should write the letter How now sir What are you reasoning with yourself Nay I was rhyming ' tis you that have the reason To do what To be a spokesman from Madam Silvia To whom To yourself why she woos you by a figure What figure By a letter I should say Why she hath not writ to me What need she when she hath made you write to yourself Why do you not perceive the jest No believe me No believing you indeed sir But did you perceive her earnest She gave me none except an angry word Why she hath given you a letter That 's the letter I writ to her friend And that letter hath she deliver'd and there an end I would it were no worse I 'll warrant you ' tis as well ' For often have you writ to her and she in modesty Or else for want of idle time could not again reply Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover ' All this I speak in print for in print I found it Why muse you sir ' Tis dinner time I have din'd Ay but hearken sir though the chameleon Love can feed on the air I am one that am nourish'd by my victuals and would fain have meat O be not like your mistress Be moved be moved Have patience gentle Julia I must where is no remedy When possibly I can I will return If you turn not you will return the sooner Keep this remembrance for thy Julia 's sake Why then we 'll make exchange Here take you this And seal the bargain with a holy kiss Here is my hand for my true constancy And when that hour o'erslips me in the day Wherein I sigh not Julia for thy sake The next ensuing hour some foul mischance Torment me for my love 's forgetfulness My father stays my coming answer not The tide is now- nay not thy tide of tears That tide will stay me longer than I should Julia farewell Exit JULIA What gone without a word Ay so true love should do it can not speak For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it Sir Proteus you are stay'd for Go I come I come Alas this parting strikes poor lovers dumb Exeunt Nay ' twill be this hour ere I have done weeping all the kind of the Launces have this very fault I have receiv'd my proportion like the Prodigious Son and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial 's court I think Crab my dog be the sourest natured dog that lives my mother weeping my father wailing my sister crying our maid howling our cat wringing her hands and all our house in a great perplexity yet did not this cruel hearted cur shed one tear He is a stone a very pebble stone and has no more pity in him than a dog A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting why my grandam having no eyes look you wept herself blind at my parting Nay I 'll show you the manner of it This shoe is my father no this left shoe is my father no no left shoe is my mother nay that can not be so neither yes it is so it is so it hath the worser sole This shoe with the hole in it is my mother and this my father A vengeance on ' t There ' tis Now sir this staff is my sister for look you she is as white as a lily and as small as a wand this hat is Nan our maid I am the dog no the dog is himself and I am the dog- O the dog is me and I am myself ay so so Now come I to my father ' Father your blessing ' Now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping now should I kiss my father well he weeps on Now come I to my mother O that she could speak now like a wood woman Well I kiss her- why there ' tis here 's my mother 's breath up and down Now come I to my sister mark the moan she makes Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a word but see how I lay the dust with my tears Launce away away aboard Thy master is shipp'd and thou art to post after with oars What 's the matter Why weep'st thou man Away ass You 'll lose the tide if you tarry any longer It is no matter if the tied were lost for it is the unkindest tied that ever any man tied What 's the unkindest tide Why he that 's tied here Crab my dog Tut man I mean thou'lt lose the flood and in losing the flood lose thy voyage and in losing thy voyage lose thy master and in losing thy master lose thy service and in losing thy service- Why dost thou stop my mouth For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue Where should I lose my tongue In thy tale In thy tail Lose the tide and the voyage and the master and the service and the tied Why man if the river were dry I am able to fill it with my tears if the wind were down I could drive the boat with my sighs Come come away man I was sent to call thee Sir call me what thou dar'st Will thou go Well I will go Exeunt Servant Mistress Master Sir Thurio frowns on you Ay boy it 's for love Not of you Of my mistress then ' Twere good you knock'd him Exit Servant you are sad Indeed madam I seem so Seem you that you are not Haply I do So do counterfeits So do you What seem I that I am not Wise What instance of the contrary Your folly And how quote you my folly I quote it in your jerkin My jerkin is a doublet Well then I 'll double your folly How What angry Sir Thurio Do you change colour Give him leave madam he is a kind of chameleon That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air You have said sir Ay sir and done too for this time I know it well sir you always end ere you begin A fine volley of words gentlemen and quickly shot off ' Tis indeed madam we thank the giver Who is that servant Yourself sweet lady for you gave the fire Sir Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship 's looks and spends what he borrows kindly in your company Sir if you spend word for word with me I shall make your wit bankrupt I know it well sir you have an exchequer of words and I think no other treasure to give your followers for it appears by their bare liveries that they live by your bare words No more gentlemen no more Here comes my father Now daughter Silvia you are hard beset Sir Valentine your father is in good health What say you to a letter from your friends Of much good news My lord I will be thankful To any happy messenger from thence Know ye Don Antonio your countryman Ay my good lord I know the gentleman To be of worth and worthy estimation And not without desert so well reputed Hath he not a son Ay my good lord a son that well deserves The honour and regard of such a father You know him well I knew him as myself for from our infancy We have convers'd and spent our hours together And though myself have been an idle truant Omitting the sweet benefit of time To clothe mine age with angel like perfection Yet hath Sir Proteus for that 's his name Made use and fair advantage of his days His years but young but his experience old His head unmellowed but his judgment ripe And in a word for far behind his worth Comes all the praises that I now bestow He is complete in feature and in mind With all good grace to grace a gentleman Beshrew me sir but if he make this good He is as worthy for an empress ' love As meet to be an emperor 's counsellor Well sir this gentleman is come to me With commendation from great potentates And here he means to spend his time awhile I think ' tis no unwelcome news to you Should I have wish'd a thing it had been he Welcome him then according to his worth- Silvia I speak to you and you Sir Thurio For Valentine I need not cite him to it I will send him hither to you presently Exit DUKE This is the gentleman I told your ladyship Had come along with me but that his mistresss Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks Belike that now she hath enfranchis'd them Upon some other pawn for fealty Nay sure I think she holds them prisoners still Nay then he should be blind and being blind How could he see his way to seek out you Why lady Love hath twenty pair of eyes They say that Love hath not an eye at all To see such lovers Thurio as yourself Upon a homely object Love can wink Exit THURIO Have done have done here comes the gentleman Welcome dear Proteus Mistress I beseech you Confirm his welcome with some special favour His worth is warrant for his welcome hither If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from Mistress it is sweet lady entertain him To be my fellow servant to your ladyship Too low a mistress for so high a servant Not so sweet lady but too mean a servant To have a look of such a worthy mistress Leave off discourse of disability Sweet lady entertain him for your servant My duty will I boast of nothing else And duty never yet did want his meed Servant you are welcome to a worthless mistress I 'll die on him that says so but yourself That you are welcome That you are worthless Madam my lord your father would speak with you I wait upon his pleasure Come Sir Thurio Go with me Once more new servant welcome I 'll leave you to confer of home affairs When you have done we look to hear from you We 'll both attend upon your ladyship Now tell me how do all from whence you came Your friends are well and have them much commended And how do yours I left them all in health How does your lady and how thrives your love My tales of love were wo nt to weary you I know you joy not in a love discourse Ay Proteus but that life is alter'd now I have done penance for contemning Love Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me With bitter fasts with penitential groans With nightly tears and daily heart sore sighs For in revenge of my contempt of love Love hath chas'd sleep from my enthralled eyes And made them watchers of mine own heart 's sorrow O gentle Proteus Love 's a mighty lord And hath so humbled me as I confess There is no woe to his correction Nor to his service no such joy on earth Now no discourse except it be of love Now can I break my fast dine sup and sleep Upon the very naked name of love Enough I read your fortune in your eye Was this the idol that you worship so Even she and is she not a heavenly saint No but she is an earthly paragon Call her divine I will not flatter her O flatter me for love delights in praises When I was sick you gave me bitter pills And I must minister the like to you Then speak the truth by her if not divine Yet let her be a principality Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth Except my mistress Sweet except not any Except thou wilt except against my love Have I not reason to prefer mine own And I will help thee to prefer her too She shall be dignified with this high honour- To bear my lady 's train lest the base earth Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss And of so great a favour growing proud Disdain to root the summer swelling flow'r And make rough winter everlastingly Why Valentine what braggardism is this Pardon me Proteus all I can is nothing To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing She is alone Then let her alone Not for the world Why man she is mine own And I as rich in having such a jewel As twenty seas if all their sand were pearl The water nectar and the rocks pure gold Forgive me that I do not dream on thee Because thou seest me dote upon my love My foolish rival that her father likes Only for his possessions are so huge Is gone with her along and I must after For love thou know'st is full of jealousy But she loves you Ay and we are betroth'd nay more our marriage hour With all the cunning manner of our flight Determin'd of- how I must climb her window The ladder made of cords and all the means Plotted and ' greed on for my happiness Good Proteus go with me to my chamber In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel Go on before I shall enquire you forth I must unto the road to disembark Some necessaries that I needs must use And then I 'll presently attend you Will you make haste I will Exit VALENTINE Even as one heat another heat expels Or as one nail by strength drives out another So the remembrance of my former love Is by a newer object quite forgotten Is it my mind or Valentinus ' praise Her true perfection or my false transgression That makes me reasonless to reason thus She is fair and so is Julia that I love- That I did love for now my love is thaw'd Which like a waxen image ' gainst a fire Bears no impression of the thing it was Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold And that I love him not as I was wo nt O but I love his lady too too much And that 's the reason I love him so little How shall I dote on her with more advice That thus without advice begin to love her ' Tis but her picture I have yet beheld And that hath dazzled my reason 's light But when I look on her perfections There is no reason but I shall be blind If I can check my erring love I will If not to compass her I 'll use my skill Exit Launce by mine honesty welcome to Padua Forswear not thyself sweet youth for I am not welcome I reckon this always that a man is never undone till he be hang'd nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say ' Welcome ' Come on you madcap I 'll to the alehouse with you presently where for one shot of five pence thou shalt have five thousand welcomes But sirrah how did thy master part with Madam Julia Marry after they clos'd in earnest they parted very fairly in jest But shall she marry him No How then Shall he marry her No neither What are they broken No they are both as whole as a fish Why then how stands the matter with them Marry thus when it stands well with him it stands well with her What an ass art thou I understand thee not What a block art thou that thou canst not My staff understands me What thou say'st Ay and what I do too look thee I 'll but lean and my staff understands me It stands under thee indeed Why stand under and under stand is all one But tell me true will't be a match Ask my dog If he say ay it will if he say no it will if he shake his tail and say nothing it will The conclusion is then that it will Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable ' Tis well that I get it so But Launce how say'st thou that my master is become a notable lover I never knew him otherwise Than how A notable lubber as thou reportest him to be Why thou whoreson ass thou mistak'st me Why fool I meant not thee I meant thy master I tell thee my master is become a hot lover Why I tell thee I care not though he burn himself in love If thou wilt go with me to the alehouse if not thou art an Hebrew a Jew and not worth the name of a Christian Why Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a Christian Wilt thou go At thy service Exeunt To leave my Julia shall I be forsworn To love fair Silvia shall I be forsworn To wrong my friend I shall be much forsworn And ev'n that pow'r which gave me first my oath Provokes me to this threefold perjury Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear O sweet suggesting Love if thou hast sinn'd Teach me thy tempted subject to excuse it At first I did adore a twinkling star But now I worship a celestial sun Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken And he wants wit that wants resolved will To learn his wit t ' exchange the bad for better Fie fie unreverend tongue to call her bad Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd With twenty thousand soul confirming oaths I can not leave to love and yet I do But there I leave to love where I should love Julia I lose and Valentine I lose If I keep them I needs must lose myself If I lose them thus find I by their loss For Valentine myself for Julia Silvia I to myself am dearer than a friend For love is still most precious in itself And Silvia- witness heaven that made her fair!- Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope I will forget that Julia is alive Rememb'ring that my love to her is dead And Valentine I 'll hold an enemy Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend I can not now prove constant to myself Without some treachery us'd to Valentine This night he meaneth with a corded ladder To climb celestial Silvia 's chamber window Myself in counsel his competitor Now presently I 'll give her father notice Of their disguising and pretended flight Who all enrag'd will banish Valentine For Thurio he intends shall we d his daughter But Valentine being gone I 'll quickly cross By some sly trick blunt Thurio 's dull proceeding Love lend me wings to make my purpose swift As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift Exit Counsel Lucetta gentle girl assist me And ev'n in kind love I do conjure thee Who art the table wherein all my thoughts Are visibly character'd and engrav'd To lesson me and tell me some good mean How with my honour I may undertake A journey to my loving Proteus Alas the way is wearisome and long A true devoted pilgrim is not weary To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps Much less shall she that hath Love 's wings to fly And when the flight is made to one so dear Of such divine perfection as Sir Proteus Better forbear till Proteus make return O know'st thou not his looks are my soul 's food Pity the dearth that I have pined in By longing for that food so long a time Didst thou but know the inly touch of love Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow As seek to quench the fire of love with words I do not seek to quench your love 's hot fire But qualify the fire 's extreme rage Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason The more thou dam'st it up the more it burns The current that with gentle murmur glides Thou know'st being stopp'd impatiently doth rage But when his fair course is not hindered He makes sweet music with th ' enamell'd stones Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge He overtaketh in his pilgrimage And so by many winding nooks he strays With willing sport to the wild ocean Then let me go and hinder not my course I 'll be as patient as a gentle stream And make a pastime of each weary step Till the last step have brought me to my love And there I 'll rest as after much turmoil A blessed soul doth in Elysium But in what habit will you go along Not like a woman for I would prevent The loose encounters of lascivious men Gentle Lucetta fit me with such weeds As may beseem some well reputed page Why then your ladyship must cut your hair No girl I 'll knit it up in silken strings With twenty odd conceited true love knots- To be fantastic may become a youth Of greater time than I shall show to be What fashion madam shall I make your breeches That fits as well as ' Tell me good my lord What compass will you wear your farthingale ' Why ev'n what fashion thou best likes Lucetta You must needs have them with a codpiece madam Out out Lucetta that will be ill favour'd A round hose madam now 's not worth a pin Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on Lucetta as thou lov'st me let me have What thou think'st meet and is most mannerly But tell me wench how will the world repute me For undertaking so unstaid a journey I fear me it will make me scandaliz'd If you think so then stay at home and go not Nay that I will not Then never dream on infamy but go If Proteus like your journey when you come No matter who 's displeas'd when you are gone I fear me he will scarce be pleas'd withal That is the least Lucetta of my fear A thousand oaths an ocean of his tears And instances of infinite of love Warrant me welcome to my Proteus All these are servants to deceitful men Base men that use them to so base effect But truer stars did govern Proteus ' birth His words are bonds his oaths are oracles His love sincere his thoughts immaculate His tears pure messengers sent from his heart His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth Pray heav'n he prove so when you come to him Now as thou lov'st me do him not that wrong To bear a hard opinion of his truth Only deserve my love by loving him And presently go with me to my chamber To take a note of what I stand in need of To furnish me upon my longing journey All that is mine I leave at thy dispose My goods my lands my reputation Only in lieu thereof dispatch me hence Come answer not but to it presently I am impatient of my tarriance Exeunt Sir Thurio give us leave I pray awhile We have some secrets to confer about Exit THURIO Now tell me Proteus what 's your will with me My gracious lord that which I would discover The law of friendship bids me to conceal But when I call to mind your gracious favours Done to me undeserving as I am My duty pricks me on to utter that Which else no worldly good should draw from me Know worthy prince Sir Valentine my friend This night intends to steal away your daughter Myself am one made privy to the plot I know you have determin'd to bestow her On Thurio whom your gentle daughter hates And should she thus be stol'n away from you It would be much vexation to your age Thus for my duty 's sake I rather chose To cross my friend in his intended drift Than by concealing it heap on your head A pack of sorrows which would press you down Being unprevented to your timeless grave Proteus I thank thee for thine honest care Which to requite command me while I live This love of theirs myself have often seen Haply when they have judg'd me fast asleep And oftentimes have purpos'd to forbid Sir Valentine her company and my court But fearing lest my jealous aim might err And so unworthily disgrace the man A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd I gave him gentle looks thereby to find That which thyself hast now disclos'd to me And that thou mayst perceive my fear of this Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested I nightly lodge her in an upper tow'r The key whereof myself have ever kept And thence she can not be convey'd away Know noble lord they have devis'd a mean How he her chamber window will ascend And with a corded ladder fetch her down For which the youthful lover now is gone And this way comes he with it presently Where if it please you you may intercept him But good my lord do it so cunningly That my discovery be not aimed at For love of you not hate unto my friend Hath made me publisher of this pretence Upon mine honour he shall never know That I had any light from thee of this Adieu my lord Sir Valentine is coming Exit Sir Valentine whither away so fast Please it your Grace there is a messenger That stays to bear my letters to my friends And I am going to deliver them Be they of much import The tenour of them doth but signify My health and happy being at your court Nay then no matter stay with me awhile I am to break with thee of some affairs That touch me near wherein thou must be secret ' Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter I know it well my lord and sure the match Were rich and honourable besides the gentleman Is full of virtue bounty worth and qualities Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter Can not your grace win her to fancy him No trust me she is peevish sullen froward Proud disobedient stubborn lacking duty Neither regarding that she is my child Nor fearing me as if I were her father And may I say to thee this pride of hers Upon advice hath drawn my love from her And where I thought the remnant of mine age Should have been cherish'd by her childlike duty I now am full resolv'd to take a wife And turn her out to who will take her in Then let her beauty be her wedding dow'r For me and my possessions she esteems not What would your Grace have me to do in this There is a lady in Verona here Whom I affect but she is nice and coy And nought esteems my aged eloquence Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor- For long agone I have forgot to court Besides the fashion of the time is chang'd- How and which way I may bestow myself To be regarded in her sun bright eye Win her with gifts if she respect not words Dumb jewels often in their silent kind More than quick words do move a woman 's mind But she did scorn a present that I sent her A woman sometime scorns what best contents her Send her another never give her o'er For scorn at first makes after love the more If she do frown ' tis not in hate of you But rather to beget more love in you If she do chide ' tis not to have you gone For why the fools are mad if left alone Take no repulse whatever she doth say For ' Get you gone ' she doth not mean ' Away ' Flatter and praise commend extol their graces Though ne'er so black say they have angels ' faces That man that hath a tongue I say is no man If with his tongue he can not win a woman But she I mean is promis'd by her friends Unto a youthful gentleman of worth And kept severely from resort of men That no man hath access by day to her Why then I would resort to her by night Ay but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe That no man hath recourse to her by night What lets but one may enter at her window Her chamber is aloft far from the ground And built so shelving that one can not climb it Without apparent hazard of his life Why then a ladder quaintly made of cords To cast up with a pair of anchoring hooks Would serve to scale another Hero 's tow'r So bold Leander would adventure it Now as thou art a gentleman of blood Advise me where I may have such a ladder When would you use it Pray sir tell me that This very night for Love is like a child That longs for everything that he can come by By seven o'clock I 'll get you such a ladder But hark thee I will go to her alone How shall I best convey the ladder thither It will be light my lord that you may bear it Under a cloak that is of any length A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn Ay my good lord Then let me see thy cloak I 'll get me one of such another length Why any cloak will serve the turn my lord How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak I pray thee let me feel thy cloak upon me What letter is this same What 's here ' To Silvia ' And here an engine fit for my proceeding I 'll be so bold to break the seal for once Reads And why not death rather than living torment To die is to be banish'd from myself And Silvia is myself banish'd from her Is self from self a deadly banishment What light is light if Silvia be not seen What joy is joy if Silvia be not by Unless it be to think that she is by And feed upon the shadow of perfection Except I be by Silvia in the night There is no music in the nightingale Unless I look on Silvia in the day There is no day for me to look upon She is my essence and I leave to be If I be not by her fair influence Foster'd illumin'd cherish'd kept alive I fly not death to fly his deadly doom Tarry I here I but attend on death But fly I hence I fly away from life Run boy run run seek him out So ho so ho What seest thou Him we go to find there 's not a hair on 's head but ' tis a Valentine Valentine No Who then his spirit Neither What then Nothing Can nothing speak Master shall I strike Who wouldst thou strike Nothing Villain forbear Why sir I 'll strike nothing I pray you- Sirrah I say forbear Friend Valentine a word My ears are stopp'd and can not hear good news So much of bad already hath possess'd them Then in dumb silence will I bury mine For they are harsh untuneable and bad Is Silvia dead No Valentine No Valentine indeed for sacred Silvia Hath she forsworn me No Valentine No Valentine if Silvia have forsworn me What is your news Sir there is a proclamation that you are vanished That thou art banished- O that 's the news!- From hence from Silvia and from me thy friend O I have fed upon this woe already And now excess of it will make me surfeit Doth Silvia know that I am banished Ay ay and she hath offered to the doom- Which unrevers'd stands in effectual force- A sea of melting pearl which some call tears Those at her father 's churlish feet she tender'd With them upon her knees her humble self Wringing her hands whose whiteness so became them As if but now they waxed pale for woe But neither bended knees pure hands held up Sad sighs deep groans nor silver shedding tears Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire- But Valentine if he be ta'en must die Besides her intercession chaf'd him so When she for thy repeal was suppliant That to close prison he commanded her With many bitter threats of biding there No more unless the next word that thou speak'st Have some malignant power upon my life If so I pray thee breathe it in mine ear As ending anthem of my endless dolour Cease to lament for that thou canst not help And study help for that which thou lament'st Time is the nurse and breeder of all good Here if thou stay thou canst not see thy love Besides thy staying will abridge thy life Hope is a lover 's staff walk hence with that And manage it against despairing thoughts Thy letters may be here though thou art hence Which being writ to me shall be deliver'd Even in the milk white bosom of thy love The time now serves not to expostulate Come I 'll convey thee through the city gate And ere I part with thee confer at large Of all that may concern thy love affairs As thou lov'st Silvia though not for thyself Regard thy danger and along with me I pray thee Launce an if thou seest my boy Bid him make haste and meet me at the Northgate Go sirrah find him out Come Valentine O my dear Silvia Hapless Valentine I am but a fool look you and yet I have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but that 's all one if he be but one knave He lives not now that knows me to be in love yet I am in love but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me nor who ' tis I love and yet ' tis a woman but what woman I will not tell myself and yet ' tis a milkmaid yet ' tis not a maid for she hath had gossips yet ' tis a maid for she is her master 's maid and serves for wages She hath more qualities than a water spaniel- which is much in a bare Christian Here is the cate log Pulling out a paper of her condition ' Inprimis She can fetch and carry ' Why a horse can do no more nay a horse can not fetch but only carry therefore is she better than a jade ' Item She can milk ' Look you a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands How now Signior Launce What news with your mastership With my master 's ship Why it is at sea Well your old vice still mistake the word What news then in your paper The black'st news that ever thou heard'st Why man how black Why as black as ink Let me read them Fie on thee jolt head thou canst not read Thou liest I can I will try thee Tell me this Who begot thee Marry the son of my grandfather O illiterate loiterer It was the son of thy grandmother This proves that thou canst not read Come fool come try me in thy paper Handing over the paper There and Saint Nicholas be thy speed Reads ' Inprimis She can milk ' Ay that she can ' Item She brews good ale ' And thereof comes the proverb Blessing of your heart you brew good ale ' Item She can sew ' That 's as much as to say ' Can she so ' ' Item She can knit ' What need a man care for a stock with a wench when she can knit him a stock ' Item She can wash and scour ' A special virtue for then she need not be wash'd and scour'd ' Item She can spin ' Then may I set the world on wheels when she can spin for her living ' Item She hath many nameless virtues ' That 's as much as to say ' bastard virtues ' that indeed know not their fathers and therefore have no names ' Here follow her vices ' Close at the heels of her virtues ' Item She is not to be kiss'd fasting in respect of her breath ' Well that fault may be mended with a breakfast Read on ' Item She hath a sweet mouth ' That makes amends for her sour breath ' Item She doth talk in her sleep ' It 's no matter for that so she sleep not in her talk ' Item She is slow in words ' O villain that set this down among her vices To be slow in words is a woman 's only virtue I pray thee out with't and place it for her chief virtue ' Item She is proud ' Out with that too it was Eve 's legacy and can not be ta'en from her ' Item She hath no teeth ' I care not for that neither because I love crusts ' Item She is curst ' Well the best is she hath no teeth to bite ' Item She will often praise her liquor ' If her liquor be good she shall if she will not I will for good things should be praised ' Item She is too liberal ' Of her tongue she can not for that 's writ down she is slow of of her purse she shall not for that I 'll keep shut Now of another thing she may and that can not I help Well proceed ' Item She hath more hair than wit and more faults than hairs and more wealth than faults ' Stop there I 'll have her she was mine and not mine twice or thrice in that last article Rehearse that once more ' Item She hath more hair than wit'- More hair than wit It may be I 'll prove it the cover of the salt hides the salt and therefore it is more than the salt the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit for the greater hides the less What 's next ' And more faults than hairs'- That 's monstrous O that that were out ' And more wealth than faults ' Why that word makes the faults gracious Well I 'll have her an if it be a match as nothing is impossible- What then Why then will I tell thee- that thy master stays for thee at the Northgate For me For thee ay who art thou He hath stay'd for a better man than thee And must I go to him Thou must run to him for thou hast stay'd so long that going will scarce serve the turn Why didst not tell me sooner Pox of your love letters Now will he be swing'd for reading my letter An unmannerly slave that will thrust himself into secrets I 'll after to rejoice in the boy 's correction Exit Sir Thurio fear not but that she will love you Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight Since his exile she hath despis'd me most Forsworn my company and rail'd at me That I am desperate of obtaining her This weak impress of love is as a figure Trenched in ice which with an hour 's heat Dissolves to water and doth lose his form A little time will melt her frozen thoughts And worthless Valentine shall be forgot Gone my good lord My daughter takes his going grievously A little time my lord will kill that grief So I believe but Thurio thinks not so Proteus the good conceit I hold of thee- For thou hast shown some sign of good desert- Makes me the better to confer with thee Longer than I prove loyal to your Grace Let me not live to look upon your Grace Thou know'st how willingly I would effect The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter I do my lord And also I think thou art not ignorant How she opposes her against my will She did my lord when Valentine was here Ay and perversely she persevers so What might we do to make the girl forget The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio The best way is to slander Valentine With falsehood cowardice and poor descent- Three things that women highly hold in hate Ay but she 'll think that it is spoke in hate Ay if his enemy deliver it Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken By one whom she esteemeth as his friend Then you must undertake to slander him And that my lord I shall be loath to do ' Tis an ill office for a gentleman Especially against his very friend Where your good word can not advantage him Your slander never can endamage him Therefore the office is indifferent Being entreated to it by your friend You have prevail'd my lord if I can do it By aught that I can speak in his dispraise She shall not long continue love to him But say this weed her love from Valentine It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio Therefore as you unwind her love from him Lest it should ravel and be good to none You must provide to bottom it on me Which must be done by praising me as much As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine And Proteus we dare trust you in this kind Because we know on Valentine 's report You are already Love 's firm votary And can not soon revolt and change your mind Upon this warrant shall you have access Where you with Silvia may confer at large- For she is lumpish heavy melancholy And for your friend 's sake will be glad of you- Where you may temper her by your persuasion To hate young Valentine and love my friend As much as I can do I will effect But you Sir Thurio are not sharp enough You must lay lime to tangle her desires By wailful sonnets whose composed rhymes Should be full fraught with serviceable vows Ay Much is the force of heaven bred poesy Say that upon the altar of her beauty You sacrifice your tears your sighs your heart Write till your ink be dry and with your tears Moist it again and frame some feeling line That may discover such integrity For Orpheus ' lute was strung with poets ' sinews Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones Make tigers tame and huge leviathans Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands After your dire lamenting elegies Visit by night your lady 's chamber window With some sweet consort to their instruments Tune a deploring dump- the night 's dead silence Will well become such sweet complaining grievance This or else nothing will inherit her This discipline shows thou hast been in love And thy advice this night I 'll put in practice Therefore sweet Proteus my direction giver Let us into the city presently To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music I have a sonnet that will serve the turn To give the onset to thy good advice About it gentlemen We 'll wait upon your Grace till after supper And afterward determine our proceedings Even now about it I will pardon you Exeunt Fellows stand fast I see a passenger If there be ten shrink not but down with 'em Stand sir and throw us that you have about ye If not we 'll make you sit and rifle you Sir we are undone these are the villains That all the travellers do fear so much My friends- That 's not so sir we are your enemies Peace we 'll hear him Ay by my beard will we for he is a proper man Then know that I have little wealth to lose A man I am cross'd with adversity My riches are these poor habiliments Of which if you should here disfurnish me You take the sum and substance that I have Whither travel you To Verona Whence came you From Milan Have you long sojourn'd there Some sixteen months and longer might have stay'd If crooked fortune had not thwarted me What were you banish'd thence I was For what offence For that which now torments me to rehearse I kill'd a man whose death I much repent But yet I slew him manfully in fight Without false vantage or base treachery Why ne'er repent it if it were done so But were you banish'd for so small a fault I was and held me glad of such a doom Have you the tongues My youthful travel therein made me happy Or else I often had been miserable By the bare scalp of Robin Hood 's fat friar This fellow were a king for our wild faction We 'll have him Sirs a word Master be one of them it 's an honourable kind of thievery Peace villain Tell us this have you anything to take to Nothing but my fortune Know then that some of us are gentlemen Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth Thrust from the company of awful men Myself was from Verona banished For practising to steal away a lady An heir and near allied unto the Duke And I from Mantua for a gentleman Who in my mood I stabb'd unto the heart And I for such like petty crimes as these But to the purpose- for we cite our faults That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives And partly seeing you are beautified With goodly shape and by your own report A linguist and a man of such perfection As we do in our quality much want- Indeed because you are a banish'd man Therefore above the rest we parley to you Are you content to be our general- To make a virtue of necessity And live as we do in this wilderness What say'st thou Wilt thou be of our consort Say ' ay ' and be the captain of us all We 'll do thee homage and be rul'd by thee Love thee as our commander and our king But if thou scorn our courtesy thou diest Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd I take your offer and will live with you Provided that you do no outrages On silly women or poor passengers No we detest such vile base practices Come go with us we 'll bring thee to our crews And show thee all the treasure we have got Which with ourselves all rest at thy dispose Exeunt Already have I been false to Valentine And now I must be as unjust to Thurio Under the colour of commending him I have access my own love to prefer But Silvia is too fair too true too holy To be corrupted with my worthless gifts When I protest true loyalty to her She twits me with my falsehood to my friend When to her beauty I commend my vows She bids me think how I have been forsworn In breaking faith with Julia whom I lov'd And notwithstanding all her sudden quips The least whereof would quell a lover 's hope Yet spaniel like the more she spurns my love The more it grows and fawneth on her still How now Sir Proteus are you crept before us Ay gentle Thurio for you know that love Will creep in service where it can not go Ay but I hope sir that you love not here Sir but I do or else I would be hence Who Silvia Ay Silvia- for your sake I thank you for your own Now

How now are you sadder than you were before How do you man The music likes you not You mistake the musician likes me not Why my pretty youth He plays false father How out of tune on the strings Not so

Often resort unto this gentlewoman I tell you what Launce his man told me he lov'd her out of all nick Where is Launce Gone to seek his dog which to morrow by his master 's command he must carry for a present to his lady Peace stand aside the company parts Sir Thurio fear not you I will so plead That you shall say my cunning drift excels Where meet we At Saint Gregory 's well Farewell Exeunt THURIO and MUSICIANS Madam good ev'n to your ladyship I thank you for your music gentlemen Who is that that spake One lady if you knew his pure heart 's truth You would quickly learn to know him by his voice Sir Proteus as I take it Sir Proteus gentle lady and your servant What 's your will That I may compass yours You have your wish my will is even this That presently you hie you home to bed Thou subtle perjur'd false disloyal man Think'st thou I am so shallow so conceitless To be seduced by thy flattery That hast deceiv'd so many with thy vows Return return and make thy love amends For me by this pale queen of night I swear I am so far from granting thy request That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit And by and by intend to chide myself Even for this time I spend in talking to thee I grant sweet love that I did love a lady But she is dead Aside ' Twere false if I should speak it For I am sure she is not buried Say that she be yet Valentine thy friend Survives to whom thyself art witness I am betroth'd and art thou not asham'd To wrong him with thy importunacy I likewise hear that Valentine is dead And so suppose am I for in his grave Assure thyself my love is buried Sweet lady let me rake it from the earth Go to thy lady 's grave and call hers thence Or at the least in hers sepulchre thine Aside He heard not that Madam if your heart be so obdurate Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love The picture that is hanging in your chamber To that I 'll speak to that I 'll sigh and weep For since the substance of your perfect self Is else devoted I am but a shadow And to your shadow will I make true love Aside If ' twere a substance you would sure deceive it And make it but a shadow as I am I am very loath to be your idol sir But since your falsehood shall become you well To worship shadows and adore false shapes Send to me in the morning and I 'll send it And so good rest As wretches have o'ernight That wait for execution in the morn Host will you go By my halidom I was fast asleep Pray you where lies Sir Proteus Marry at my house Trust me I think ' tis almost day Not so but it hath been the longest night That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest Exeunt This is the hour that Madam Silvia Entreated me to call and know her mind There 's some great matter she 'd employ me in Madam madam Who calls Your servant and your friend One that attends your ladyship 's command Sir Eglamour a thousand times good morrow As many worthy lady to yourself According to your ladyship 's impose I am thus early come to know what service It is your pleasure to command me in O Eglamour thou art a gentleman- Think not I flatter for I swear I do not- Valiant wise remorseful well accomplish'd Thou art not ignorant what dear good will I bear unto the banish'd Valentine Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio whom my very soul abhors Thyself hast lov'd and I have heard thee say No grief did ever come so near thy heart As when thy lady and thy true love died Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity Sir Eglamour I would to Valentine To Mantua where I hear he makes abode And for the ways are dangerous to pass I do desire thy worthy company Upon whose faith and honour I repose Urge not my father 's anger Eglamour But think upon my grief a lady 's grief And on the justice of my flying hence To keep me from a most unholy match Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues I do desire thee even from a heart As full of sorrows as the sea of sands To bear me company and go with me If not to hide what I have said to thee That I may venture to depart alone Madam I pity much your grievances Which since I know they virtuously are plac'd I give consent to go along with you Recking as little what betideth me As much I wish all good befortune you When will you go This evening coming Where shall I meet you At Friar Patrick 's cell Where I intend holy confession I will not fail your ladyship Good morrow gentle lady Good morrow kind Sir Eglamour Exeunt When a man 's servant shall play the cur with him look you it goes hard- one that I brought up of a puppy one that I sav'd from drowning when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it I have taught him even as one would say precisely ' Thus I would teach a dog ' I was sent to deliver him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master and I came no sooner into the dining chamber but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon 's leg O ' tis a foul thing when a cur can not keep himself in all companies I would have as one should say one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed to be as it were a dog at all things If I had not had more wit than he to take a fault upon me that he did I think verily he had been hang'd for't sure as I live he had suffer'd for't You shall judge He thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentleman like dogs under the Duke 's table he had not been there bless the mark a pissing while but all the chamber smelt him ' Out with the dog ' says one ' What cur is that ' says another ' Whip him out ' says the third ' Hang him up ' says the Duke I having been acquainted with the smell before knew it was Crab and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs ' Friend ' quoth I ' you mean to whip the dog ' ' Ay marry do I ' quoth he ' You do him the more wrong ' quoth I twas I did the thing you wot of ' He makes me no more ado but whips me out of the chamber How many masters would do this for his servant Nay I 'll be sworn I have sat in the stock for puddings he hath stol'n otherwise he had been executed I have stood on the pillory for geese he hath kill'd otherwise he had suffer'd for't Thou think'st not of this now Nay I remember the trick you serv'd me when I took my leave of Madam Silvia Did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I do When didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman 's farthingale Didst thou ever see me do such a trick Sebastian is thy name I like thee well And will employ thee in some service presently In what you please I 'll do what I can .I hope thou wilt To LAUNCE How now you whoreson Marry sir I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me And what says she to my little jewel Marry she says your dog was a cur and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present But she receiv'd my dog No indeed did she not here have I brought him back again What didst thou offer her this from me Ay sir the other squirrel was stol'n from me by the hangman 's boys in the market place and then I offer'd her mine own who is a dog as big as ten of yours and therefore the gift the greater Go get thee hence and find my dog again Or ne'er return again into my sight Away I say Stayest thou to vex me here Exit LAUNCE A slave that still an end turns me to shame Sebastian I have entertained thee Partly that I have need of such a youth That can with some discretion do my business For ' tis no trusting to yond foolish lout But chiefly for thy face and thy behaviour Which if my augury deceive me not Witness good bringing up fortune and truth Therefore know thou for this I entertain thee Go presently and take this ring with thee Deliver it to Madam Silvia- She lov'd me well deliver'd it to me It seems you lov'd not her to leave her token She is dead belike Not so I think she lives Alas Why dost thou cry ' Alas ' I can not choose But pity her Wherefore shouldst thou pity her Because methinks that she lov'd you as well As you do love your lady Silvia She dreams on him that has forgot her love You dote on her that cares not for your love ' Tis pity love should be so contrary And thinking on it makes me cry ' Alas ' Well give her that ring and therewithal This letter That 's her chamber Tell my lady I claim the promise for her heavenly picture Your message done hie home unto my chamber Where thou shalt find me sad and solitary Exit PROTEUS How many women would do such a message Alas poor Proteus thou hast entertain'd A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs Alas poor fool why do I pity him That with his very heart despiseth me Because he loves her he despiseth me Because I love him I must pity him This ring I gave him when he parted from me To bind him to remember my good will And now am I unhappy messenger To plead for that which I would not obtain To carry that which I would have refus'd To praise his faith which I would have disprais'd I am my master 's true confirmed love But can not be true servant to my master Unless I prove false traitor to myself Yet will I woo for him but yet so coldly As heaven it knows I would not have him speed What would you with her if that I be she If you be she I do entreat your patience To hear me speak the message I am sent on From whom From my master Sir Proteus madam O he sends you for a picture Ay madam Ursula bring my picture there Go give your master this Tell him from me One Julia that his changing thoughts forget Would better fit his chamber than this shadow Madam please you peruse this letter Pardon me madam I have unadvis'd Deliver'd you a paper that I should not This is the letter to your ladyship I pray thee let me look on that again It may not be good madam pardon me There hold I will not look upon your master 's lines I know they are stuff'd with protestations And full of new found oaths which he wul break As easily as I do tear his paper Madam he sends your ladyship this ring The more shame for him that he sends it me For I have heard him say a thousand times His Julia gave it him at his departure Though his false finger have profan'd the ring Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong She thanks you What say'st thou I thank you madam that you tender her Poor gentlewoman my master wrongs her much Dost thou know her Almost as well as I do know myself To think upon her woes I do protest That I have wept a hundred several times Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her I think she doth and that 's her cause of sorrow Is she not passing fair She hath been fairer madam than she is When she did think my master lov'd her well She in my judgment was as fair as you But since she did neglect her looking glass And threw her sun expelling mask away The air hath starv'd the roses in her cheeks And pinch'd the lily tincture of her face That now she is become as black as I. How tall was she About my stature for at Pentecost When all our pageants of delight were play'd Our youth got me to play the woman 's part And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia 's gown Which served me as fit by all men 's judgments As if the garment had been made for me Therefore I know she is about my height And at that time I made her weep a good For I did play a lamentable part Madam ' twas Ariadne passioning For Theseus ' perjury and unjust flight Which I so lively acted with my tears That my poor mistress moved therewithal Wept bitterly and would I might be dead If I in thought felt not her very sorrow She is beholding to thee gentle youth Alas poor lady desolate and left I weep myself to think upon thy words Here youth there is my purse I give thee this For thy sweet mistress ' sake because thou lov'st her Farewell Exit SILVIA with ATTENDANTS And she shall thank you for't if e'er you know her A virtuous gentlewoman mild and beautiful I hope my master 's suit will be but cold Since she respects my mistress ' love so much Alas how love can trifle with itself Here is her picture let me see I think If I had such a tire this face of mine Were full as lovely as is this of hers And yet the painter flatter'd her a little Unless I flatter with myself too much Her hair is auburn mine is perfect yellow If that be all the difference in his love I 'll get me such a colour'd periwig Her eyes are grey as glass and so are mine Ay but her forehead 's low and mine 's as high What should it be that he respects in her But I can make respective in myself If this fond Love were not a blinded god Come shadow come and take this shadow up For ' tis thy rival O thou senseless form Thou shalt be worshipp'd kiss'd lov'd and ador'd And were there sense in his idolatry My substance should be statue in thy stead I 'll use thee kindly for thy mistress ' sake That us'd me so or else by Jove I vow I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes To make my master out of love with thee Exit The sun begins to gild the western sky And now it is about the very hour That Silvia at Friar Patrick 's cell should meet me She will not fail for lovers break not hours Unless it be to come before their time So much they spur their expedition Amen amen Go on good Eglamour Out at the postern by the abbey wall I fear I am attended by some spies Fear not The forest is not three leagues off If we recover that we are sure enough Exeunt Sir Proteus what says Silvia to my suit O sir I find her milder than she was And yet she takes exceptions at your person What that my leg is too long No that it is too little I 'll wear a boot to make it somewhat rounder Aside But love will not be spurr'd to what it loathes What says she to my face She says it is a fair one Nay then the wanton lies my face is black But pearls are fair and the old saying is Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies ' eyes Aside ' Tis true such pearls as put out ladies ' eyes For I had rather wink than look on them How likes she my discourse Ill when you talk of war But well when I discourse of love and peace Aside But better indeed when you hold your peace What says she to my valour O sir she makes no doubt of that Aside She needs not when she knows it cowardice What says she to my birth That you are well deriv'd Aside True from a gentleman to a fool Considers she my possessions O ay and pities them Wherefore Aside That such an ass should owe them That they are out by lease Here comes the Duke How now Sir Proteus how now Thurio Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late Not I. Nor I. Saw you my daughter Neither Why then She 's fled unto that peasant Valentine And Eglamour is in her company ' Tis true for Friar Lawrence met them both As he in penance wander'd through the forest Him he knew well and guess'd that it was she But being mask'd he was not sure of it Besides she did intend confession At Patrick 's cell this even and there she was not These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence Therefore I pray you stand not to discourse But mount you presently and meet with me Upon the rising of the mountain foot That leads toward Mantua whither they are fled Dispatch sweet gentlemen and follow me Exit Why this it is to be a peevish girl That flies her fortune when it follows her I 'll after more to be reveng'd on Eglamour Than for the love of reckless Silvia Exit And I will follow more for Silvia 's love Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her Exit And I will follow more to cross that love Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love Exit Come come Be patient we must bring you to our captain A thousand more mischances than this one Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently Come bring her away Where is the gentleman that was with her Being nimble footed he hath outrun us But Moyses and Valerius follow him Go thou with her to the west end of the wood There is our captain we 'll follow him that 's fled The thicket is beset he can not ' scape Come I must bring you to our captain 's cave Fear not he bears an honourable mind And will not use a woman lawlessly O Valentine this I endure for thee Exeunt How use doth breed a habit in a man This shadowy desert unfrequented woods I better brook than flourishing peopled towns Here can I sit alone unseen of any And to the nightingale 's complaining notes Tune my distresses and record my woes O thou that dost inhabit in my breast Leave not the mansion so long tenantless Lest growing ruinous the building fall And leave no memory of what it was Repair me with thy presence Silvia Thou gentle nymph cherish thy forlorn swain What halloing and what stir is this to day These are my mates that make their wills their law Have some unhappy passenger in chase They love me well yet I have much to do To keep them from uncivil outrages Withdraw thee Valentine Who 's this comes here Madam this service I have done for you Though you respect not aught your servant doth To hazard life and rescue you from him That would have forc'd your honour and your love Vouchsafe me for my meed but one fair look A smaller boon than this I can not beg And less than this I am sure you can not give Aside How like a dream is this I see and hear Love lend me patience to forbear awhile O miserable unhappy that I am Unhappy were you madam ere I came But by my coming I have made you happy By thy approach thou mak'st me most unhappy Aside And me when he approacheth to your presence Had I been seized by a hungry lion I would have been a breakfast to the beast Rather than have false Proteus rescue me O heaven be judge how I love Valentine Whose life 's as tender to me as my soul And full as much for more there can not be I do detest false perjur'd Proteus Therefore be gone solicit me no more What dangerous action stood it next to death Would I not undergo for one calm look O ' tis the curse in love and still approv'd When women can not love where they 're belov'd When Proteus can not love where he 's belov'd Read over Julia 's heart thy first best love For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith Into a thousand oaths and all those oaths Descended into perjury to love me Thou hast no faith left now unless thou'dst two And that 's far worse than none better have none Than plural faith which is too much by one Thou counterfeit to thy true friend In love Who respects friend All men but Proteus Nay if the gentle spirit of moving words Can no way change you to a milder form I 'll woo you like a soldier at arms ' end And love you ' gainst the nature of love- force ye O heaven I 'll force thee yield to my desire Ruffian let go that rude uncivil touch Thou friend of an ill fashion Valentine Thou common friend that 's without faith or love- For such is a friend now treacherous man Thou hast beguil'd my hopes nought but mine eye Could have persuaded me Now I dare not say I have one friend alive thou wouldst disprove me Who should be trusted when one 's own right hand Is perjured to the bosom Proteus I am sorry I must never trust thee more But count the world a stranger for thy sake The private wound is deepest O time most accurst ' Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst My shame and guilt confounds me Forgive me Valentine if hearty sorrow Be a sufficient ransom for offence I tender ' t here I do as truly suffer As e'er I did commit Then I am paid And once again I do receive thee honest Who by repentance is not satisfied Is nor of heaven nor earth for these are pleas'd By penitence th ' Eternal 's wrath 's appeas'd And that my love may appear plain and free All that was mine in Silvia I give thee O me unhappy Swoons Look to the boy Why boy why wag how now What 's the matter Look up speak O good sir my master charg'd me to deliver a ring to Madam Silvia which out of my neglect was never done Where is that ring boy Here ' tis this is it How let me see Why this is the ring I gave to Julia O cry you mercy sir I have mistook This is the ring you sent to Silvia But how cam'st thou by this ring At my depart I gave this unto Julia And Julia herself did give it me And Julia herself have brought it hither How Julia Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root O Proteus let this habit make thee blush Be thou asham'd that I have took upon me Such an immodest raiment- if shame live In a disguise of love It is the lesser blot modesty finds Women to change their shapes than men their minds Than men their minds ' tis true O heaven were man But constant he were perfect That one error Fills him with faults makes him run through all th ' sins Inconstancy falls off ere it begins What is in Silvia 's face but I may spy More fresh in Julia 's with a constant eye Come come a hand from either Let me be blest to make this happy close ' Twere pity two such friends should be long foes Bear witness heaven I have my wish for ever And I mine A prize a prize a prize Forbear forbear I say it is my lord the Duke Your Grace is welcome to a man disgrac'd Banished Valentine Sir Valentine Yonder is Silvia and Silvia 's mine Thurio give back or else embrace thy death Come not within the measure of my wrath Do not name Silvia thine if once again Verona shall not hold thee Here she stands Take but possession of her with a touch- I dare thee but to breathe upon my love Sir Valentine I care not for her I I hold him but a fool that will endanger His body for a girl that loves him not I claim her not and therefore she is thine The more degenerate and base art thou To make such means for her as thou hast done And leave her on such slight conditions Now by the honour of my ancestry I do applaud thy spirit Valentine And think thee worthy of an empress ' love Know then I here forget all former griefs Cancel all grudge repeal thee home again Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit To which I thus subscribe Sir Valentine Thou art a gentleman and well deriv'd Take thou thy Silvia for thou hast deserv'd her I thank your Grace the gift hath made me happy I now beseech you for your daughter 's sake To grant one boon that I shall ask of you I grant it for thine own whate'er it be These banish'd men that I have kept withal Are men endu'd with worthy qualities Forgive them what they have committed here And let them be recall'd from their exile They are reformed civil full of good And fit for great employment worthy lord Thou hast prevail'd I pardon them and thee Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts Come let us go we will include all jars With triumphs mirth and rare solemnity And as we walk along I dare be bold With our discourse to make your Grace to smile What think you of this page my lord I think the boy hath grace in him he blushes I warrant you my lord- more grace than boy What mean you by that saying Please you I 'll tell you as we pass along That you will wonder what hath fortuned Come Proteus ' tis your penance but to hear The story of your loves discovered That done our day of marriage shall be yours One feast one house one mutual happiness Exeunt If you shall chance Camillo to visit Bohemia on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot you shall see as I have said great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves for indeed- Beseech you- Verily I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we can not with such magnificence in so rare- I know not what to say We will give you sleepy drinks that your senses unintelligent of our insufficience may though they can not praise us as little accuse us You pay a great deal too dear for what 's given freely Believe me I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance Sicilia can not show himself overkind to Bohemia They were train'd together in their childhoods and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which can not choose but branch now Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society their encounters though not personal have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts letters loving embassies that they have seem'd to be together though absent shook hands as over a vast and embrac'd as it were from the ends of opposed winds The heavens continue their loves I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note I very well agree with you in the hopes of him It is a gallant child one that indeed physics the subject makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man Would they else be content to die Yes if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live If the King had no son they would desire to live on crutches till he had one Nine changes of the wat'ry star hath been The shepherd 's note since we have left our throne Without a burden Time as long again Would be fill'd up my brother with our thanks And yet we should for perpetuity Go hence in debt And therefore like a cipher Yet standing in rich place I multiply With one ' We thank you ' many thousands moe That go before it Stay your thanks a while And pay them when you part Sir that 's to morrow I am question'd by my fears of what may chance Or breed upon our absence that may blow No sneaping winds at home to make us say ' This is put forth too truly ' Besides I have stay'd To tire your royalty We are tougher brother Than you can put us to't No longer stay One sev'night longer Very sooth to morrow We 'll part the time between 's then and in that I 'll no gainsaying Press me not beseech you so There is no tongue that moves none none i ' th ' world So soon as yours could win me So it should now Were there necessity in your request although ' Twere needful I denied it My affairs Do even drag me homeward which to hinder Were in your love a whip to me my stay To you a charge and trouble To save both Farewell our brother Tongue tied our Queen Speak you I had thought sir to have held my peace until You had drawn oaths from him not to stay You sir Charge him too coldly Tell him you are sure All in Bohemia 's well- this satisfaction The by gone day proclaim'd Say this to him He 's beat from his best ward Well said Hermione To tell he longs to see his son were strong But let him say so then and let him go But let him swear so and he shall not stay We 'll thwack him hence with distaffs To POLIXENES Yet of your royal presence I 'll adventure

Should yet say ' Sir no going ' Verily You shall not go a lady 's ' verily ' is As potent as a lord 's Will go yet Force me to keep you as a prisoner Not like a guest so you shall pay your fees When you depart and save your thanks How say you My prisoner or my guest By your dread ' verily ' One of them you shall be Your guest then madam To be your prisoner should import offending Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish Not your gaoler then But your kind hostess Come I 'll question you Of my lord 's tricks and yours when you were boys You were pretty lordings then We were fair Queen Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day to morrow as to day And to be boy eternal Was not my lord The verier wag o ' th ' two We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i ' th

been higher rear'd With stronger blood we should have answer'd heaven Boldly ' Not guilty ' the imposition clear'd Hereditary ours By this we gather You have tripp'd since O my most sacred lady Temptations have since then been born to 's for In those unfledg'd days was my wife a girl Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes Of my young playfellow Grace to boot Of this make no

stays here longer Ha Stays here longer Ay but why To satisfy your Highness and the entreaties Of our most gracious mistress Satisfy Th ' entreaties of your mistress Satisfy Let that suffice I have trusted thee Camillo With all the nearest things to my heart as well My chamber councils wherein priest like thou Hast cleans'd my bosom- I from thee departed Thy penitent reform'd but we have been Deceiv'd in thy integrity deceiv'd In that which seems so Be it forbid my lord To bide upon't thou art not honest or If thou inclin'st that way thou art a coward Which hoxes honesty behind restraining From course requir'd or else thou must be counted A servant grafted in my serious trust And therein negligent or else a fool That seest a game play'd home the rich stake drawn And tak'st it all for jest My gracious lord I may be negligent foolish and fearful In every one of these no man is free But that his negligence his folly fear Among the infinite doings of the world Sometime puts forth In your affairs my lord If ever I were wilfull negligent It was my folly if industriously I play'd the fool it was my negligence Not weighing well the end if ever fearful To do a thing where I the issue doubted Whereof the execution did cry out Against the non performance ' twas a fear Which oft infects the wisest These my lord Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty Is never free of But beseech your Grace Be plainer with me let me know my trespass By its own visage if I then deny it ' Tis none of mine Ha ' not you seen Camillo- But that 's past doubt you have or your eye glass Is thicker than a cuckold 's horn- or heard- For to a vision so apparent rumour Can not be mute- or thought- for cogitation Resides not in that man that does not think- My wife is slippery If thou wilt confess- Or else be impudently negative To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought- then say My wife 's a hobby horse deserves a name As rank as any flax wench that puts to Before her troth plight Say't and justify't I would not be a stander by to hear My sovereign mistress clouded so without My present vengeance taken Shrew my heart You never spoke what did become you less Than this which to reiterate were sin As deep as that though true Is whispering nothing Is leaning cheek to cheek Is meeting noses Kissing with inside lip Stopping the career Of laughter with a sigh?- a note infallible Of breaking honesty Horsing foot on foot Skulking in corners Wishing clocks more swift Hours minutes noon midnight And all eyes Blind with the pin and web but theirs theirs only That would unseen be wicked- is this nothing Why then the world and all that 's in't is nothing The covering sky is nothing Bohemia nothing My is nothing nor nothing have these nothings If this be nothing Good my lord be cur'd Of this diseas'd opinion and betimes For ' tis most dangerous Say it be ' tis true No no my lord It is you lie you lie I say thou liest Camillo and I hate thee Pronounce thee a gross lout a mindless slave Or else a hovering temporizer that Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil Inclining to them both Were my wife 's liver Infected as her life she would not live The running of one glass Who does her Why he that wears her like her medal hanging About his neck Bohemia who- if I Had servants true about me that bare eyes To see alike mine honour as their profits Their own particular thrifts they would do that Which should undo more doing Ay and thou His cupbearer- whom I from meaner form Have bench'd and rear'd to worship who mayst see Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven How I am gall'd- mightst bespice a cup To give mine enemy a lasting wink Which draught to me were cordial Sir my lord I could do this and that with no rash potion But with a ling'ring dram that should not work Maliciously like poison But I can not Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress So sovereignly being honourable I have lov'd thee- Make that thy question and go rot Dost think I am so muddy so unsettled To appoint myself in this vexation sully The purity and whiteness of my sheets- Which to preserve is sleep which being spotted Is goads thorns nettles tails of wasps Give scandal to the blood o ' th ' Prince my son- Who I do think is mine and love as mine- Without ripe moving to ' t Would I do this Could man so blench I must believe you sir I do and will fetch off Bohemia for't Provided that when he 's remov'd your Highness Will take again your queen as yours at first Even for your son 's sake and thereby for sealing The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms Known and allied to yours Thou dost advise me Even so as I mine own course have set down I 'll give no blemish to her honour none My lord Go then and with a countenance as clear As friendship wears at feasts keep with Bohemia And with your queen I am his cupbearer If from me he have wholesome beverage Account me not your servant This is all Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart Do't not thou split'st thine own I 'll do't my lord I will seem friendly as thou hast advis'd me Exit O miserable lady But for me What case stand I in I must be the poisoner Of good Polixenes and my ground to do't Is the obedience to a master one Who in rebellion with himself will have All that are his so too To do this deed Promotion follows If I could find example Of thousands that had struck anointed kings And flourish'd after I 'd not do't but since Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one Let villainy itself forswear't I must Forsake the court To do't or no is certain To me a break neck Happy star reign now Here comes Bohemia This is strange Methinks My favour here begins to warp Not speak Good day Camillo Hail most royal sir What is the news i ' th ' court None rare my lord The King hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province and a region Lov'd as he loves himself even now I met him With customary compliment when he Wafting his eyes to th ' contrary and falling A lip of much contempt speeds from me So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners I dare not know my lord How dare not Do not Do you know and dare not Be intelligent to me ' Tis thereabouts For to yourself what you do know you must And can not say you dare not Good Camillo Your chang'd complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine chang'd too

well How caught of me Make me not sighted like the basilisk I have look'd on thousands who have sped the better By my regard but kill'd none so Camillo- As you are certainly a gentleman thereto Clerk like experienc'd which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents ' noble names In whose success we are gentle- I beseech you If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform'd imprison't not In ignorant concealment I may not answer A sickness caught of me and yet I well I must be answer'd Dost thou hear Camillo I conjure thee by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge whereof the least Is not this suit of mine that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me how far off how near Which way to be prevented if to be If not how best to bear it Sir I will tell you Since I am charg'd in honour and by him That I think honourable Therefore mark my counsel Which must be ev'n as swiftly followed as I mean to utter it or both yourself and me Cry lost and so goodnight On good Camillo I am appointed him to murder you By whom Camillo By the King For what He thinks nay with all confidence he swears As he had seen ' t or been an instrument To vice you to't that you have touch'd his queen Forbiddenly O then my best blood turn To an infected jelly and my name Be yok'd with his that did betray the Best Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive and my approach be shunn'd Nay hated too worse than the great'st infection That e'er was heard or read Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly whose foundation Is pil'd upon his faith and will continue The standing of his body How should this grow I know not but I am sure ' tis safer to Avoid what 's grown than question how ' tis born If therefore you dare trust my honesty That lies enclosed in this trunk which you Shall bear along impawn'd away to night Your followers I will whisper to the business And will by twos and threes at several posterns Clear them o ' th ' city For myself I 'll put My fortunes to your service which are here By this discovery lost Be not uncertain For by the honour of my parents I Have utt'red truth which if you seek to prove I dare not stand by nor shall you be safer Than one condemn'd by the King 's own mouth thereon His execution sworn I do believe thee I saw his heart in 's face Give me thy hand Be pilot to me and thy places shall Still neighbour mine My ships are ready and My people did expect my hence departure Two days ago This jealousy Is for a precious creature as she 's rare Must it be great and as his person 's mighty Must it be violent and as he does conceive He is dishonour'd by a man which ever Profess'd to him why his revenges must In that be made more bitter Fear o'ershades me Good expedition be my friend and comfort The gracious Queen part of this theme but nothing Of his ill ta'en suspicion Come Camillo I will respect thee as a father if Thou bear'st my life off hence Let us

women 's faces Pray now What colour are your eyebrows Blue my lord Nay that 's a mock I have seen a lady 's nose That has been blue but not her eyebrows Hark ye The Queen your mother rounds apace We

have that good sir Come on sit down come on and do your best To fright me with your sprites you 're pow'rfull at it There was a man- Nay come sit down then on Dwelt by a churchyard- I will tell it softly Yond crickets shall not hear it Come on then And give't me in mine ear he met there his train Camillo with him Behind the tuft of pines I met them never Saw I men scour so on their way I ey'd them Even to their ships How blest am I In my just censure in my true opinion Alack for lesser knowledge How accurs'd In being so blest There may be in the cup A spider steep'd and one may drink depart And yet partake no venom for his knowledge Is not infected but if one present Th ' abhorr'd ingredient to his eye make known How he hath drunk he cracks his gorge his sides With violent hefts I have drunk and seen the spider Camillo was his help in this his pander There is a plot against my life my crown All 's true that is mistrusted That false villain Whom I employ'd was pre employ'd by him He has discover'd my design and I Remain a pinch'd thing yea a very trick For them to play at will How came the posterns So easily open By his great authority Which often hath no less prevail'd than so On your command I know't too well Give me the boy I am glad you did not nurse him Though he does bear some signs of me yet you Have too much blood in him What is this Sport Bear the boy hence

The most replenish'd villain in the world He were as much more villain you my lord Do but mistake You have mistook my lady Polixenes for Leontes O thou thing Which I 'll not call a creature of thy place Lest barbarism making me the precedent Should a like language use to all degrees And mannerly distinguishment leave out Betwixt the prince and beggar I have said She 's an adultress I have said with whom More she 's a traitor and Camillo is A federary with her and one that knows What she should shame to know herself But with her most vile principal- that she 's A bed swerver even as bad as those That vulgars give bold'st titles ay and privy To this their late escape No by my life Privy to none of this How will this grieve you When you shall come to clearer knowledge that You thus have publish'd me Gentle my lord You scarce can right me throughly then to say You did mistake No if I mistake In those foundations which I build upon The centre is not big enough to bear A school boy 's

come out this action I now go on Is for my better grace Adieu my lord I never wish'd to see you sorry now I trust I shall My women come you have leave Go do our bidding hence Beseech your Highness

lord- It is for you we speak not for ourselves You are abus'd and by some putter on That will be damn'd for't Would I knew the villain I would land damn him Be she honour flaw'd- I have three daughters the eldest is eleven The second and the third nine and some five If this prove true they 'll pay for ' t. By mine honour I 'll geld 'em all fourteen they shall not see To bring false generations They are co heirs And I had rather glib myself than they Should not produce fair issue Cease no more You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man 's nose but I do see't and feel't As you feel doing thus and see withal The instruments that feel If it be so We need no grave to bury honesty There 's not a grain of it the face to sweeten Of the whole dungy earth What Lack I credit I had rather you did lack than I my lord Upon this ground and more it would content me To have her honour true than your suspicion Be blam'd for't how you might Why what need we Commune with you of this but rather follow Our forceful instigation Our prerogative Calls not your counsels but our natural goodness Imparts this which if you- or stupified Or seeming so in skill- can not or will not Relish a truth like us inform yourselves We need no more of your advice The matter The loss the gain the ord'ring on't is all Properly ours And I wish my liege You had only in your silent judgment tried it Without more overture How could that be Either thou art most ignorant by age Or thou wert born a fool Camillo 's flight Added to their familiarity- Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture That lack'd sight only nought for approbation But only seeing all other circumstances Made up to th ' deed- doth push on this proceeding Yet for a greater confirmation- For in an act of this importance ' twere Most piteous to be wild- I have dispatch'd in post To sacred Delphos to Apollo 's temple Cleomenes and Dion whom you know Of stuff'd sufficiency Now from the oracle They will bring all whose spiritual counsel had Shall stop or spur me Have I done well Well done my lord Though I am satisfied and need no more Than what I know yet shall the oracle Give rest to th ' minds of others such as he Whose ignorant credulity will not Come up to th ' truth So have we thought it good From our free person she should be confin'd Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence Be left her to perform Come follow us We are to speak in public for this business Will raise us all Aside To laughter as I take it

shall be possible Swear by this sword Thou wilt perform my bidding I will my lord Mark and perform it- seest thou For the fail Of any point in't shall not only be Death to thyself but to thy lewd tongu'd wife Whom for this time we pardon We enjoin thee As thou art liegeman to us that thou carry This female bastard hence and that thou bear it To some remote and desert place quite out Of our dominions and that there thou leave it Without more mercy to it own protection And favour of the climate As by strange fortune It came to us I do in justice charge thee On thy soul 's peril and thy body 's torture That thou commend it strangely to some place Where chance may nurse or end it Take it up I swear to do this though a present death Had been more merciful Come on poor babe Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens To be thy nurses Wolves and bears they say Casting their savageness aside have done Like offices of pity Sir be prosperous In more than this deed does require And blessing Against this cruelty fight on thy side Poor thing condemn'd to loss Exit with the child No I 'll not rear Another 's issue Please your Highness posts From those you sent to th ' oracle are come An hour since Cleomenes and Dion Being well arriv'd from Delphos are both landed Hasting to th ' court So please you sir their speed Hath been beyond account Twenty three days They have been absent ' tis good speed foretells The great Apollo suddenly will have The truth of this appear Prepare you lords Summon a session that we may arraign Our most disloyal lady for as she hath Been publicly accus'd so shall she have A just and open trial While she lives My heart will be a burden to me Leave me And think upon my bidding Exeunt The climate 's delicate the air most sweet Fertile the isle the temple much surpassing The common praise it bears I shall report For most it caught me the celestial habits- Methinks I so should term them- and the reverence Of the grave wearers O the sacrifice How ceremonious solemn and unearthly It was i ' th ' off'ring But of all the burst And the ear deaf'ning voice o ' th ' oracle Kin to Jove 's thunder so surpris'd my sense That I was nothing If th ' event o ' th ' journey Prove as successful to the Queen- O be't so!- As it hath been to us rare pleasant speedy The time is worth the use on't Great Apollo Turn all to th ' best These proclamations So forcing faults upon Hermione I little like The violent carriage of it Will clear or end the business When the oracle- Thus by Apollo 's great divine seal'd up- Shall the contents discover something rare Even then will rush to knowledge Go fresh horses And gracious be the issue Exeunt This sessions to our great grief we pronounce Even pushes ' gainst our heart- the party tried The daughter of a king our wife and one Of us too much belov'd Let us be clear'd Of being tyrannous since we so openly Proceed in justice which shall have due course Even to the guilt or the purgation Produce the prisoner It is his Highness ' pleasure that the Queen Appear in person here in court Read the indictment Reads ' Hermione Queen to the worthy Leontes King of Sicilia thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason in committing adultery with Polixenes King of Bohemia and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the King thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open thou Hermione contrary to the faith and allegiance of true subject didst counsel and aid them for their better safety to fly away by night ' Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself it shall scarce boot me To say ' Not guilty ' Mine integrity Being counted falsehood shall as I express it Be so receiv'd But thus- if pow'rs divine Behold our human actions as they do I doubt not then but innocence shall make False accusation blush and tyranny Tremble at patience You my lord best know- Who least will seem to do so- my past life Hath been as continent as chaste as true As I am now unhappy which is more Than history can pattern though devis'd And play'd to take spectators for behold me- A fellow of the royal bed which owe A moiety of the throne a great king 's daughter The mother to a hopeful prince- here standing To prate and talk for life and honour fore Who please to come and hear For life I prize it As I weigh grief which I would spare for honour ' Tis a derivative from me to mine And only that I stand for I appeal To your own conscience sir before Polixenes Came to your court how I was in your grace How merited to be so since he came With what encounter so uncurrent I Have strain'd t ' appear thus if one jot beyond The bound of honour or in act or will That way inclining hard'ned be the hearts Of all that hear me and my near'st of kin Cry fie upon my grave I ne'er heard yet That any of these bolder vices wanted Less impudence to gainsay what they did Than to perform it first That 's true enough Though ' tis a saying sir not due to me You will not own it More than mistress of Which comes to me in name of fault I must not At all acknowledge For Polixenes With whom I am accus'd I do confess I lov'd him as in honour he requir'd With such a kind of love as might become A lady like me with a love even such So and no other as yourself commanded Which not to have done I think had been in me Both disobedience and ingratitude To you and toward your friend whose love had spoke Ever since it could speak from an infant freely That it was yours Now for conspiracy I know not how it tastes though it be dish'd For me to try how all I know of it Is that Camillo was an honest man And why he left your court the gods themselves Wotting no more than I are ignorant You knew of his departure as you know What you have underta'en to do in 's absence Sir You speak a language that I understand not My life stands in the level of your dreams Which I 'll lay down Your actions are my dreams You had a bastard by Polixenes And I but dream'd it As you were past all shame- Those of your fact are so- so past all truth Which to deny concerns more than avails for as Thy brat hath been cast out like to itself No father owning it- which is indeed More criminal in thee than it- so thou Shalt feel our justice in whose easiest passage Look for no less than death Sir spare your threats The bug which you would fright me with I seek To me can life be no commodity The crown and comfort of my life your favour I do give lost for I do feel it gone But know not how it went my second joy And first fruits of my body from his presence I am barr'd like one infectious my third comfort Starr'd most unluckily is from my breast- The innocent milk in it most innocent mouth- Hal'd out to murder myself on every post Proclaim'd a strumpet with immodest hatred The child bed privilege denied which ' longs To women of all fashion lastly hurried Here to this place i ' th ' open air before I have got strength of limit Now my liege Tell me what blessings I have here alive That I should fear to die Therefore proceed But yet hear this- mistake me not no life I prize it not a straw but for mine honour Which I would free- if I shall be condemn'd Upon surmises all proofs sleeping else But what your jealousies awake I tell you ' Tis rigour and not law Your honours all I do refer me to the oracle Apollo be my judge This your request Is altogether just Therefore bring forth And in Apollo 's name his oracle The Emperor of Russia was my father O that he were alive and here beholding His daughter 's trial that he did but see The flatness of my misery yet with eyes Of pity not revenge You here shall swear upon this sword of justice That you Cleomenes and Dion have Been both at Delphos and from thence have brought This seal'd up oracle by the hand deliver'd Of great Apollo 's priest and that since then You have not dar'd to break the holy seal Nor read the secrets in't Break up the seals and read Reads ' Hermione is chaste Polixenes blameless Camillo a true subject Leontes a jealous tyrant his innocent babe truly begotten and the King shall live without an heir if that which is lost be not found ' Now blessed be the great Apollo Praised Hast thou read truth Ay my lord even so As it is here set down There is no truth at all i ' th ' oracle The sessions shall proceed This is mere falsehood My lord the King the King What is the business O sir I shall be hated to report it The Prince your son with mere conceit and fear Of the Queen 's speed is gone How Gone Is dead Apollo 's angry and the heavens themselves Do strike at my injustice HERMIONE swoons How now there This news is mortal to the Queen Look down And see what death is doing Take her hence Her heart is but o'ercharg'd she will recover I have too much believ'd mine own suspicion Beseech you tenderly apply to her Some remedies for life Woe the while O cut my lace lest my heart cracking it Break too What fit is this good lady What studied torments tyrant hast for me What wheels racks fires what flaying boiling In leads or oils What old or newer torture Must I receive whose every word deserves To taste of thy most worst Thy tyranny Together working with thy jealousies Fancies too weak for boys too green and idle For girls of nine- O think what they have done And then run mad indeed stark mad for all Thy by gone fooleries were but spices of it That thou betray'dst Polixenes ' twas nothing That did but show thee of a fool inconstant And damnable ingrateful Nor was't much Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo 's honour To have him kill a king- poor trespasses More monstrous standing by whereof I reckon The casting forth to crows thy baby daughter To be or none or little though a devil Would have shed water out of fire ere done't Nor is't directly laid to thee the death Of the young Prince whose honourable thoughts- Thoughts high for one so tender- cleft the heart That could conceive a gross and foolish sire Blemish'd his gracious dam This is not no Laid to thy answer but the last- O lords When I have said cry ' Woe!'- the Queen the Queen The sweet'st dear'st creature 's dead and vengeance For't not dropp'd down yet The higher pow'rs forbid I say she 's dead I 'll swear't If word nor oath Prevail not go and see If you can bring Tincture or lustre in her lip her eye Heat outwardly or breath within I 'll serve you As I would do the gods But O thou tyrant Do not repent these things for they are heavier Than all thy woes can stir therefore betake thee To nothing but despair A thousand knees Ten thousand years together naked fasting Upon a barren mountain and still winter In storm perpetual could not move the gods To look that way thou wert Go on go on Thou canst not speak too much I have deserv'd All tongues to talk their bitt'rest Say no more Howe'er the business goes you have made fault I ' th ' boldness of your speech I am sorry for't All faults I make when I shall come to know them I do repent Alas I have show'd too much The rashness of a woman He is touch'd To th ' noble heart What 's gone and what 's past help Should be past grief Do not receive affliction At my petition I beseech you rather Let me be punish'd that have minded you Of what you should forget Now good my liege Sir royal sir forgive a foolish woman The love I bore your queen- lo fool again I 'll speak of her no more nor of your children I 'll not remember you of my own lord Who is lost too Take your patience to you And I 'll say nothing Thou didst speak but well When most the truth which I receive much better Than to be pitied of thee Prithee bring me To the dead bodies of my queen and son One grave shall be for both Upon them shall The causes of their death appear unto Our shame perpetual Once a day I 'll visit The chapel where they lie and tears shed there Shall be my recreation So long as nature Will bear up with this exercise so long I daily vow to use it Come and lead me To these sorrows Exeunt Thou art perfect then our ship hath touch'd upon The deserts of Bohemia Ay my lord and fear We have landed in ill time the skies look grimly And threaten present blusters In my conscience The heavens with that we have in hand are angry And frown upon ' s. Their sacred wills be done Go get aboard Look to thy bark I 'll not be long before I call upon thee Make your best haste and go not Too far i ' th ' land ' tis like to be loud weather Besides this place is famous for the creatures Of prey that keep upon't Go thou away I 'll follow instantly I am glad at heart To be so rid o ' th ' business Exit Come poor babe I have heard but not believ'd the spirits o ' th ' dead May walk again If such thing be thy mother Appear'd to me last night for ne'er was dream So like a waking To me comes a creature Sometimes her head on one side some another- I never saw a vessel of like sorrow So fill'd and so becoming in pure white robes Like very sanctity she did approach My cabin where I lay thrice bow'd before me And gasping to begin some speech her eyes Became two spouts the fury spent anon Did this break from her ' Good Antigonus Since fate against thy better disposition Hath made thy person for the thrower out Of my poor babe according to thine oath Places remote enough are in Bohemia There weep and leave it crying and for the babe Is counted lost for ever Perdita I prithee call't For this ungentle business Put on thee by my lord thou ne'er shalt see Thy wife Paulina more ' so with shrieks She melted into air Affrighted much I did in time collect myself and thought This was so and no slumber Dreams are toys Yet for this once yea superstitiously I will be squar'd by this I do believe Hermione hath suffer'd death and that Apollo would this being indeed the issue Of King Polixenes it should here be laid Either for life or death upon the earth Of its right father Blossom speed thee well I would there were no age between ten and three and twenty or that youth would sleep out the rest for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child wronging the ancientry stealing fighting- Horns Hark you now Would any but these boil'd brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt this weather They have scar'd away two of my best sheep which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master If any where I have them ' tis by the sea side browsing of ivy Good luck an't be thy will What have we here Taking up the child Mercy on 's a barne A very pretty barne A boy or a child I wonder A pretty one a very pretty one- sure some scape Though I am not bookish yet I can read waiting gentlewoman in the scape This has been some stair work some trunk work some behind door work they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here I 'll take it up for pity yet I 'll tarry till my son come he halloo'd but even now Whoa ho hoa Hilloa loa What art so near If thou'lt see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten come hither What ail'st thou man I have seen two such sights by sea and by land But I am not to say it is a sea for it is now the sky betwixt the firmament and it you can not thrust a bodkin 's point Why boy how is it I would you did but see how it chafes how it rages how it takes up the shore But that 's not to the point O the most piteous cry of the poor souls Sometimes to see 'em and not to see 'em now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast and anon swallowed with yeast and froth as you 'd thrust a cork into a hogshead And then for the land service- to see how the bear tore out his shoulder bone how he cried to me for help and said his name was Antigonus a nobleman But to make an end of the ship- to see how the sea flap dragon'd it but first how the poor souls roared and the sea mock'd them and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mock'd him both roaring louder than the sea or weather Name of mercy when was this boy Now now I have not wink'd since I saw these sights the men are not yet cold under water nor the bear half din'd on the gentleman he 's at it now Would I had been by to have help'd the old man I would you had been by the ship side to have help'd her there your charity would have lack'd footing Heavy matters heavy matters But look thee here boy Now bless thyself thou met'st with things dying I with things new born Here 's a sight for thee look thee a bearing cloth for a squire 's child Look thee here take up take up boy open't So let 's see- it was told me I should be rich by the fairies This is some changeling Open't What 's within boy You 're a made old man if the sins of your youth are forgiven you you 're well to live Gold all gold This is fairy gold boy and ' twill prove so Up with't keep it close Home home the next way We are lucky boy and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy Let my sheep go Come good boy the next way home Go you the next way with your findings I 'll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten They are never curst but when they are hungry If there be any of him left I 'll bury it That 's a good deed If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is fetch me to th ' sight of him Marry will I and you shall help to put him i ' th ' ground ' Tis a lucky day boy and we 'll do good deeds on't I that please some try all both joy and terror Of good and bad that makes and unfolds error Now take upon me in the name of Time To use my wings Impute it not a crime To me or my swift passage that I slide O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried Of that wide gap since it is in my pow'r To o'erthrow law and in one self born hour To plant and o'erwhelm custom Let me pass The same I am ere ancient'st order was Or what is now receiv'd I witness to The times that brought them in so shall I do To th ' freshest things now reigning and make stale The glistering of this present as my tale Now seems to it Your patience this allowing I turn my glass and give my scene such growing As you had slept between Leontes leaving- Th ' effects of his fond jealousies so grieving That he shuts up himself- imagine me Gentle spectators that I now may be In fair Bohemia and remember well I mention'd a son o ' th ' King 's which Florizel I now name to you and with speed so pace To speak of Perdita now grown in grace Equal with wond'ring What of her ensues I list not prophesy but let Time 's news Be known when ' tis brought forth A shepherd 's daughter And what to her adheres which follows after Is th ' argument of Time Of this allow If ever you have spent time worse ere now If never yet that Time himself doth say He wishes earnestly you never may Exit I pray thee good Camillo be no more importunate ' tis a sickness denying thee anything a death to grant this It is fifteen years since I saw my country though I have for the most part been aired abroad I desire to lay my bones there Besides the penitent King my master hath sent for me to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay or I o'erween to think so which is another spur to my departure As thou lov'st me Camillo wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done which if I have not enough considered- as too much I cannot- to be more thankful to thee shall be my study and my profit therein the heaping friendships Of that fatal country Sicilia prithee speak no more whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent as thou call'st him and reconciled king my brother whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented Say to me when saw'st thou the Prince Florizel my son Kings are no less unhappy their issue not being gracious than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues Sir it is three days since I saw the Prince What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared I have considered so much Camillo and with some care so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness from whom I have this intelligence that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd- a man they say that from very nothing and beyond the imagination of his neighbours is grown into an unspeakable estate I have heard sir of such a man who hath a daughter of most rare note The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage That 's likewise part of my intelligence but I fear the angle that plucks our son thither Thou shalt accompany us to the place where we will not appearing what we are have some question with the shepherd from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son 's resort thither Prithee be my present partner in this business and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia I willingly obey your command My best Camillo We must disguise ourselves Let me see every ' leven wether tods every tod yields pound and odd shilling fifteen hundred shorn what comes the wool to Aside If the springe hold the cock 's mine I can not do ' t without counters Let me see what am I to buy for our sheep shearing feast Three pound of sugar five pound of currants rice- what will this sister of mine do with rice But my father hath made her mistress of the feast and she lays it on She hath made me four and twenty nosegays for the shearers- three man song men all and very good ones but they are most of them means and bases but one Puritan amongst them and he sings psalms to hornpipes I must have saffron to colour the warden pies mace dates- none that 's out of my note nutmegs seven race or two of ginger but that I may beg four pound of prunes and as many of raisins o ' th ' sun Grovelling on the ground O that ever I was born I ' th ' name of me O help me help me Pluck but off these rags and then death death Alack poor soul thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee rather than have these off O sir the loathsomeness of them offend me more than the stripes I have received which are mighty ones and millions Alas poor man a million of beating may come to a great matter I am robb'd sir and beaten my money and apparel ta'en from me and these detestable things put upon me What by a horseman or a footman A footman sweet sir a footman Indeed he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee if this be a horseman 's coat it hath seen very hot service Lend me thy hand I 'll help thee Come lend me thy hand Helping him up O good sir tenderly O Alas poor soul O good sir softly good sir I fear sir my shoulder blade is out How now Canst stand Softly dear sir Picks his pocket good sir softly You ha ' done me a charitable office Dost lack any money I have a little money for thee No good sweet sir no I beseech you sir I have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence unto whom I was going I shall there have money or anything I want Offer me no money I pray you that kills my heart What manner of fellow was he that robb'd you A fellow sir that I have known to go about with troll my dames I knew him once a servant of the Prince I can not tell good sir for which of his virtues it was but he was certainly whipt out of the court His vices you would say there 's no virtue whipt out of the court They cherish it to make it stay there and yet it will no more but abide Vices I would say sir I know this man well he hath been since an ape bearer then a process server a bailiff then he compass'd a motion of the Prodigal Son and married a tinker 's wife within a mile where my land and living lies and having flown over many knavish professions he settled only in rogue Some call him Autolycus Out upon him prig for my life prig He haunts wakes fairs and bear baitings Very true sir he sir he that 's the rogue that put me into this apparel Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia if you had but look'd big and spit at him he 'd have run I must confess to you sir I am no fighter I am false of heart that way and that he knew I warrant him How do you now Sweet sir much better than I was I can stand and walk I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman 's Shall I bring thee on the way No good fac'd sir no sweet sir Then fare thee well I must go buy spices for our sheep shearing Prosper you sweet sir Exit CLOWN Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice I 'll be with you at your sheep shearing too If I make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep let me be unroll'd and my name put in the book of virtue These your unusual weeds to each part of you Do give a life- no shepherdess but Flora Peering in April 's front This your sheep shearing Is as a meeting of the petty gods And you the Queen on't Sir my gracious lord To chide at your extremes it not becomes me- O pardon that I name them Your high self The gracious mark o ' th ' land you have obscur'd With a swain 's wearing and me poor lowly maid Most goddess like prank'd up But that our feasts In every mess have folly and the feeders Digest it with a custom I should blush To see you so attir'd swoon I think To show myself a glass I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father 's ground Now Jove afford you cause To me the difference forges dread your greatness Hath not been us'd to fear Even now I tremble To think your father by some accident Should pass this way as you did O the Fates How would he look to see his work so noble Vilely bound up What would he say Or how Should I in these my borrowed flaunts behold The sternness of his presence Apprehend Nothing but jollity The gods themselves Humbling their deities to love have taken The shapes of beasts upon them Jupiter Became a bull and bellow'd the green Neptune A ram and bleated and the fire rob'd god Golden Apollo a poor humble swain As I seem now Their transformations Were never for a piece of beauty rarer Nor in a way so chaste since my desires Run not before mine honour nor my lusts Burn hotter than my faith O but sir Your resolution can not hold when ' tis Oppos'd as it must be by th ' pow'r of the King One of these two must be necessities Which then will speak that you must change this purpose Or I my life Thou dearest Perdita With these forc'd thoughts I prithee darken not The mirth o ' th ' feast Or I 'll be thine my fair Or not my father 's for I can not be Mine own nor anything to any if I be not thine To this I am most constant Though destiny say no Be merry gentle Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing That you behold the while Your guests are coming Lift up your countenance as it were the day Of celebration of that nuptial which We two have sworn shall come O Lady Fortune Stand you auspicious See your guests approach Address yourself to entertain them sprightly And let 's be red with mirth Fie daughter When my old wife liv'd upon This day she was both pantler butler cook Both dame and servant welcom'd all serv'd all Would sing her song and dance her turn now here At upper end o ' th ' table now i ' th ' middle On his shoulder and his her face o ' fire With labour and the thing she took to quench it She would to each one sip You are retired As if you were a feasted one and not The hostess of the meeting Pray you bid These unknown friends to 's welcome for it is A way to make us better friends more known Come quench your blushes and present yourself That which you are Mistress o ' th ' Feast Come on And bid us welcome to your sheep shearing As your good flock shall prosper To POLIXENES Sir welcome It is my father 's will I should take on me The hostess ship o ' th ' day To CAMILLO You 're welcome sir Give me those flow'rs there Dorcas Reverend sirs For you there 's rosemary and rue these keep Seeming and savour all the winter long Grace and remembrance be to you both And welcome to our shearing Shepherdess- A fair one are you- well you fit our ages With flow'rs of winter Sir the year growing ancient Not yet on summer 's death nor on the birth Of trembling winter the fairest flow'rs o ' th ' season Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors Which some call nature 's bastards Of that kind Our rustic garden 's barren and I care not To get slips of them Wherefore gentle maiden Do you neglect them For I have heard it said There is an art which in their piedness shares With great creating nature Say there be Yet nature is made better by no mean But nature makes that mean so over that art Which you say adds to nature is an art That nature makes You see sweet maid we marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race This is an art Which does mend nature- change it rather but The art itself is nature So it is Then make your garden rich in gillyvors And do not call them bastards I 'll not put The dibble in earth to set one slip of them No more than were I painted I would wish This youth should say ' twere well and only therefore Desire to breed by me Here 's flow'rs for you Hot lavender mints savory marjoram The marigold that goes to bed wi ' th ' sun And with him rises weeping these are flow'rs Of middle summer and I think they are given To men of middle age Y'are very welcome I should leave grazing were I of your flock And only live by gazing Out alas You 'd be so lean that blasts of January Would blow you through and through Now my fair'st friend I would I had some flow'rs o ' th ' spring that might Become your time of day- and yours and yours That wear upon your virgin branches yet Your maidenheads growing O Proserpina From the flowers now that frighted thou let'st fall From Dis 's waggon!- daffodils That come before the swallow dares and take The winds of March with beauty violets dim But sweeter than the lids of Juno 's eyes Or Cytherea 's breath pale primroses That die unmarried ere they can behold Bright Phoebus in his strength- a malady Most incident to maids bold oxlips and The crown imperial lilies of all kinds The flow'r de luce being one O these I lack To make you garlands of and my sweet friend To strew him o'er and o'er What like a corse No like a bank for love to lie and play on Not like a corse or if- not to be buried But quick and in mine arms Come take your flow'rs Methinks I play as I have seen them do In Whitsun pastorals Sure this robe of mine Does change my disposition What you do Still betters what is done When you speak sweet I 'd have you do it ever When you sing I 'd have you buy and sell so so give alms Pray so and for the ord'ring your affairs To sing them too When you do dance I wish you A wave o ' th ' sea that you might ever do Nothing but that move still still so And own no other function Each your doing So singular in each particular Crowns what you are doing in the present deeds That all your acts are queens O Doricles Your praises are too large But that your youth And the true blood which peeps fairly through't Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd With wisdom I might fear my Doricles You woo'd me the false way I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to't But come our dance I pray Your hand my Perdita so turtles pair That never mean to part I 'll swear for 'em This is the prettiest low born lass that ever Ran on the green sward nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself Too noble for this place He tells her something That makes her blood look out Good sooth she is The queen of curds and cream Come on strike up Mopsa must be your mistress marry garlic To mend her kissing with Now in good time Not a word a word we stand upon our manners Come strike up Music Pray good shepherd what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter They call him Doricles and boasts himself To have a worthy feeding but I have it Upon his own report and I believe it He looks like sooth He says he loves my daughter I think so too for never gaz'd the moon Upon the water as he 'll stand and read As ' twere my daughter 's eyes and to be plain I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best She dances featly So she does any thing though I report it That should be silent If young Doricles Do light upon her she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of O master if you did but hear the pedlar at the door you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe no the bagpipe could not move you He sings several tunes faster than you 'll tell money he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men 's ears grew to his tunes He could never come better he shall come in I love a ballad but even too well if it be doleful matter merrily set down or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves He has the prettiest love songs for maids so without bawdry which is strange with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings ' jump her and thump her ' and where some stretch mouth'd rascal would as it were mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter he makes the maid to answer ' Whoop do me no harm good man'- puts him off slights him with ' Whoop do me no harm good man ' This is a brave fellow Believe me thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow Has he any unbraided wares He hath ribbons of all the colours i ' th ' rainbow points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle though they come to him by th ' gross inkles caddisses cambrics lawns Why he sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses you would think a smock were she angel he so chants to the sleeve hand and the work about the square on't Prithee bring him in and let him approach singing Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes You have of these pedlars that have more in them than you 'd think sister Ay good brother or go about to think If I were not in love with Mopsa thou shouldst take no money of me but being enthrall'd as I am it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves I was promis'd them against the feast but they come not too late now He hath promis'd you more than that or there be liars He hath paid you all he promis'd you May be he has paid you more which will shame you to give him again Is there no manners left among maids Will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces Is there not milking time when you are going to bed or kiln hole to whistle off these secrets but you must be tittle tattling before all our guests ' Tis well they are whisp'ring Clammer your tongues and not a word more I have done Come you promis'd me a tawdry lace and a pair of sweet gloves Have I not told thee how I was cozen'd by the way and lost all my money And indeed sir there are cozeners abroad therefore it behoves men to be wary Fear not thou man thou shalt lose nothing here I hope so sir for I have about me many parcels of charge What hast here Ballads Pray now buy some I love a ballad in print a life for then we are sure they are true Here 's one to a very doleful tune how a usurer 's wife was brought to bed of twenty money bags at a burden and how she long'd to eat adders ' heads and toads carbonado'd Is it true think you Very true and but a month old Bless me from marrying a usurer Here 's the midwife 's name to't one Mistress Taleporter and five or six honest wives that were present Why should I carry lies abroad Pray you now buy it Come on lay it by and let 's first see moe ballads we 'll buy the other things anon Here 's another ballad of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April forty thousand fathom above water and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids It was thought she was a woman and was turn'd into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that lov'd her The ballad is very pitiful and as true Is it true too think you Five justices ' hands at it and witnesses more than my pack will hold Lay it by too Another This is a merry ballad but a very pretty one Let 's have some merry ones Why this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of ' Two maids wooing a man ' There 's scarce a maid westward but she sings it ' tis in request I can tell you can both sing it If thou'lt bear a part thou shalt hear ' tis in three parts We had the tune on't a month ago I can bear my part you must know ' tis my occupation Have at it with you Get you hence for I must go Whither O whither Whither It becomes thy oath full well Me too Let me go thither Or thou goest to th ' grange or mill If to either thou dost ill Neither What neither Neither Thou hast sworn my love to be Thou hast sworn it more to me We 'll have this song out anon by ourselves my father and the gentlemen are in sad talk and we 'll not trouble them Come bring away thy pack after me Wenches I 'll buy for you both Pedlar let 's have the first choice Follow me girls And you shall pay well for 'em Master there is three carters three shepherds three neat herds three swineherds that have made themselves all men of hair they call themselves Saltiers and they have dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols because they are not in't but they themselves are o ' th ' mind if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling it will please plentifully Away We 'll none on't here has been too much homely foolery already I know sir we weary you You weary those that refresh us Pray let 's see these four threes of herdsmen One three of them by their own report sir hath danc'd before the King and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by th ' squier Leave your prating since these good men are pleas'd let them come in but quickly now Why they stay at door sir Exit To SHEPHERD O father you 'll know more of that Old sir I know She prizes not such trifles as these are The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd Up in my heart which I have given already But not deliver'd O hear me breathe my life Before this ancient sir whom it should seem Hath sometime lov'd I take thy hand- this hand As soft as dove 's down and as white as it Or Ethiopian 's tooth or the fann'd snow that 's bolted By th ' northern blasts twice o'er What follows this How prettily the young swain seems to wash The hand was fair before I have put you out But to your protestation let me hear What you profess Do and be witness to't And this my neighbour too And he and more Than he and men- the earth the heavens and all That were I crown'd the most imperial monarch Thereof most worthy were I the fairest youth That ever made eye swerve had force and knowledge More than was ever man 's I would not prize them Without her love for her employ them all Commend them and condemn them to her service Or to their own perdition Fairly offer'd This shows a sound affection But my daughter Say you the like to him I can not speak So well nothing so well no nor mean better By th ' pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out The purity of his Take hands a bargain And friends unknown you shall bear witness to't I give my daughter to him and will make Her portion equal his O that must be I ' th ' virtue of your daughter One being dead I shall have more than you can dream of yet Enough then for your wonder But come on Contract us fore these witnesses Come your hand And daughter yours Soft swain awhile beseech you Have you a father I have but what of him Knows he of this He neither does nor shall Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table Pray you once more Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs Is he not stupid With age and alt'ring rheums Can he speak hear Know man from man dispute his own estate Lies he not bed rid and again does nothing But what he did being childish No good sir He has his health and ampler strength indeed Than most have of his age By my white beard You offer him if this be so a wrong Something unfilial Reason my son Should choose himself a wife but as good reason The father- all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity- should hold some counsel In such a business I yield all this But for some other reasons my grave sir Which ' tis not fit you know I not acquaint My father of this business Let him know't He shall not Prithee let him No he must not Let him my son he shall not need to grieve At knowing of thy choice Come come he must not Mark our contract Discovering himself Mark your divorce young sir Whom son I dare not call thou art too base To be acknowledg'd- thou a sceptre 's heir That thus affects a sheep hook Thou old traitor I am sorry that by hanging thee I can but Shorten thy life one week And thou fresh piece Of excellent witchcraft who of force must know The royal fool thou cop'st with- O my heart I 'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers and made More homely than thy state For thee fond boy If I may ever know thou dost but sigh That thou no more shalt see this knack- as never I mean thou shalt- we 'll bar thee from succession Not hold thee of our blood no not our kin Farre than Deucalion off Mark thou my words Follow us to the court Thou churl for this time Though full of our displeasure yet we free thee From the dead blow of it And you enchantment Worthy enough a herdsman- yea him too That makes himself but for our honour therein Unworthy thee- if ever henceforth thou These rural latches to his entrance open Or hoop his body more with thy embraces I will devise a death as cruel for thee As thou art tender to't Exit Even here undone I was not much afeard for once or twice I was about to speak and tell him plainly The self same sun that shines upon his court Hides not his visage from our cottage but Looks on alike To FLORIZEL Will't please you sir be gone I told you what would come of this Beseech you Of your own state take care This dream of mine- Being now awake I 'll queen it no inch farther But milk my ewes and weep Why how now father Speak ere thou diest I can not speak nor think Nor dare to know that which I know To FLORIZEL O sir You have undone a man of fourscore three That thought to fill his grave in quiet yea To die upon the bed my father died To lie close by his honest bones but now Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me Where no priest shovels in dust To PERDITA O cursed wretch That knew'st this was the Prince and wouldst adventure To mingle faith with him!- Undone undone If I might die within this hour I have liv'd To die when I desire Exit Why look you so upon me I am but sorry not afeard delay'd But nothing alt'red What I was I am More straining on for plucking back not following My leash unwillingly Gracious my lord You know your father 's temper At this time He will allow no speech- which I do guess You do not purpose to him- and as hardly Will he endure your sight as yet I fear Then till the fury of his Highness settle Come not before him I not purpose it I think Camillo Even he my lord How often have I told you ' twould be thus How often said my dignity would last But till ' twere known It can not fail but by The violation of my faith and then Let nature crush the sides o ' th ' earth together And mar the seeds within Lift up thy looks From my succession wipe me father I Am heir to my affection Be advis'd I am- and by my fancy if my reason Will thereto be obedient I have reason If not my senses better pleas'd with madness Do bid it welcome This is desperate sir So call it but it does fulfil my vow I needs must think it honesty Camillo Not for Bohemia nor the pomp that may Be thereat glean'd for all the sun sees or The close earth wombs or the profound seas hides In unknown fathoms will I break my oath To this my fair belov'd Therefore I pray you As you have ever been my father 's honour'd friend When he shall miss me- as in faith I mean not To see him any more- cast your good counsels Upon his passion Let myself and Fortune Tug for the time to come This you may know And so deliver I am put to sea With her who here I can not hold on shore And most opportune to her need I have A vessel rides fast by but not prepar'd For this design What course I mean to hold Shall nothing benefit your knowledge nor Concern me the reporting O my lord I would your spirit were easier for advice Or stronger for your need Hark Perdita Takes her aside To CAMILLO I 'll hear you by and by He 's irremovable Resolv'd for flight Now were I happy if His going I could frame to serve my turn Save him from danger do him love and honour Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia And that unhappy king my master whom I so much thirst to see Now good Camillo I am so fraught with curious business that I leave out ceremony Sir I think You have heard of my poor services i ' th ' love That I have borne your father Very nobly Have you deserv'd It is my father 's music To speak your deeds not little of his care To have them recompens'd as thought on Well my lord If you may please to think I love the King And through him what 's nearest to him which is Your gracious self embrace but my direction If your more ponderous and settled project May suffer alteration on mine honour I 'll point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your Highness where you may Enjoy your mistress from the whom I see There 's no disjunction to be made but by As heavens forfend your ruin- marry her And with my best endeavours in your absence Your discontenting father strive to qualify And bring him up to liking How Camillo May this almost a miracle be done That I may call thee something more than man And after that trust to thee Have you thought on A place whereto you 'll go Not any yet But as th ' unthought on accident is guilty To what we wildly do so we profess Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies Of every wind that blows Then list to me This follows if you will not change your purpose But undergo this flight make for Sicilia And there present yourself and your fair princess- For so I see she must be- fore Leontes She shall be habited as it becomes The partner of your bed Methinks I see Leontes opening his free arms and weeping His welcomes forth asks thee there ' Son forgiveness ' As ' twere i ' th ' father 's person kisses the hands Of your fresh princess o'er and o'er divides him ' Twixt his unkindness and his kindness- th ' one He chides to hell and bids the other grow Faster than thought or time Worthy Camillo What colour for my visitation shall I Hold up before him Sent by the King your father To greet him and to give him comforts Sir The manner of your bearing towards him with What you as from your father shall deliver Things known betwixt us three I 'll write you down The which shall point you forth at every sitting What you must say that he shall not perceive But that you have your father 's bosom there And speak his very heart I am bound to you There is some sap in this A course more promising Than a wild dedication of yourselves To unpath'd waters undream'd shores most certain To miseries enough no hope to help you But as you shake off one to take another Nothing so certain as your anchors who Do their best office if they can but stay you Where you 'll be loath to be Besides you know Prosperity 's the very bond of love Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction alters One of these is true I think affliction may subdue the cheek But not take in the mind Yea say you so There shall not at your father 's house these seven years Be born another such My good Camillo She is as forward of her breeding as She is i ' th ' rear o ' our birth I can not say ' tis pity She lacks instructions for she seems a mistress To most that teach Your pardon sir for this I 'll blush you thanks My prettiest Perdita But O the thorns we stand upon Camillo- Preserver of my father now of me The medicine of our house- how shall we do We are not furnish'd like Bohemia 's son Nor shall appear in Sicilia My lord Fear none of this I think you know my fortunes Do all lie there It shall be so my care To have you royally appointed as if The scene you play were mine For instance sir That you may know you shall not want- one word Ha ha what a fool Honesty is and Trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman I have sold all my trumpery not a counterfeit stone not a ribbon glass pomander brooch table book ballad knife tape glove shoe tie bracelet horn ring to keep my pack from fasting They throng who should buy first as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture and what I saw to my good use I rememb'red My clown who wants but something to be a reasonable man grew so in love with the wenches ' song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears You might have pinch'd a placket it was senseless ' twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse I would have fil'd keys off that hung in chains No hearing no feeling but my sir 's song and admiring the nothing of it So that in this time of lethargy I pick'd and cut most of their festival purses and had not the old man come in with whoobub against his daughter and the King 's son and scar'd my choughs from the chaff I had not left a purse alive in the whole army Nay but my letters by this means being there So soon as you arrive shall clear that doubt And those that you 'll procure from King Leontes Shall satisfy your father Happy be you All that you speak shows fair seeing AUTOLYCUS Who have we here We 'll make an instrument of this omit Nothing may give us aid Aside If they have overheard me now- why hanging How now good fellow Why shak'st thou so Fear not man here 's no harm intended to thee I am a poor fellow sir Why be so still here 's nobody will steal that from thee Yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange therefore discase thee instantly- thou must think there 's a necessity in't- and change garments with this gentleman Though the pennyworth on his side be the worst yet hold thee there 's some boot Giving money I am a poor fellow sir Aside I know ye well enough Nay prithee dispatch The gentleman is half flay'd already Are you in camest sir Aside I smell the trick on't Dispatch I prithee Indeed I have had earnest but I can not with conscience take it Unbuckle unbuckle I see the play so lies That I must bear a part No remedy Have you done there Should I now meet my father He would not call me son Nay you shall have no hat Adieu sir O Perdita what have we twain forgot Pray you a word They converse apart Aside What I do next shall be to tell the King Of this escape and whither they are bound Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail To force him after in whose company I shall re view Sicilia for whose sight I have a woman 's longing Fortune speed us Thus we set on Camillo to th ' sea side The swifter speed the better I understand the business I hear it To have an open ear a quick eye and a nimble hand is necessary for a cut purse a good nose is requisite also to smell out work for th ' other senses I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive What an exchange had this been without boot What a boot is here with this exchange Sure the gods do this year connive at us and we may do anything extempore The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity- stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels If I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the King withal I would not do't I hold it the more knavery to conceal it and therein am I constant to my profession See see what a man you are now There is no other way but to tell the King she 's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood Nay but hear me Nay- but hear me Go to then She being none of your flesh and blood your flesh and blood has not offended the King and so your flesh and blood is not to be punish'd by him Show those things you found about her those secret things- all but what she has with her This being done let the law go whistle I warrant you I will tell the King all every word- yea and his son 's pranks too who I may say is no honest man neither to his father nor to me to go about to make me the King 's brother in law Indeed brother in law was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce Aside Very wisely puppies Well let us to the King There is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard Aside I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master Pray heartily he be at palace Aside Though I am not naturally honest I am so sometimes by chance Let me pocket up my pedlar 's excrement Takes off his false beard How now rustics Whither are you bound To th ' palace an it like your worship Your affairs there what with whom the condition of that fardel the place of your dwelling your names your ages of what having breeding and anything that is fitting to be known- discover We are but plain fellows sir A lie you are rough and hairy Let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin not stabbing steel therefore they do not give us the lie Your worship had like to have given us one if you had not taken yourself with the manner Are you a courtier an't like you sir Whether it like me or no I am a courtier Seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings Hath not my gait in it the measure of the court Receives not thy nose court odour from me Reflect I not on thy baseness court contempt Think'st thou for that I insinuate that toaze from thee thy business I am therefore no courtier I am courtier cap a pe and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon I command the to open thy affair My business sir is to the King What advocate hast thou to him I know not an't like you Advocate 's the court word for a pheasant say you have none None sir I have no pheasant cock nor hen How blessed are we that are not simple men Yet nature might have made me as these are Therefore I will not disdain This can not be but a great courtier His garments are rich but he wears them not handsomely He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical A great man I 'll warrant I know by the picking on 's teeth The fardel there What 's i ' th ' fardel Wherefore that box Sir there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the King and which he shall know within this hour if I may come to th ' speech of him Age thou hast lost thy labour Why Sir The King is not at the palace he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for if thou be'st capable of things serious thou must know the King is full of grief So ' tis said sir- about his son that should have married a shepherd 's daughter If that shepherd be not in hand fast let him fly the curses he shall have the tortures he shall feel will break the back of man the heart of monster Think you so sir Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter but those that are germane to him though remov'd fifty times shall all come under the hangman- which though it be great pity yet it is necessary An old sheep whistling rogue a ram tender to offer to have his daughter come into grace Some say he shall be ston'd but that death is too soft for him say I. Draw our throne into a sheep cote!- all deaths are too few the sharpest too easy Has the old man e'er a son sir do you hear an't like you sir He has a son- who shall be flay'd alive then ' nointed over with honey set on the head of a wasp 's nest then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead then recover'd again with aqua vitae or some other hot infusion then raw as he is and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims shall he be set against a brick wall the sun looking with a southward eye upon him where he is to behold him with flies blown to death But what talk we of these traitorly rascals whose miseries are to be smil'd at their offences being so capital Tell me for you seem to be honest plain men what you have to the King Being something gently consider'd I 'll bring you where he is aboard tender your persons to his presence whisper him in your behalfs and if it be in man besides the King to effect your suits here is man shall do it He seems to be of great authority Close with him give him gold and though authority be a stubborn bear yet he is oft led by the nose with gold Show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand and no more ado Remember- ston'd and flay'd alive An't please you sir to undertake the business for us here is that gold I have I 'll make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you After I have done what I promised Ay sir Well give me the moiety Are you a party in this business In some sort sir but though my case be a pitiful one I hope I shall not be flay'd out of it O that 's the case of the shepherd 's son Hang him he 'll be made an example Comfort good comfort We must to the King and show our strange sights He must know ' tis none of your daughter nor my sister we are gone else Sir I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed and remain as he says your pawn till it be brought you I will trust you Walk before toward the sea side go on the right hand I will but look upon the hedge and follow you We are blest in this man as I may say even blest Let 's before as he bids us He was provided to do us good Exeunt SHEPHERD and CLOWN If I had a mind to be honest I see Fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth I am courted now with a double occasion- gold and a means to do the Prince my master good which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement I will bring these two moles these blind ones aboard him If he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the King concerns him nothing let him call me rogue for being so far officious for I am proof against that title and what shame else belongs to't To him will I present them There may be matter in it Exit Sir you have done enough and have perform'd A saint like sorrow No fault could you make Which you have not redeem'd indeed paid down More penitence than done trespass At the last Do as the heavens have done forget your evil With them forgive yourself Whilst I remember Her and her virtues I can not forget My blemishes in them and so still think of The wrong I did myself which was so much That heirless it hath made my kingdom and Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man Bred his hopes out of True too true my lord If one by one you wedded all the world Or from the all that are took something good To make a perfect woman she you kill'd Would be unparallel'd I think so Kill'd She I kill'd I did so but thou strik'st me Sorely to say I did It is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought Now good now Say so but seldom Not at all good lady You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and grac'd Your kindness better You are one of those Would have him we d again If you would not so You pity not the state nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name consider little What dangers by his Highness ' fail of issue May drop upon his kingdom and devour Incertain lookers on What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well What holier than for royalty 's repair For present comfort and for future good To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to't There is none worthy Respecting her that 's gone Besides the gods Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes For has not the divine Apollo said Is't not the tenour of his oracle That King Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found Which that it shall Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me who on my life Did perish with the infant ' Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary Oppose against their wills To LEONTES Care not for issue The crown will find an heir Great Alexander Left his to th ' worthiest so his successor Was like to be the best Good Paulina Who hast the memory of Hermione I know in honour O that ever I Had squar'd me to thy counsel Then even now I might have look'd upon my queen 's full eyes Have taken treasure from her lips- And left them More rich for what they yielded Thou speak'st truth No more such wives therefore no wife One worse And better us'd would make her sainted spirit Again possess her corpse and on this stage Where we offend her now appear soul vex'd And begin ' Why to me'- Had she such power She had just cause She had and would incense me To murder her I married I should so Were I the ghost that walk'd I 'd bid you mark Her eye and tell me for what dull part in't You chose her then I 'd shriek that even your ears Should rift to hear me and the words that follow'd Should be ' Remember mine ' Stars stars And all eyes else dead coals Fear thou no wife I 'll have no wife Paulina Will you swear Never to marry but by my free leave Never Paulina so be blest my spirit Then good my lords bear witness to his oath You tempt him over much Unless another As like Hermione as is her picture Affront his eye Good madam- I have done Yet if my lord will marry- if you will sir No remedy but you will- give me the office To choose you a queen She shall not be so young As was your former but she shall be such As walk'd your first queen 's ghost it should take joy To see her in your arms My true Paulina We shall not marry till thou bid'st us That Shall be when your first queen 's again in breath Never till then One that gives out himself Prince Florizel Son of Polixenes with his princess- she The fairest I have yet beheld- desires access To your high presence What with him He comes not Like to his father 's greatness His approach So out of circumstance and sudden tells us ' Tis not a visitation fram'd but forc'd By need and accident What train But few And those but mean His princess say you with him Ay the most peerless piece of earth I think That e'er the sun shone bright on O Hermione As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone so must thy grave Give way to what 's seen now Sir you yourself Have said and writ so but your writing now Is colder than that theme ' She had not been Nor was not to be equall'd ' Thus your verse Flow'd with her beauty once ' tis shrewdly ebb'd To say you have seen a better Pardon madam The one I have almost forgot- your pardon The other when she has obtain'd your eye Will have your tongue too This is a creature Would she begin a sect might quench the zeal Of all professors else make proselytes Of who she but bid follow How not women Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man men that she is The rarest of all women Go Cleomenes Yourself assisted with your honour'd friends Bring them to our embracement Exeunt Still ' tis strange He thus should steal upon us Had our prince Jewel of children seen this hour he had pair'd Well with this lord there was not full a month Between their births Prithee no more cease Thou know'st He dies to me again when talk'd of Sure When I shall see this gentleman thy speeches Will bring me to consider that which may Unfurnish me of reason By his command Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him Give you all greetings that a king at friend Can send his brother and but infirmity Which waits upon worn times hath something seiz'd His wish'd ability he had himself The lands and waters ' twixt your throne and his Measur'd to look upon you whom he loves He bade me say so more than all the sceptres And those that bear them living O my brother- Good gentleman!- the wrongs I have done thee stir Afresh within me and these thy offices So rarely kind are as interpreters Of my behind hand slackness Welcome hither As is the spring to th ' earth And hath he too Expos'd this paragon to th ' fearful usage At least ungentle of the dreadful Neptune To greet a man not worth her pains much less Th ' adventure of her person Good my lord She came from Libya Where the warlike Smalus That noble honour'd lord is fear'd and lov'd Most royal sir from thence from him whose daughter His tears proclaim'd his parting with her thence A prosperous south wind friendly we have cross'd To execute the charge my father gave me For visiting your Highness My best train I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd Who for Bohemia bend to signify Not only my success in Libya sir But my arrival and my wife 's in safety Here where we are The blessed gods Purge all infection from our air whilst you Do climate here You have a holy father A graceful gentleman against whose person So sacred as it is I have done sin For which the heavens taking angry note Have left me issueless and your father 's blest As he from heaven merits it with you Worthy his goodness What might I have been Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on Such goodly things as you Most noble sir That which I shall report will bear no credit Were not the proof so nigh Please you great sir Bohemia greets you from himself by me Desires you to attach his son who has- His dignity and duty both cast off- Fled from his father from his hopes and with A shepherd 's daughter Where 's Bohemia Speak Here in your city I now came from him I speak amazedly and it becomes My marvel and my message To your court Whiles he was hast'ning- in the chase it seems Of this fair couple- meets he on the way The father of this seeming lady and Her brother having both their country quitted With this young prince Camillo has betray'd me Whose honour and whose honesty till now Endur'd all weathers Lay't so to his charge He 's with the King your father Who Camillo Camillo sir I spake with him who now Has these poor men in question Never saw I Wretches so quake They kneel they kiss the earth Forswear themselves as often as they speak Bohemia stops his ears and threatens them With divers deaths in death O my poor father The heaven sets spies upon us will not have Our contract celebrated You are married We are not sir nor are we like to be The stars I see will kiss the valleys first The odds for high and low 's alike My lord Is this the daughter of a king She is When once she is my wife That ' once ' I see by your good father 's speed Will come on very slowly I am sorry Most sorry you have broken from his liking Where you were tied in duty and as sorry Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty That you might well enjoy her Dear look up Though Fortune visible an enemy Should chase us with my father pow'r no jot Hath she to change our loves Beseech you sir Remember since you ow'd no more to time Than I do now With thought of such affections Step forth mine advocate at your request My father will grant precious things as trifles Would he do so I 'd beg your precious mistress Which he counts but a trifle Sir my liege Your eye hath too much youth in't Not a month Fore your queen died she was more worth such gazes Than what you look on now I thought of her Even in these looks I made To FLORIZEL But your petition Is yet unanswer'd I will to your father Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires I am friend to them and you Upon which errand I now go toward him therefore follow me And mark what way I make Come good my lord Exeunt Beseech you sir were you present at this relation I was by at the opening of the fardel heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon after a little amazedness we were all commanded out of the chamber only this methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child I would most gladly know the issue of it I make a broken delivery of the business but the changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration They seem'd almost with staring on one another to tear the cases of their eyes there was speech in their dumbness language in their very gesture they look'd as they had heard of a world ransom'd or one destroyed A notable passion of wonder appeared in them but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if th ' importance were joy or sorrow- but in the extremity of the one it must needs be Nothing but bonfires The oracle is fulfill'd the King 's daughter is found Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad makers can not be able to express it Most true if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance That which you hear you 'll swear you see there is such unity in the proofs The mantle of Queen Hermione 's her jewel about the neck of it the letters of Antigonus found with it which they know to be his character the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding and many other evidences- proclaim her with all certainty to be the King 's daughter Did you see the meeting of the two kings No Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen can not be spoken of There might you have beheld one joy crown another so and in such manner that it seem'd sorrow wept to take leave of them for their joy waded in tears There was casting up of eyes holding up of hands with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment not by favour Our king being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter as if that joy were now become a loss cries ' O thy mother thy mother ' then asks Bohemia forgiveness then embraces his son in law then again worries he his daughter with clipping her Now he thanks the old shepherd which stands by like a weather bitten conduit of many kings ' reigns I never heard of such another encounter which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it What pray you became of Antigonus that carried hence the child Like an old tale still which will have matter to rehearse though credit be asleep and not an ear open he was torn to pieces with a bear This avouches the shepherd 's son who has not only his innocence which seems much to justify him but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows What became of his bark and his followers Wreck'd the same instant of their master 's death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found But O the noble combat that ' twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina She had one eye declin'd for the loss of her husband another elevated that the oracle was fulfill'd She lifted the Princess from the earth and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes for by such was it acted One of the prettiest touches of all and that which angl'd for mine eyes- caught the water though not the fish- was when at the relation of the Queen 's death with the manner how she came to't bravely confess'd and lamented by the King how attentivenes wounded his daughter till from one sign of dolour to another she did with an ' Alas!'- I would fain say- bleed tears for I am sure my heart wept blood Who was most marble there changed colour some swooned all sorrowed If all the world could have seen't the woe had been universal Are they returned to the court No The Princess hearing of her mother 's statue which is in the keeping of Paulina- a piece many years in doing and now newly perform'd by that rare Italian master Julio Romano who had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work would beguile nature of her custom so perfectly he is her ape He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer- thither with all greediness of affection are they gone and there they intend to sup I thought she had some great matter there in hand for she hath privately twice or thrice a day ever since the death of Hermione visited that removed house Shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing Who would be thence that has the benefit of access Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge Let 's along Now had I not the dash of my former life in me would preferment drop on my head I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what but he at that time over fond of the shepherd 's daughter- so he then took her to be- who began to be much sea sick and himself little better extremity of weather continuing this mystery remained undiscover'd But ' tis all one to me for had I been the finder out of this secret it would not have relish'd among my other discredits Come boy I am past moe children but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born You are well met sir You denied to fight with me this other day because I was no gentleman born See you these clothes Say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born You were best say these robes are not gentlemen born Give me the lie do and try whether I am not now a gentleman born I know you are now sir a gentleman born Ay and have been so any time these four hours And so have I boy So you have but I was a gentleman born before my father for the King 's son took me by the hand and call'd me brother and then the two kings call'd my father brother and then the Prince my brother and the Princess my sister call'd my father father And so we wept and there was the first gentleman like tears that ever we shed We may live son to shed many more Ay or else ' twere hard luck being in so preposterous estate as we are I humbly beseech you sir to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the Prince my master Prithee son do for we must be gentle now we are gentlemen Thou wilt amend thy life Ay an it like your good worship Give me thy hand I will swear to the Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia You may say it but not swear it Not swear it now I am a gentleman Let boors and franklins say it I 'll swear it How if it be false son If it be ne'er so false a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend And I 'll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk But I 'll swear it and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands I will prove so sir to my power Ay by any means prove a tall fellow If I do not wonder how thou dar'st venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow trust me not Hark the kings and the princes our kindred are going to see the Queen 's picture Come follow us we 'll be thy good masters Exeunt O grave and good Paulina the great comfort That I have had of thee What sovereign sir I did not well I meant well All my services You have paid home but that you have vouchsaf'd With your crown'd brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms my poor house to visit It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answer O Paulina We honour you with trouble but we came To see the statue of our queen Your gallery Have we pass'd through not without much content In many singularities but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon The statue of her mother As she liv'd peerless So her dead likeness I do well believe Excels whatever yet you look'd upon Or hand of man hath done therefore I keep it Lonely apart But here it is Prepare To see the life as lively mock'd as ever Still sleep mock'd death Behold and say ' tis well Her natural posture Chide me dear stone that I may say indeed Thou art Hermione or rather thou art she In thy not chiding for she was as tender As infancy and grace But yet Paulina Hermione was not so much wrinkled nothing So aged as this seems O not by much So much the more our carver 's excellence Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she liv'd now As now she might have done So much to my good comfort as it is Now piercing to my soul O thus she stood Even with such life of majesty- warm life As now it coldly stands- when first I woo'd her I am asham'd Does not the stone rebuke me For being more stone than it O royal piece There 's magic in thy majesty which has My evils conjur'd to remembrance and From thy admiring daughter took the spirits Standing like stone with thee And give me leave And do not say ' tis superstition that I kneel and then implore her blessing Lady Dear queen that ended when I but began Give me that hand of yours to kiss O patience The statue is but newly fix'd the colour 's Not dry My lord your sorrow was too sore laid on Which sixteen winters can not blow away So many summers dry Scarce any joy Did ever so long live no sorrow But kill'd itself much sooner Dear my brother Let him that was the cause of this have pow'r To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself Indeed my lord If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you- for the stone is mine- I 'd not have show'd it Do not draw the curtain No longer shall you gaze on't lest your fancy May think anon it moves Let be let be Would I were dead but that methinks already- What was he that did make it See my lord Would you not deem it breath'd and that those veins Did verily bear blood Masterly done The very life seems warm upon her lip The fixture of her eye has motion in't As we are mock'd with art I 'll draw the curtain My lord 's almost so far transported that He 'll think anon it lives O sweet Paulina Make me to think so twenty years together No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness Let ' t alone I am sorry sir I have thus far stirr'd you but I could afflict you farther Do Paulina For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort Still methinks There is an air comes from her What fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath Let no man mock me For I will kiss her Good my lord forbear The ruddiness upon her lip is wet You 'll mar it if you kiss it stain your own With oily painting Shall I draw the curtain No not these twenty years So long could I Stand by a looker on Either forbear Quit presently the chapel or resolve you For more amazement If you can behold it I 'll make the statue move indeed descend And take you by the hand but then you 'll think- Which I protest against- I am assisted By wicked powers What you can make her do I am content to look on what to speak I am content to hear for ' tis as easy To make her speak as move It is requir'd You do awake your faith Then all stand still Or those that think it is unlawful business I am about let them depart Proceed No foot shall stir Music awake her strike Music ' Tis time descend be stone no more approach Strike all that look upon with marvel Come I 'll fill your grave up Stir nay come away Bequeath to death your numbness for from him Dear life redeems you You perceive she stirs O she 's warm If this be magic let it be an art Lawful as eating She embraces him She hangs about his neck If she pertain to life let her speak too Ay and make it manifest where she has liv'd Or how stol'n from the dead That she is living Were it but told you should be hooted at Like an old tale but it appears she lives Though yet she speak not Mark a little while Please you to interpose fair madam Kneel And pray your mother 's blessing Turn good lady Our Perdita is found You gods look down And from your sacred vials pour your graces Upon my daughter 's head Tell me mine own Where hast thou been preserv'd Where liv'd How found Thy father 's court For thou shalt hear that I Knowing by Paulina that the oracle Gave hope thou wast in being have preserv'd Myself to see the issue There 's time enough for that Lest they desire upon this push to trouble Your joys with like relation Go together You precious winners all your exultation Partake to every one I an old turtle Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there My mate that 's never to be found again Lament till I am lost O peace Paulina Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent As I by thine a wife This is a match And made between 's by vows Thou hast found mine But how is to be question'd for I saw her As I thought dead and have in vain said many A prayer upon her grave I 'll not seek far- For him I partly know his mind- to find thee An honourable husband Come Camillo And take her by the hand whose worth and honesty Is richly noted and here justified By us a pair of kings Let 's from this place What look upon my brother Both your pardons That e'er I put between your holy looks My ill suspicion This your son in law And son unto the King whom heavens directing Is troth plight to your daughter Good Paulina Lead us from hence where we may leisurely Each one demand and answer to his part Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first We were dissever'd Hastily lead away Exeunt\""
